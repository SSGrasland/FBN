## What is Feminist Bookstore News (FBN)?

Feminist Bookstore News (FBN) was a trade newsletter that contained news on the publishing world, book lists and recommendations, strategies for running a bookstore, and all things useful to feminist booksellers. It is a valuable trove of bookselling knowledge, a glimpse into the feminist and lesbian-feminist movement, and an extensive archive of books by women. It was published from 1976 to 2000.

## What is the FBN Project?

We are currently working on a database of FBN articles that researchers can use to conduct statistical analysis on FBN. The goal is to complete this database by the end of summer 2023.

### Future ideas include:
A database of all the books mentioned in FBN
A database of all the feminist bookstores mentioned in FBN
A short book or zine anthologizing FBN's bookselling advice
An anthology of relevant FBN articles

## How to Get Involved

We need help with filling out the database of articles. To get started, email Julie (julie@sinisterwisdom.org) to be added to our Google Group!
