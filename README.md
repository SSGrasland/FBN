## What is Feminist Bookstore News (FBN)?

Feminist Bookstore News (FBN) was a trade newsletter that contained news on the publishing world, book lists and recommendations, strategies for running a bookstore, and all things useful to feminist booksellers. It is a valuable trove of bookselling knowledge, a glimpse into the feminist and lesbian-feminist movement, and an extensive archive of books by women. It was published from 1976 to 2000.

## What is the FBN Project?

We are currently working on a database of FBN articles that researchers can use to conduct statistical analysis on FBN. 

### Goals include:
A database of all the books mentioned in FBN    
A database of all the feminist bookstores mentioned in FBN     
A short book or zine anthologizing FBN's bookselling advice     
An anthology of relevant FBN articles
