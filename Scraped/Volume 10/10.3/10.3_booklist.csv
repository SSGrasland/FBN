Harriet Fordham Croft, a robust, older, divorced Toronto lawyer who has bouts of inexplicable loneliness, is called onto the case by Marcie's sleazy husband: he wants to be sure that Leslie is prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But Harriet, attracted by Leslie's courage and forthrightness, suspects that the community's hostility to lesbianism has resulted in her being railroaded. After Leslie fires her scummy local lawyer, Harriet agrees to represent her and, in firm fashion, proves her innocence and gets the murderer to confess on the stand during the trial. Upon Leslie's release, Harriet realizes that she has fallen in love with her client, and the two make their first tender overtures. As a mystery, this book fails. (Not enough information is given until the end for the reader to speculate satisfyingly about other murder suspects.) As a feminist narative, it's passable.

It is the force that drives problem-solving, informs effective decision-making and opens new frontiers for ambition and intelligence. Those who succeed have learned to harness their creative power by keeping that light bulb turned on.<P>Now, Betty Edwards, author of <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,</i> the million-copy best-seller that proved all people can draw well just as they <i>can read well,</i> has decoded the secrets of the creative process to help you tap your full creative potential and apply that power to everyday problems. How does Betty Edwards do this? Through the power of drawing &#151; power you can harness to <i>see problems in new ways.</i><P>Through simple step-by-step exercises that require no special artistic abilities, Betty Edwards will teach you how to take a new point of view, how to look at things from a different perspective, how to see the forest <i>and</i> the trees, in short, how to bring your <i>visual, perceptual brainpower</i> to bear on creative problem-solving.<P>You will learn how the creative process progresses from stage to stage and how to move your own problem-solving through these key steps&#58;<P>* First insight<P>* Saturation<P>* Incubation<P>* Illumination (the Ah-Ha!)<P>* Verification<P>Whether you are a business manager, teacher, writer, technician, or student, you'll find <i>Drawing on the Artist Within</i> the most effective program ever created for tapping your creative powers. Profusely illustrated with hundreds of instructional drawings and the work of master artists, this book iswritten for people with no previous experience in art.<br></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>This work extends the ideas and meth ods presented in Edwards's Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain ( LJ 7/79). She believes (and offers substantial proof) that most people cannot draw because they have not been trained to see. She also posits that once we have mastered the basics of drawing and thereby enhanced our right-side brain function, we will be more creative. Ed wards's methods do enable one to per ceive things differently, and they have produced astounding results from her students, as examples included here show. As she states, the basics of draw ing should be as important to our edu cation as the basics of reading. The ac quisition by most libraries of this excellent manual would be one step in that direction. Patricia R.
