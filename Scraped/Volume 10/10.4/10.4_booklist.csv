Edwards,Beacon Pr,357.0,1987,,Paperback,"<p>Amelia Ann Blandford Edwards (1831-1892) was an English novelist, a journalist, a lady traveller and an Egyptologist. She published her first poem at the age of 7 and her first story at the age of 12. Amelia thereafter proceeded to publish a variety of poetry, stories and articles in a large number of magazines that included Chamber's Journal, Household Words and All the Year Round. She also wrote for the newspapers, the Saturday Review and the Morning Post. Her first full-length novel was My Brother's Wife (1855). Her early novels were well received, but it was Barbara's History (1864), a novel of bigamy, that solidly established her reputation as a novelist. Her last novel, Lord Brackenbury (1880), emerged as a run-away success which went to 15 editions. She wrote a book in 1876 under the title of A Thousand Miles up the Nile. Enhanced with her own hand-drawn illustrations, the travelogue became an immediate bestseller.</p>",en,First Edition,Weight: 0.8 Pounds,1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/76/9780807070376.jpg,Success,26.0,10.4

In response to this heightened activity Barry D. Adam has updated his 1987 study of the movement to offer a critical reflection on strategies and objectives that have been developed for the protection and welfare of those who love others of their own sex. This revised volume addresses the movement's recovery of momentum in the wake of New Right campaigns and its gains in human rights and domestic partners' legislation in several countries; the impact of AIDS on movement issues and strategies and the renewal of militant tactics through AIDS activism and Queer Nation; internal debates that continually shift the meanings composing homosexual, gay, lesbian, and queer identities and cultures; the proliferation of new movement groups in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa; and new developments in historical scholarship that are enriching our understanding of same-sex bonding in the past. Adam delineates the formation of gay and lesbian movements as truly a world phenomenon, exploring their histories in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and countries for which very little information about the activities of gay men and lesbians has been made available. In this global picture of the mobilization of homosexuals Adam identifies the critical factors that have given personal and historical subjectivity to desire, that have shaped the faces and territories of homosexual people, and that have generated homophobia and heterosexism. Treating the sociological aspects of the rise of the gay and lesbian movement, Adam also looks at ""new social movements"" theory in relation to the gay and lesbian movement and cultural nationalism - whether in the form of cultural feminism or queer nationalism - which he considers an important, perhaps inevitable, moment in the empowerment of inferiorized people",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 0.75 Inches, Weight: 0.56879263596 Pounds, Width: 5.75 Inches",15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/52/9780805797152.jpg,Success,75.0,10.4
