She can learn how to assume power over her relationships, mind, body, and positions in society. Leading feminist therapists provide methods that can help women make their aspirations for power a reality—in the workplace, in social situations, in intimate relationships. Topics include black women and the politics of skin color and hair agoraphobic women and behavior change, unlearning victim behavior, decision-making about contraception, single mothers by choice, female alcoholism and affiliation needs, and much more.
<p>This volume is on the cutting edge of the rapidly expanding body of literature and knowledge in women’s studies, and describes new and frequently controversial ideas and programs. It deals with issues of power over the intimacies of women's bodies and psyches, as well as power in the workplace, professional societies, and the courts. In order to help the reader understand these issues more fully, this fine book also describes some of the historical and social contexts in which women have not had power or have gained power.</p>


                        <p>Presents new and frequently controversial ideas and programs that enable women to change the way in which they assume power in every part of their lives.

They express anger at the failure of traditional psychiatry and psychology--which tend to advocate assimilation, meaning the denial of one's cultural and historical identity--to understand the struggles and problems in their lives. The contributors to The Psychopathology of Everyday Racism and Sexism--who come from both inside and outside the psychological disciplines--examine newer therapies in which women are encouraged to identify and express emotional reactions to other people, racism, and abuse and to expose the humiliation they feel. These new therapeutic processes--representing a milestone in psychological theory and practice--help women of color develop their historical identity and reject socially-induced shame and degredation.The editor of this vital book is Lenora Fulani, a developmental psychologist and an active political leader. Dr. Fulani explores how a lack of power over one's life and deprivation of a sense of oneself as historical are commonly associated with psychological problems. The added stress of low social status, sexual exploitation, poverty, abuse, and drug and alcohol problems, result in an enormous sense of failure and incredible vulnerability to emotional stress. With passion and compassion, The Psychopathology of Everyday Racism and Sexism advocates an empowering sense of community based on the power of and love for the oppressed.",en,4,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.5732018812 Pounds, Width: 0.32 Inches",34.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/17/9780918393517.jpg,Success,58,10.6

Experts examine the role of alcohol and other drugs in the AIDS epidemic and suggest guidelines to chemical dependency professionals for halting the spread of the disease. They also offer insights into whether some drugs alter the immune system, whether drugs and alcohol play a role in predisposing some people to AIDS, and whether there are neurological, psychiatric, and medical differences between those who get the disease and those who don't. This challenging volume addresses some controversial issues, including mandatory AIDS testing, public health issues, the current and future trends of AIDS, and the legal, moral, and ethical implications of AIDS on chemical dependency programs.</p>
