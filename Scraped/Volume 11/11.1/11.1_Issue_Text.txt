Taken all together, The British Feminist
Book Fortnight creates an amazing amount of
publicity for feminist titles and creates a
national recognition for feminist writing and
publishing. Several industry observers have
suggested that the stability of the mid-sized
feminist publishers dates from the publicity
received via the First International Feminist
Bookfair (held in London) and the first Feminist

History's first feminist writer-
Sappho
poems and fragments
translated by Josephine Balmer
Sappho was the first--and arguably the finest--of lesbian
poets. She wrote in the 6th century B.C. and has remained an
inspiration for poets and lovers ever since.
This new translation is the first in more than thirty years.
It brings together all the extant poems and fragments of this
important poet. It includes an introduction by the translator,
and is complete with footnotes, a glossary and reading list. a

Red and Black Books is a multi-faceted non-sectarian leftist
bookstore in Seattle that began selling books in the early seven-
ties. For eight years they enjoyed a "good" location on the main
shopping street in the university district.
It all just "worked." Nearly a quarter of their sales came
from walk-in traffic, they developed a steady and committed
clientele for the political and movement books they sold, they
had a solid group of university lefties to buy the esoteric and
hardcore (and cloth) political theory books. Rent was low and the
cash flowed. They never even took an inventory for eight years.
Then they complained to the landlord about the growing leaks
in the roof. He evicted them.
And so began the saga of Red and Black's moves. The first
move was a disaster. Bad location, no foot-traffic, and they:
weren't in a neighborhood that was likely to support a lefty
store with growing feminist and gay tendencies. In the first
location they lost $10,000 in six months.
In an effort to save the store, they moved again, this time
to an upstairs location above a well-known political coffee house
in a significantly gay and somewhat lesbian neighborhood. At that
point, R&B collective members settled down to study bookstore
economics to get a grip on their situation. Collective member
Judy Bierman and Sherry "Red" Reddick did a workshop on Bookstore
Economics for Health and Survival at the 1983 Northwest Women In
Print Conference. Their workshop was written up and published in
the September 1983 issue of FBN, and was reprinted last spring in
FBN's Tenth Anniversary issue.

Why Can't Sharon Kowalski Come Home?
by Karen Thompson and Julie Andrzejewski
In 1983, Sharon Kowalski was seriously injured when her car was hit by a drunken
driver. For the next two years, Karen, her lover of four years, was by Sharon's bedside,
helping her in the arduous fight to regain basic life skills. Then the court awarded Shar-
on's father sole guardianship, and within 24 hours he denied Karen visitation rights.
This is the very personal and moving story of two women: Sharon whose basic
civil rights are being denied by her guardian's decisions, decisions crucial to her re-
covery; and Karen who, changing her entire life and outlook, has courageously
fought battle after battle for her lover's right to choose her own life, for Sharon's
right to come home again.
