0-1950-4564-5,The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England,"Hanawalt, Barbara A.",Oxford University Press,364.0,1988,,Paperback,"<br>
Barbara A. Hanawalt's richly detailed account offers an intimate view of everyday life in Medieval England that seems at once surprisingly familiar and yet at odds with what many experts have told us. She argues that the biological needs served by the family do not change and that the ways fourteenth- and fifteenth-century peasants coped with such problems as providing for the newborn and the aged, controlling premarital sex, and alleviating the harshness of their material environment in many ways correspond with our twentieth-century solutions.
<p>Using a remarkable array of sources, including over 3,000 coroners' inquests into accidental deaths, Hanawalt emphasizes the continuity of the nuclear family from the middle ages into the modern period by exploring the reasons that families served as the basic unit of society and the economy. Providing such fascinating details as a citation of an incantation against rats, evidence of the hierarchy of bread consumption, and descriptions of the games people played, her study illustrates the flexibility of the family and its capacity to adapt to radical changes in society. She notes that even the terrible population reduction that resulted from the Black Death did not substantially alter the basic nature of the family.</p>

Ellmann skillfully marshals his material (some of it new), and he writes brilliantly but unobtrusively. A masterpiece to match Ellmann's James Joyce (1959), this work is certain to trigger renewed interest in Wilde.

Barbara Caine juxtaposes the normal pattern of the Potters' lives with some of the extraordinary conflicts and tragedies that took place behind the respectable facade of traditional Victorian and Edwardian family life. Highlighting some of these tensions and pressures-including the suicide of one sister, the death of another probably induced by the cocaine she took after a family breakdown, and the shock the older sisters experienced as a result of their younger sister's sexual promiscuity-Caine demonstrates how they came together, in times of crisis, as a support network for one another. They recognized that the sisterhood provided the only security in a society which made women socially, legally, and economically subordinate to men.<br> Making full use of the vast collection of letters and diaries left by the Potters, Caine enhances our understanding of Beatrice Webb herself, as we see her through the eyes of her family, and through her reactions to their trials and tribulations. Contributing greatly to the social history of Victorian and early Edwardian England, <b>Destined to be Wives</b> offers many invaluable insights into the problems and sufferings that women faced during this period.</p>",en,,"Height: 7.69 Inches, Length: 5.06 Inches, Width: 0.81 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/84/9780192821584.jpg,Success,40.0,11.4

He skillfully explores the whole corpus of moral reflection among philosophers (Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) and physicians of the era, and uncovers an increasing mistrust of pleasure and growing anxiety over sexual activity and its consequences.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>In this absorbing study, Foucault discusses the attitudes toward sexuality prevalent in Hellenistic Greece and Rome. Classical Greece's view of sex as a means of obtaining individual pleasure faced increasing challenge in Hellenistic times. The love of boys now assumed more muted tones, often finding itself at odds with the highly valued ideals of marital fidelity and virginity. The Stoic approach, as Foucault demonstrates in a nuanced discussion, both resembled and differed from the asceticism of Christianity. This volume, perhaps the last that will appear of the author's posthumous History of Sexuality ( LJ 10/15/78; 12/1/85) manifests Foucault's powerful analytic ability. Though at times it draws very broad conclusions from the discussion of relatively few texts, it is still highly recommended.

In this provocative study, Elinor Accampo explores the interrelationship between the structure of work and strategies of family formation in Saint Chamond, a French city that underwent intensive industrialization during the nineteenth century. Through a detailed analysis of fertility, mortality, marriages, and migration, the author analyzes the ways in which the family responded to changes in the organization of work.<br>
In the first half of the nineteenth century work was in the home, and families tended to be large in order to meet the demand for workers. But by the 1860s the mechanization of labor had begun to separate family life and work life, fundamentally transforming the relationship between work and family and making the survival of the working-class family more difficult. Accampo argues that workers began to have smaller families much earlier than has previously been suggested, and she demonstrates that fertility declined for reasons unique to working-class conditions. This decline in family size, and the context in which it took place, provides fascinating new material for understanding the working class world and the dynamics of class relations.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.10892517786 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",11.75,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/51/9780520060951.jpg,Success,33.0,11.4

Howell argues that women's work was the product of the intersection of two systems, one cultural and one economic. Howell shows forcefully that patriarchal family structure, not capitalist development per se, was a decisive factor in determining women's work. Women could enjoy high labor status if they worked within a family production unit or if their labor did not interfere with their domestic responsibilities or threaten male control of a craft or trade.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",41.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/47/9780226355047.jpg,Success,35.0,11.4

They express anger at the failure of traditional psychiatry and psychology--which tend to advocate assimilation, meaning the denial of one's cultural and historical identity--to understand the struggles and problems in their lives. The contributors to The Psychopathology of Everyday Racism and Sexism--who come from both inside and outside the psychological disciplines--examine newer therapies in which women are encouraged to identify and express emotional reactions to other people, racism, and abuse and to expose the humiliation they feel. These new therapeutic processes--representing a milestone in psychological theory and practice--help women of color develop their historical identity and reject socially-induced shame and degredation.The editor of this vital book is Lenora Fulani, a developmental psychologist and an active political leader. Dr. Fulani explores how a lack of power over one's life and deprivation of a sense of oneself as historical are commonly associated with psychological problems. The added stress of low social status, sexual exploitation, poverty, abuse, and drug and alcohol problems, result in an enormous sense of failure and incredible vulnerability to emotional stress. With passion and compassion, The Psychopathology of Everyday Racism and Sexism advocates an empowering sense of community based on the power of and love for the oppressed.",en,4,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.5732018812 Pounds, Width: 0.32 Inches",34.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/17/9780918393517.jpg,Success,48.0,11.4

Nancy Walker proposes that the American humorous tradition to be redefined to include women's humor as well as men's, because, contrary to popular opinion, women do have a sense of humor.</p><p>Her book draws on history, sociology, anthropology, literature, and psychology to posit that the reasons for neglect of women's humorous expression are rooted in a male-dominated culture that has officially denied women the freedom and self-confidence essential to the humorist. Rather than a study of individual writers, the book is an exploration of relationships between cultural realities-including expectations of true womanhood-and women's humorous response to those realities.</p><p>Humorous expression, Walker maintains, is at odds with the culturally sanctioned ideal of the lady, and much of women's humor seems to accept, while actually denying, this ideal. In fact, most of American women's humorous writing has been a feminist critique of American culture and its attitudes toward women, according to the author.</p>",en,1,"Height: 5.5 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.62 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",24.86,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/36/9780816617036.jpg,Success,33.0,11.4

<p>Born in 1911, McNeill tells the story of her own growing years on the farm through the circadian rhythms of rural life.&nbsp; She presents the farm itself, “its level fields, its fence row, and hilly pastures . . . some two hundred acres of trees and bluegrass, running water, and the winding, dusty paths that cattle and humans have kept open through the years.”&nbsp; She writes movingly of the harsh routines of the lives of her family, from spring ploughing to winter sugaring, and of the hold the farm itself has on them and the earth itself on all of us.</p>
<p>By the 1930s, the farm and the surrounding community had been drastically changed by the destruction left by the lumber companies, by the increased access to the outside world resulting from railway and automobile, and by war.&nbsp; McNeill herself left the farm in 1937 to complete her college education and to persue her literary career.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>The Milkweed Ladies</i>, McNeill juxtaposes the life of the farm with the larger world events that impinge on it.&nbsp; But the larger world moves closer and closer to the world of the farm as McNeill herself moves away from it.&nbsp; The book concludes with McNeill’s perspective on the events of August 5, 1945.&nbsp; As she sits in the Commodore Hotel in New York City, reading the headlines about Hiroshima, she understands that she can never see the farm in the same way again.</p>
<p><i>The Milkweed Ladies</i> is filled with memorable characters - an herb-gathering Granny, McNeill’s sailor father, her patient, flower-loving mother, and Aunt Malindy in her “black sateen dress” who “never did a lick of work.”&nbsp; With her poet’s gift for detail and language, McNeill creates a world, forgotten by many of us, to some of us never known.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.37 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/64/9780822954064.jpg,Success,37.0,11.4
