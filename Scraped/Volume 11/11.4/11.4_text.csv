New Release
The New Americans
by Ulli Steltzer Intro by Peter Marin
$24.95 (Softcover) ISBN 0-939165-07-4 176 pp 9x12”
With photographs and personal stories, The New Americans
offers insight into the lives of millions of immigrants and
refugees who have come to the U.S. Their arrival brings cultural
changes, crises and possible futures that no one in North
America anticipated prior to their arrival.
A Portrait of American Mothers & Daughters
by Raisa Fastman
$24.95 (Softcover) ISBN 0-939165-04-x 128 pp 10x10”
“Each mother and daughter writes something of her feelings for
the other, and these make absorbing reading. But the words are
merely postscripts to the riveting photographs. Love spills from
many of Fastman’s remarkable pictures.” Gannett News Service
Award. Winner
Women & Work,
Photographs and Personal Writings
$22.95 (Softcover) ISBN 0-939165-01-5 180 pp 11x812”
“This album of excellent pictures, and 85 brief texts covers
women’s work in fields old and new ..….the women pictured here
often seem to merge both images of pioneers and role models
into one — courageous, versatile, persistent human beings of
whom society can be proud.” New York Times Book Review

Now, those people are quite well established and
they are male writers. And because the woman in
South Africa hasn't had the experience and the expo-
sure of writing, she was intimidated because of that
competition. As I worked there I began to feel that we
needed something more than just a publishing house;
that we need a (publishing) house where women can
feel confident to bring their material, let it be edited,
talk to somebody about developing it and working it
out. That was one motivation for actually starting
Seriti sa Sechaba.
Another reason is that the women in South Africa
are the most disadvantaged as far as education is con-
cerned. For various cultural reasons women leave
school earlier, the men have preference over the
women (for) all those reasons that we all know so very
well. So it was intimidating for the ordinary woman,

Adult Early Readers -- two are in the vernacular and
one is in English. The last one is quite a serious book
which looks at the tribal divisions and tries to dis-
courage people from thinking and moving along the
tribal lines. It’s written in the vernacular because it is
targeted to the people who, because of the homeland
systems, are very, very tribal. So I think it’s the right
book at the right time.
Joan: That’s a lot of books!
Dinah: It was a lot of books in a short space of time.
This was also as a result of the Canada invitation (to
the book fair) because if they hadn't invited us I doubt
we would have pushed to produce so many in such
a short space of time. Fortunately AID agreed to print
these books, and of course by this time we had a lot
of manuscripts ready to print.
[Editor's note: It's unclear in the interview, but it seems
that AID’s decision to fund the printing was prompted by
the invitation to speak and exhibit at the International
Feminist Book Fair in Canada.]
Joan: So how many copies do you usually print?
Dinah: It varies. The run for the early readers is 2,500
copies. We do 5,000 copies of the readers for the more
educated women. The children’s books we also put at
5,000 because we are hoping the schools will take
them in bulk.
Joan: The Fireside Tales is just gorgeous! What are you
looking to do in the next year?
Dinah: In the next year we're working on a book
called Heroines of South Africa, which is going to be
very interesting. It’s a research book on women in

to bring us feminist international writing. In addition
to the British, Irish, and Canadian presses mentioned

New Women’s Press from New Zealand, whose list in-
cludes a number of Maori books. Inland also carries
titles from a number of international publishers which
include feminist listings — Zed Books, China Books,

carries titles from Red Sea/ Africa World. Bookpeople
carries a smaller feminist list, but overlaps with Inland
on several publishers — see specific notations below.

that often develop between parents and chil-

In this deeply affecting book of poems Sue
Saniel Elkind rings to fe the reality of aging
in America. At the age of 64, Ms. Elkind
discovered poetry as a natural medium for
expressing her feelings and ideas. Now in her

varied, often conflicting, range of emotions.
Lori Burkhalter - Lackey brings her artistic
skills to the intimate settings of convalescent
homes where she captures the dignity, strength,
pain, and wisdom of her aged subjects.

Three Glasses of Wine Have Been Removed 0- 934578-17-0.
From This Story, by Marian Michener is Silverleaf
Press’ first novel. Two of Michener’s stories were pub-
lished in Silverleaf’s short story collection Crossing
the Mainstream. ""A novel about drinking, loving, and
lesbian life, Three Glasses of Wine is ultimately about
courage and perspective and getting free. Michener
tells the poignant and often funny story of a self-de-
scribed bar-dyke who discovers that while she’s been
partying, life has been passing her by. The reader
knows before Olivia does that she has problems with
alcohol and, as a result, trouble connecting with the
people who are most important in her life. To read
Three Glasses of Wine is to participate in Olivia's
gradual (and often grudging) self- awareness and her
finally successful struggle to become clean and sober."" In Found Goddesses: Asphalta to Viscera (as re-

In Male Daughters, Female Husbands: Gender
and Sex in an African Society Ifi Amadiume argues Chinese American
that sex and gender did not necessarily coincide in Portraits
pre-colonial Igbo society. She examines the structures
that allowed women to achieve the measure of power
and dignity that they did and shows how roles were
not rigidly masculinized or feminizied. Women could
play roles usually monopolized by men and were then
classified as males for the purposes of power — a
classification facilitated by women’s independent
economic resources and the existence of a strong
goddess-focused religion. The colonial period
brought economic changes that undermined women’s
monopoly over the sale of certain foods and reduced
the economic sanctions they could wield over men;
the Church attacked the goddess religion and those
customs that enhanced women’s status; and the
colonial administration's appointment of male war- Banned Books is doing seven books this
