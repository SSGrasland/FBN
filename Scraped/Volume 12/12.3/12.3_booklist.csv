In spite of her three volumes of highly acclaimed memoirs, Hellman has remained an enigma because of her need to conceal her real life and to invent a legend. Rollyson reveals through newly discovered diaries, letters, interviews and state department files the truth about her controversial political activities, personal feuds and numerous tempestuous love affairs. Of particular interest are the real story of how Hellman and Dashiell Hammett formed their liaison, new information about her lawsuit and feud with Mary McCarthy and insight into how Hellman attempted to influence a circle of acolytes to defend her reputation.
<p>Carl Rollyson is Professor of English at Baruch College, The City University of New York.

This is not to say that a utopian workplace is portrayed herein. Exploitation has not been eradicated; equal pay is still the goal, not the reality. Work can often be boring and unfulfilling.<p>But women here are not victims. These are strong women -- survivors. They set boundaries, take risks, demand respect, and maintain their self-esteem, with or without the help of management, coworkers, family or friends. And they do it with a sense of humor! In traditional and nontraditional jobs, at home and in the workplace, these women are using their power to take charge of their own lives, challenging each of us to do the same.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This collection, conceived to broadly address the subject of women's work, focuses mainly on women in dead-end jobs struggling to make ends meet, with little hope of finding fulfilling employment opportunities. In Candida Lawrence's witty tale, ``Spotter,'' for example, Alice labors as a cashier at an amusement park, demeaned by her overzealous boss and the ridiculous uniform she must wear. Nevertheless, several of the stories here are noteworthy for their uncompromising portrayals of women fighting to gain respect and financial security in various work milieus, particularly Karen Loeb's ``Machines,'' Barbara Unger's ``Search Committee'' and Virginia Rudasill Mortenson's ``Hideaway Inn.'' Overall, the poetry tends to be amateurish and cliched. Kate Braid's ``These Hips'' is spoken by a female contractor whose ``strong hips are built for the birth of buildings,'' and Leslea Newman's ``Ode to Secretaries of America'' urges women to ``get up off their chairs and take a walk in the sun.'' The photographs are unexciting representations of women going about their everyday work routines. Martz is editor of Papier-Mache Press.

In the historic decade of the thirties, she was more - a pioneer, a shaper of the medium, and a motivator of the national conscience. Lange's direct, compelling studies of people forced from the land are both a faithful chronicle and a landmark of twentieth-century photography. In her later years, she brought this unique vision to rural communities as diverse as the Mormons of Utah, the countryfolk of Ireland, the fellaheen of Egypt. Dorothea Lange: Photographs of a Lifetime is the most comprehensive collection of the artist's work ever to be published. It begins with portraits from her early years, when she was San Francisco's most fashionable studio photographer, and it concludes with images from her final years, when Lange traveled the globe, then, finally, turned her lens toward children and grandchildren, home, and the familiar objects and events of her daily life. In a penetrating critical biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Coles offers an incisive study of Lange's life and work. As one of the great contemporary social investigators, Coles explores in Lange's methods and accomplishments those qualities that enable the ""artist-observer"" to satisfy the objectivity expected of chroniclers and the subjective emotional involvement of the artist's personal vision. Accompanying the photographs are Lange's own reminiscences and observations, collected from her writings and from interviews made shortly before her death in 1965.

The autobiographical essays reflect on her work and her life as an artist, as African-American, and a woman, while the literary essays examine the writings of such giants as Richard Wright, W.E.B. DuBois, Phyllis Wheatley, Georgia Douglas Johnson, and others. ""Spanning a half-century (1943to 1988), these brilliant, intimate writings capture the flavor of the times and powerfully convey the social and literary thoughts that distinguishes Walker as one of the intellectual beacons of her generation.""-<i>Booklist</i></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>While Walker is generally acknowledged to be an important 20th-century poet and novelist, this first collection of her essays will further secure her place in American political and cultural life. The essays, written over the last 50+ years of Walker's career as a writer, teacher, scholar, and activist, compellingly recount the personal history of a woman for whom individual expression is an essential form of the struggle against racism, sexism, and classism. Her readings of Southern writers represent an original way of thinking about how race figures in the work of white and black writers. Walker's radical humanist perspective ought to reinvigorate current critical `discussions of race, gender, class, and literature.-- Molly Brodsky, Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J.</p>",en,No Edition Stated,"Height: 8.9 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.5621787681 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/40/9781558610040.jpg,Success,59.0,12.3
