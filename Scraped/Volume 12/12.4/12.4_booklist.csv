0-19-558178-4,Yellow Pencils: Contemporary Poetry by New Zealand Women,,Oxford University Press,248.0,1989-01-05,,Paperback,"<p>In 1977, <b>Private Gardens</b>, a pioneering anthology of New Zealand women's poetry, appeared in print. Now eleven years later, we have a new thoroughly up-to-date anthology that spans the entire century and reveals how the boundaries of woman as poet have shifted and enlarged.<br>
 Helping to establish a literary history of New Zealand women, <b>An Anthology of Poetry by New Zealand Women</b> presents a body of work that represents not only the well-known poets—such as Lauris Edmond, Janet Frame, Keri Hulme, Riemke Ensing, Rachel McAlpine, Elizabeth Smither, and Heather Macpherson—but also a large selection of previously-unknown younger poets—including Michelle Leggott, Jenny Bornholdt, and Susan Allpress—who deserve recognition for their diversity, energy, and expansion of ideas.<br>
 Focusing on the exploration of identity, the business of being a poet, and the constructions and deconstructions of language, these poems raise many essential social, cultural, and political questions concerning the importance of gender in writing and publishing not only in New Zealand but throughout the world. They openly treat many taboo subjects and emotions, including menstruation, sex, pregnancy, rape, incest, anger and hostility, in order to exorcise past stereotypes. Using lovers, wives, mothers, and daughters as subjects in their poetry, the poets re-examine gender relationships and question received identities. Together, their voices reveal the woman poet's changing perception of herself and desire to maintain humanity amongst the dominating anxieties of the late twentieth century.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.31 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Width: 0.63 Inches",13.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/82/9780195581782.jpg,Success,77.0,12.4

Now in this innovative new workbook, she presents a step-by-step journal-keeping method for moving toward recovery from codependence. Based on such concepts as the ""precious child"" and the five core symptoms of codependence, along with the Twelve-Step process of recovery used by Codependents Anonymous, <b>Breaking Free</b> provides strategies and insights for attacking the fundamental problem in codependence—the lack of dependence on self.</p>
<p>In a three-part approach to recovery, Mellody first shows recovering codependents how to move beyond denial of their childhood history of abuse. She then offers techniques to identify concrete ways in which the symptoms of codependence operate in their lives. Finally, Mellody guides users through the process of identifying and recording specific instances of improvement in their lives as an aid to greater self-awareness and further recovery.</p>

The exposition partially exemplifies her hope to locate a ``woman-centered'' way of thinking: the author considers the poems, fictions, testimonies and artwork of women and she outlines the experiences and conditions that inform her own point of view (she grew up in New York, in a middle-class, Communist, Jewish family; she married and divorced; she lives with her lesbian lover and their children)--but she withholds reference to the notoriety her politics have brought her. Commendably, Aptheker attempts to address the distinct needs of minority women; in doing so, however, she becomes patroniz ing. Similarly naive are her privileging of lesbian women (``A lesbian presence signals a potential for female independence'') and her colorless interpretations of the art she cites.
