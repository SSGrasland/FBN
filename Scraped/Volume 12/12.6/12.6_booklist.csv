0-8032-8156-0,A Stranger in Her Native Land: Alice Fletcher and the American Indians (Women in the West),"Mark, Joan T.",Bison Books,428.0,1989-01-01,,Paperback,"<p>Called ""Her Majesty"" because of her resemblance to Queen Victoria and known as ""the measuring woman"" among the Indians whose land allotments she administered, Alice Fletcher (1838&#8211;1923) commanded respect from both friend and foe. She was the foremost woman anthropologist in the United States in the nineteenth century and instrumental in the adoption of the policy of severalty that dominated Indian affairs in the 1880s. This is the full and intimate story of a woman who, as she grew in understanding of Indian ways, came to recognize that she was the one who was alien, a stranger in her native land. <P>Joan Mark recreates the long and active life of Alice Fletcher from diaries, correspondence, and other records, placing her achievements for the first time in a feminist perspective. Sustained by a sense of mission, Alice Fletcher challenged her society's definition of what women could be and do.</P></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Written from a feminist viewpoint, this intriguing, scholarly biography recounts the life of Alice Fletcher, a 19th century anthropologist who championed the rights of American Indians. In 1881 at age 43, Fletcher gave up her career as a public lecturer and traveled west to the Dakota Territory where she observed the Sioux. From there she went to Nebraska to live with the Omaha, and then on to Idaho where she camped with the Nez Perce. Among the remarkable woman's political accomplishments was a congressional bill providing for individual land allotments to reservation Indians. Using Fletcher's personal journals and letters, Mark ( Four Anthropologists ) draws intelligent conclusions about Fletcher's character: her need for a family, a home and a cause, all of which she discovered among the Indians. ``Living with my Indian friends I found I was a stranger in my native land,'' Fletcher wrote. ``I learned to hear the echoes of a time when every living thing even the sky had a voice. That voice devoutly heard by the ancient people of America I desired to make audible to others.'' Illustrations not seen by PW.

Heilbrun's groundbreaking essay ""The Character of Hamlet's Mother"" was published in 1957 at a time when few critics thought seriously about women's issues in literature.

Now in a new paperback edition with a new preface by the author, this collection explores feminism in literary studies during the last three decades. By questioning the gender arrangements of society, Heilbrun has helped to transform them. Taken together, these graceful essays demonstrate the consistency and clarity of Heilbrun's vision and her deep respect for the lives of women who write.</p>

Full Color.</p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>this Version Of The Red Riding Hood Story From Young ( The Emperor And The Kite ; Cats Are Cats ; Yeh-shen ) Features Three Daughters Left At Home When Their Mother Goes To Visit Their Grandmother. Lon Po Po, The Granny Wolf, Pretends To Be The Girls' Grandmother, Until Clever Shang, The Eldest Daughter, Suspects The Greedy Wolf's Real Identity. Tempting Him With Ginkgo Nuts, The Girls Pull Him In A Basket To The Top Of The Tree In Which They Are Hiding, Then Let Go Of The Rope--killing Him. One Of Young's Most Arresting Illustrations Accompanies His Dedication: ``to All The Wolves Of The World For Lending Their Good Name As A Tangible Symbol For Our Darkness.'' Like Ancient Oriental Paintings, The Illustrations Are Frequently Grouped In Panels. When The Girls Meet The Wolf, E.g., The Left Panel Focuses On Their Wary Faces Peering Out From The Darkness, The Middle Enlarges The Evil Wolf's Eye And Teeth, And The Third Is A Vivid Swirl Of The Blue Clothes In Which The Wolf Is Disguised. The Juxtaposition Of Abstract And Realistic Representations, The Complicated Play Of Color And Shadow, And The Depth Of The Artist's Vision All Help Transform This Simple Fairy Tale Into An Extraordinary And Powerful Book.

By examining skeletons and grave goods, archeological evidence from settlement sites, and rock carvings and sculpted figurines, and by drawing anthropological parallels to later societies, Ehrenberg throws new light on the lives and social status of women in Europe from the Palaeolithic era to the Iron Age. The high status almost certainly enjoyed by women as the main providers of food in early prehistoric societies probably diminished in the later Neolithic Age, as men assumed an increasingly dominant role in farming. Even so, in the Bronze Age and Iron Age societies, individual women held positions of power&#58; Ehrenberg considers the possibility that Minoan Crete was a matriarchy and that Boudica was only one of a number of female Celtic leaders.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Ehrenberg argues that the true contribution of women in prehistoric times, especially in the discovery and development of agriculture, was much greater than has been acknowledged to date.
