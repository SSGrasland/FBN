Yet the many names given these women warriors--heroines, camp followers, Amazons, coronelas, soldadas, soldaderas, and Adelitas--indicate their ambivalent position within Mexican society. In this original study, Elizabeth Salas explores the changing role of the soldadera, both in reality and as a cultural symbol, from pre-Columbian times up to the present day.
<p>Drawing on military archival data, anthropological studies, and oral history interviews, Salas first explores the real roles played by Mexican women in armed conflicts. She finds that most of the functions performed by women easily equate to those performed by revolutionaries and male soldiers in the quartermaster corps and regular ranks. She then turns her attention to the soldadera as a continuing symbol in Mexican and Chicano culture, examining the image of the soldadera in literature, corridos, art, music, and film.</p>
<p>Challenging many traditional stereotypes, Salas finds that the fundamental realities of war link all Mexican women, regardless of time period, social class, or nom de guerre.<br>

They express a passionate longing for social justice and for a stable, nurturing relationship between black men and women. Introductions for each author provide biographical information and critical analyses. A useful bibliography of plays and secondary sources is also included. This anthology helps to fill a serious gap in the standard histories of American drama. <i>Library Journal</i></p>
<p><i>Wines in the Wilderness</i> brings together thirteen plays by black women from the 1920s to the present, including works by Marita Bonner, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Eulalie Spence, May Miller, Shirley Graham, Alice Childress, Sonia Sanchez, Sybil Kein, and Elizabeth Brown-Guillory. The plays and dramatists selected are representative of and have made considerable contributions to African American theater.</p>
<p>Although the works of these playwrights span over sixty years, they are closely linked by the theme of women struggling to define their roles in society. The heroines speak out against interracial and intraracial biases, stereotyping, lynch mobs, illiteracy, poverty, promiscuity, self-righteousness, abusive men, rape, and miscegenation. Each play is preceded by a critical introduction that includes biographical information, an assessment of the playwright's contributions to black theater, and a synopsis and critical analysis of the play. The bibliography that follows the plays provides selected lists of published plays, produced plays, and anthologies. An index completes the work. This collection represents an effort to make available plays written by black women that have not been published or are now out of print. In recovering these plays, scholars will now be able to take a close look at the contributions that black women dramatists have made not only to African American theater, but to American theater in general.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1401452 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",86.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/99/9780313265099.jpg,Success,51.0,13.4

But, as A Heart for the Work makes clear, Malawian medical students learn to confront poverty creatively, experiencing fatigue and frustration but also joy and commitment on their way to becoming physicians. The first ethnography of medical training in the global South, Claire L. Wendland's book is a moving and perceptive look at medicine in a world where the transnational movement of people and ideas creates both devastation and possibility.Wendland, a physician anthropologist, conducted extensive interviews and worked in wards, clinics, and operating theaters alongside the student doctors whose stories she relates. From the relative calm of Malawi's College of Medicine to the turbulence of training at hospitals with gravely ill patients and dramatically inadequate supplies, staff, and technology, Wendland's work reveals the way these young doctors engage the contradictions of their circumstances, shedding new light on debates about the effects of medical training, the impact of traditional healing, and the purposes of medicine.<br></p>",eng,1,eBook,0.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/07/9789231021107.jpg,Success,49.0,13.4

This question, asked by a college student trying to write an essay on women in science, planted a seed that grew over a decade of research into this informative and accessible biographical dictionary and bibliography.At the heart of this biographical dictionary are profiles of 186 women whose work is representative of the participation of women in the science of their time and culture. Despite the increasing attention devoted to women's history in recent years, our knowledge of many of these women is still meager,and the book will serve as much as a guide to future research as a resource for historians,librarians, students, and the general public.The book opens with a substantial essay relating the general state of science and philosophical ideas about the role of women in society to the actual participation of women in science over the past two and a half millennia. The classified, annotated bibliography that completes the book can be used as a general research tool as well as a source of information about the particular women whose lives are sketched in this work.The entries provide basic information on their subjects, are referenced to primary sources and other materials in the bibliography, and share an easily flowing narrative style. Beyond that, the length, approach, and focus of the entries have been allowed to vary within an appropriate range to suit the particular women whose lives they recount and whose achievements they evaluate.Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie is a historian of science who teaches at Oklahoma Baptist University.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",0.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/80/9780262650380.jpg,Success,51.0,13.4

In 1959, this scattering of coral atolls was again chosen as the testing site for a new generation of weapons—long-range missiles fired in the U.S. Then in 1984 a missile fired from California was intercepted by one from Kwajalein atoll: SDI, or Star Wars, was declared a realizable dream. As military researcher Owen Wilkes has noted: ""If we could shut down the Pacific Missile Range, we could cut off half the momentum of the nuclear race."" This is the story of the preparations for war which every day impinge on tire lives of Pacific Islanders caught on the cutting edge of the nuclear arms race. It is the story of a displaced people contaminated by nuclear fallout, forcibly resettled as their own islands become uninhabitable, and reduced to lives of poverty, ill-health, and dependence. It is also a stirring account of the Marshall Islanders themselves, of their resilience and protest, and of their attempts to seek redress in the courts.

In No Other Country In The World Have Women Played Such A Decisive Role In The Achievement Of Victory Over An Occupying Enemy And The Creation Of A Communist State. <u>women And Revolution In Yugoslavia</u> Is The First Book In English On Women's Role In The Yugoslav Partisan Movement Of World War Ii.

But At The End Of The 1970s, A New Generation Of Yugoslav Women Began To Challenge These Assumptions Of Emancipation, Calling For Radical Changes In Existing Social Values And Institutions And An End To The Patriarchal Order.

<p class=""quote"">""A historical account like this can be appreciated by scholars of all disciplines who are interested in providing a framework for the discussion of the patriarchal conception of 'woman.' It opens the door to the consideration of the history of women as one of resistance, assertiveness, and creativity.""</p>
<p class=""source""><cite>—Hispanic American Historical Review</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since pre-Columbian times, soldiering has been a traditional life experience for innumerable women in Mexico. Yet the many names given these women warriors—heroines, camp followers, Amazons, <em>coronelas</em>, <em>soldadas</em>, <em>soldaderas</em>, and Adelitas—indicate their ambivalent position within Mexican society. In this original study, Elizabeth Salas explores the changing role of the <em>soldadera</em>, both in reality and as a cultural symbol, from pre-Columbian times up to the present day.</p>
<p>Drawing on military archival data, anthropological studies, and oral history interviews, Salas first explores the real roles played by Mexican women in armed conflicts. She finds that most of the functions performed by women easily equate to those performed by revolutionaries and male soldiers in the quartermaster corps and regular ranks. She then turns her attention to the <em>soldadera</em> as a continuing symbol in Mexican and Chicano culture, examining the image of the <em>soldadera</em> in literature, <em>corridos</em>, art, music, and film.</p>
<p>Challenging many traditional stereotypes, Salas finds that the fundamental realities of war link all Mexican women, regardless of time period, social class, or nom de guerre.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.40213998632 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",13.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/02/9780292776302.jpg,Success,128.0,13.4
