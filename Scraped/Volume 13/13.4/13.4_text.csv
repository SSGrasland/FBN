Kate Millett’s
Sita
The Classic Lesbian Romance
Kate Millett has always loved ‘playing store.’ She
started out in coke bottles at five and stood treats
for the neighborhood kids. For years she’s sold her
art posters to women for preposterous prices (five
to fifty dollars) and her hand-pulled numbered
editions of silkscreens for democratic ones (one
hundred dollars). You can write to her about them
at 295 Bowery, NYC, 10003
Now she has another bee in her bonnet.
When Farrar Stauss remaindered those beautiful hard cover copies of Sita with Kate’s own
drawing on the cover, she said, why not, they’re mine — and bought them up herself. This
year she got the rights back so that Ballantine couldn’t publish any more of its ugly little
paperback and now, as they used to say back home, she’s cornered the market.
And she’s selling these autographed hard cover first
editions of Siza at a discount. For $10.00 each (postage and handling included) to individuals
and to bookstores, she’s offering them for $125.00 for a box of twenty-five— that’s $5.00 each
for a hardcover book whose front flap price was $10.00 then and would be $17.00 now. Free
Freight included!
This is a deal, she says, and she’s gearing up for your
order. Don’t worry, she’s got a lot of books. It’s all part of her “little red hen does it herself”
theory: women taking things into their own hands and writers taking charge of their lives. She’s
probably right — go for it.

The University Press of Virginia is pleased to contemporary social issues. — Gordon Thomas
announce a new series that will unite scholarly, criti-
cal, theoretical and practical work from such tradi-
tionally separate disciplines as anthropology,
psychology, history, religion, philosophy and litera-
ture, as well as science, medicine and law. This inter-
disciplinary focus within the context of feminist
inquiry invites a reconsideration of every aspect of
history and thought.
A series editorial board, composed of 15 feminist
scholars representing a variety of disciplines at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, is chaired by Kathleen Balutansky
and Alison Booth of the English department.
Prospective authors are invited to send letters of
inquiry and proposals to the Editors, Feminist Issues:
Practice, Politics, Theory, University of Virginia, Box

inquiries will receive prompt evaluation and response.

Seven years ago, we launched our Women in the

of Women and Trade Unions, a collection of essays
examining the status of women workers in different
countries. Today, the series holds 22 published books,
six in production and 11 more under contract. Ronnie
J. Steinberg, series editor and sociologist at Temple
University, seeks books that are interdisciplinary,
politically and socially concerned, and cross-national.
The series includes, as does the rest of the Press's list,
works ranging from text books, monographs and
cutting-edge volumes of original essays to first-person
accounts and oral histories. The authors range from
academics and policymakers to activists and folks
without the usual credentials. Series books run the
gamut from women and issues of work, family, social
movements, politics, feminism and empowerment, to
women’s roles and the social construction of gender,

voices and experiences as well as the development of
women’s culture.

works. The book portrays battered women as people
who manage multiple crises despite public inattention
to their plight. Instead of asking “Why do battered
women stay?” it proposes that readers ask “Why
should victims — rather than their assailants — be
expected to leave?” It underscores the need for change
in attitudes, public policy and professional practice to
prevent violence and to reduce its damaging effects on
us all.

Heide: Well, maybe three years ago I would have
answered fiction, and it’s not that way any more.
There's a lot of interest in women’s studies now, for
quite opportunistic reasons, I believe. Since the Insti-
tute de la Mujer, and all the government attention to
women’s issues, the question of women has become
bigger. That, in a way, has taken the preoccupations of
the feminist movement. We don’t have to care about
divorce anymore because now they have a divorce
law. Or we don’t have to care about abortion anymore
because now there is an abortion law — a very, very
bad abortion law, but an abortion law.
These social concerns are, in a way, taken over by
the government. That again means that it's interesting Heide: Comparatively speaking, less fiction,

seems to me, is to develop the kind of strong eco-
nomic support systems within the Women Arts
Movement that are now in place in the Women-In-
Print Movement. Women’s art galleries have not, in
general, proven financially viable, but books, as we
know, have.
Which brings me to a very exciting range of offer-
ings this month. First, Caffyn Kelley has produced a
monograph featuring my art work about growing up
in an alcoholic family. Family by Tee Corinne is small:
sixteen pages, seven illustrations and a color cover,
but the images and text integrate art, biography and
recovery issues in ways that are relevant to feminist
readers, therapists and other artists. Gallery Publi-

One of the really desperate needs in the Women-
In-Art Movement is for serious collectors, people who
gather woman-made images because they love them,
maintain and catalog their collection, see that it is
exhibited, and ultimately find a secure home where
the work will stay available to the public. Two related
new books deal with just such a feminist informed
collector and collection. Journey to Autonomy: A
Memoir by Louise Rosenfield Noun tells of a life spent

Understanding Homosexuality
The Pride and the Prejudice
by Roger E. Biery
From Edward-William Publishing Company
Understanding Homosexuality: The Pride and the Prejudice Ë
is written in an appealing, popular style using a mixture of anecdotes,
empirical evidence, in-depth analysis, and humor. The material, organized
into six sections, is presented in a logical progression that covers everything
from why one in every ten people is gay to how the other nine can learn
to accept their gay friends and family members. The book begins with
definitions of homosexuality, gay, and lesbian, then offers a brief historical
review of the major studies and theories about homosexuality. This leads
into a discussion of stereotypes, gay lifestyles, and the gay community.
The first two sections create an understanding that serves as a foundation
for Section III: confronting personal homophobia.
The second half of the book examines homosexuality in three important
contexts: the church, society, and the family. Section IV addresses religious
concerns, including pertinent passages from the Bible, Judeo-Christian beliefs
about homosexuality, and acceptance of gay members in the church. Section
V explores social issues and the Gay Civil Rights Movement. The final
section applies the knowledge acquired to personal situations by offering
practical advice for gay readers on coming out, and for straight readers
on relating to gay friends and family members.

MANY VOICES introduces a group of American women from Boston, brought together by their
love of theatre, their concern for the quality of women’s lives, and their zest for adventure. Under
the auspices of Streetfeet, a grassroots theatre organization, the authors formed a multi-cultural
company; conceived and wrote a theatre piece reflecting their struggling, joyous sense of them-
7 selves; raised funds; and realized the dream of attending the 1985 United Nations Decade for
Women Conference in Nairobi, Kenya. This book is the journal of their three weeks in Africa.

FOR WOMEN
Dear Feminist Bookseller,
I wanted to take this opportunity to alert you to a project that has been initiated by Los Angeles NOW.
As you may have heard, a book called American Psycho , by Bret Easton Ellis is being published by
Knopf Books. SPY Magazine has characterized this book as ""misogynistic barbarism."" We at Los
Angeles NOW have never seen such an exhibition of such hatred towards women and a degree of
violence against women which is indescribable.
Los Angeles NOW was forwarded a copy of the manuscript. We have read it in its entirety. I cannot
begin to describe to you the atrocities committed against women in this book. Most people think they
can imagine the worse, but you truly have no idea. It is both terrifying and heartbreaking.
Simor & Schuster had the book originally, and nad paid Eilis a $500,000 advarıce. Tiey canceied
publication plans after internal outrage by the women of S&S (who demanded that the book be
rejected) and several extremely negative press accounts of the book.
Immediately after that cancellation, Sonny Mehta of Knopf Books picked it up. Knopf then paid Ellis
another several hundred thousand dollars, placed it with the Knopf paperback line, and has
scheduled a publication date of ""late winter, early spring, 1991.""
We are preparing a nationwide response to Random House for this blatant, indescribable attack on
women. Random House seems determined to bring the torture deaths of women directly into
mainstream literature, ensconcing violence against women as a part of our culture. They clearly thought
that they could proceed with impunity, with not a voiced raised. Let's show them they're wrong!
Our message is that the torture and dismemberment of women is nof socially acceptable, and that we
will not remain silent victims. We are rot telling them to not publish, but as they have the First
Amendment Right to publish what they see fit, we, as consumers, have the right to express our outrage
by choosing to not support Random House or Knopf. In other words, we will be structuring a boycott of
Random House and Knopf. In addition to a consumer response, we will plan other actions including a
phone in and letter writing campaign targeting Alberto Vitali of Random House, Sonny Mehta of
Knopf, and Amanda ""Binky"" Urban, Ellis' agent in New York.
In addition to wanting to inform you about our intentions, we also would like to invite your
participation in the actual structuring of the response to Random House. Please contact me with any
ideas, concerns you may have, and to receive more information. In the midst of the discussion of
boycotting we have not forgotten all of the wonderful women's voices available on both Random House
and Knopf imprints. We are also in the early formative stages of this, so any ideas you can contribute
would be welcomed and appreciated. Our contact numbers are listed below. We look forward to hearing
from you.
Fo en's lives,
