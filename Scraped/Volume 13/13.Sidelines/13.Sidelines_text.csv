twenty-five copies of something was very labor inten-

J. I wonder if it was our Gestetner.
C. Did it go to Santa Rosa?
J. I don't know where it went to. I wouldn't be sur-

C.So the bookstores left WIP with a communication
network. We had the first issue out on October 1 and
we had the money to do it because the five largest
stores — Womanbooks, New Words, A Woman's
Place and two others each donated $100 to get the
newsletter started. $100 was a lot of money at that
point in time.
J. Yes, it certainly was.
C. The money carried us until we could figure out how
much it would cost to publish 12 issues a year. We
charged $18 per year for the first couple years.
