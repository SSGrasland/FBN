Drawing the Line N hotharaply by Susan k in E lluboratton l i
by Kiss and Tell Persimmon Blackbridge and Lizard Jones)
This provocative and timely collection of forty black and white photographs
selected from the original art exhibit, explores issues of lesbian sexuality and KEZAR AREA
censorship. True to the interactive nature of the art show, each image in this post-
card book includes a range of comments from women viewers in American,
Australian, and Canadian cities, and an introduction by the artists discusses the
context of their work. Drawing the Line is an invitation for women to participate i
the dialogue. ISBN 0-88974-030-5 $10.95
Dream On by Chrystos
In her second collection of poetry, this Native American writer and activist brings a
clear-sighted realism, outrage, and wry humour to her work. These poems and
prose pieces meditate on eroticism, the long-term effects of incest, abuse within
lesbian relationships, and the genocide of Native peoples. Chrystos gives us
courageous, resiliant, and sometimes celebratory poetry motivated by the
necessity to name, and in so doing, offers an affirmation of life.

"" MONTREAL MASSACRE gynergy books
But if, in the weaving of individual existence, there
are times when forgetting is therapeutic, for women
there are times when remembering is imperative.
Louise Malette and Marie Chalouh
THE MONTREAL MASSACRE
In essays, letters and poems the voices of Quebec feminists
address the hard truth: The massacre of fourteen women at
the University of Montreal on December 6, 1989 was not the
isolated act of a madman — but the tragic consequence of
the misogyny that underscores privileges assumed by men,
and endangers all women.

Lee Fleming (editor)
“Whats the erotic? Is this a bedside book of steamy sex and masturbation stories or a collection that challenges us to
experience other lesbians’ erotic truth, or both?” The editor raised these questions — but she’s not the only one looking
for answers. We're delighted to be back to press with this satisfying anthology of short fiction and poems by 31 writers.

KATHERINE V Murder by Tradition
A Kate Delafield Mystery
NENBER NY TRARIEISR by Katherine V. Forrest
A new novel featuring the most celebrated lesbian detective
in mystery fiction from Lambda Literary Award winner
Katherine V. Forrest . .….
Young Teddie Crawford is dead from multiple stab wounds
in a restaurant kitchen awash with blood. The suspect claims
self-defense — that Teddie made a homosexual advance and
backed it up with a knife. Yet everything LAPD homicide
detective Kate Delafield learns tells her differently.
Kate tries to shield her young lover from the brutal realities
of the case. No one, especially Kate’s partner, Ed Taylor, is
anxious to aggressively pursue a case involving a dead gay man
and his gay associates. Kate’s personal stake in the trial: the
defense attorney is a man from her past — with the power to expose her private life.
Praise for The Beverly Malibu, Lambda Literary Award Winner, Best Mystery:
“Ms. Forrest’s Los Angeles homicide detective Kate Delafield makes a strong impression...for
the smartly professional but still compassionate manner in which she investigates the murder
of a crusty, elderly film director...her detective plies her trade with admirable efficiency and
more hard-to-come-by integrity.” — The New York Times Book Review

Benediction
by Diane Salvatore
One of the finest novels of this or any season ...
Grace is a junior at Immaculate Blessing Academy for Girls.
She deeply admires young Sister Mary Alice. Her best friend
is Anne, whose central topic of conversation is how far she
will go with her boyfriend. Grace dates Glen, who is thinking
of becoming a priest, and she looks up to the swaggering, self-
assured Linda Amato, star center of the basketball team.
When Grace meets the rebellious, sensuous Meg, her entire
life becomes a cauldron of powerful emotion and chaotic desire.

“LOVING THE GODDESS WITHIN: SEX
MAGICK FOR WOMEN offers a much needed
celebration of sacred sexuality and love, includ-
ing the often neglected subject of self-love.
With her unique blend of practical downto

the world around them.”—Starhawk. “A well-grounded, clear, and thoughtful book and at
the same time very useful—I, myself, found it healing.”—Susan Griffin. “I highly
recommend Margo Adair’s gentle yet penetrating meditations to all people wishing to
change their relationship with themselves, one another, and the planet.”—Hallie Iglehart
Austen. “This book contains many useful tools; all the meditations are valuable and can be
used time and time again.”—Shakti Gawain

“I 1OVe yOu,” Meg said in Grace's ear,
so quietly Grace wasn't sure what she heard. But Meg
pulled back and looked at her so intently that she knew
she wasn't mistaken. “So much,” Meg said simply.
There was no way of knowing who moved first, no way
to determine which one of them had inclined slightly forward.

Grace looks up to the swaggering, self-assured Linda Amato, star center of the champion basketball team.
Then she accidentally discovers the truth about Linda.
When Grace meets the rebellious, sensuous Meg, her entire life becomes a cauldron of powerful emotion

makes new demands and Sister Mary Alice issues a troubling moral challenge.
And Meg — what is Grace to make of Meg's ardent yet contradictory behavior? Can the intimidating,
