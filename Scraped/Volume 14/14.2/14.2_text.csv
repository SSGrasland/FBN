choices they can from what life offers.
Zeta Base
by Judith Alguire
As the galaxy celebrates a half-millennium gala, Antiquity,
Earth’s venerable science-philosopher, announces an ominous
finding about the Earth’s sun. But, esteemed though she may
be, her warning is received with skepticism — because her
theories rely entirely on the readings of outmoded instruments.
Antiquity’s three brilliant proteges are reunited: free-spirited
Morgan, daredevil performance artist; gentle Deirdre, nurturer
of Earth’s animals; and Jaffey, master engineer, whose expertise
will prove Antiquity’s findings...or will it?
Morgan and Jaffey rekindle an old rivalry over Deirdre...and
a fierce love triangle deepens amid the intrigue and danger.
Don’t miss this fascinating tale of Earth’s future.

The letter stressed the book’s demonstration of the

lesbians in lesbian literature, and the significance of

Keep a notebook at the sales counter to record the
titles for all books requested by customers that you
don’t have — either because you're out of the book or
because it’s a title you don’t carry. Such a notebook can
become a very important and useful resource for the
buyer and gives good feedback regarding sales lost by
being out-of-stock and lets you know what your
customers want that you don’t have.
Neal outlined a three step process for reducing
inventory size — whether because the inventory is
simply too big for sales, or to adjust for declining sales
in a recession.
1) Do returns.
2) Simultaneously slow down the buy: order 2
copies where you've previously ordered three. Order
one where you've ordered two. And keep an eye on

try to get it. In the Fall of 1988, Inland introduced, with
the encouragement of some women’s publishers, the
Womensource catalogue. Womensource was designed
to feature the titles of women’s presses dedicated to
publishing books by, for, and about women. These titles
include fiction, non-fiction, feminist, lesbian, women of
color, women with disabilities, health and healing, spiri-
tuality, politics, children, and so on. In general, these
titles represent the wide range of women’s experiences
while challenging current power structures and defin-
ing women’s own societal relationships. By featuring
these publishers in the Womensource catalogue, Inland 44

So, for example, if you want 1,000 or more copies,
we can reproduce at cost the content section of the
Womensource catalogue (minus the Inland informa-
tion, obviously) with a cover on which you can put
your own store name and logo. For quantities less than
1,000, we'd give you just the contents at cost. You can
then use these as handouts for your customers or as
‘addendums to your own mailings! Let us know if you
are interested so that we can better anticipate the
demand and be more specific about the cost.
Overall, Womensource provides visibility to a
growing number of quality women’s presses and titles.
Also it encourages stores trying to develop a well-
rounded women’s section with a uşable tool and clear
information. And finally, Womensource continues to

popularity? Do more lesbians in your community

Every Lesbian book, event, artifact is a celebra-

their gay “brothers”, and bi-sexual activists have been
showing up on prime time, movies, and books, books,

Wall by Kiss and Tell, is a book made up of 40 postcards
that you can remove or leave in place. The images come
from a show of the same name and are about where
you draw the censoring line in lesbian sexual images.
The images range from kissing/embracing and oral
sex at the front, through biting, bathroom sex, flagella-

male voyeurs, and bondage and are modeled by the
same couple throughout. Graphically striking and
beautifully produced, the pictures disturb me by their
dispassionate staginess. As an adult who was battered
as a child, I also recoil from the whip images and had
problems looking at the book long enough to review it.

portrayals of lesbian sexuality which are being mar-
