<p>-- letter to George Houghton Gilman, May 11, 1897</p>
<p>Charlotte Perkins Gilman is best known as the author of the short story ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" and a utopian novel, <i>Herland</i>, but she also wrote six nonfiction books and hundreds of articles and lectures. Arguably one of the most radical and certainly one of the most original thinkers of her era, Gilman (1860-1935) is missing from the male-authored intellectual histories and biographies of the period.</p>
<p>This <i>Reader</i> is an effort to fill that gap, offering a representative sample of her nonfiction writing. Presented chronologically, these selections emphasize her thoughts on gender, evolution, economics, radical political movements, and women's groups. Each chapter begins with an exploration of her life during the years covered and a discussion of contemporary intellectual, social, and political developments.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 0.55 Inches, Length: 8.89 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 5.94 Inches",17.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/73/9780231076173.jpg,Success,93.0,14.4

In Domesticity And Dirt, Phyllis Palmer Examines The Cultural Norms That Led Such Women To Take On The Ornamental And Emotional Elements Of The Job While Relegating The Hard Physical Work And Demeaning Service Tasks To Servants—mainly Women Of Color. Using Novels, Films, Magazine Articles, Home Economics Texts, And Government-funded Domestic Training Course Manuals, The Author Details Cultural Expectations About Middle-class Homelife. Palmer Describes How Government-funded Education Programs Encouraged The Divisions Of Labor And Identity And Undercut Domestic Workers’ Organized Efforts During The 1930s To Win Inclusion In New Deal Programs Regulating Labor Conditions. Aided By Less Powerful Black Civil Rights Groups, Without The Assistance Of Trade Unions Or Women’s Clubs, Domestics Failed To Win Legal Protections And The Legal Authority And Self-respect These Brought To Covered Workers. The Author Also Reveals How Middle- Class Women Responded Ambivalently To The Call To Aid Women Workers When Labor Reforms Threatened Their Domestic Arrangements. Throughout Her Study, Palmer Questions Why White Middle-class Women Looked To New Technology And Domestic Help To Deal With Cultural Demands Upon The Perfect Housewife Rather Than Expecting Their Husbands To Help. When The Supply Of Servants Declined During The 1950s, Middle-class Housewives Were Left Isolated With Lots Of Housework. Although They Rapidly Followed Their Servants Into Paid Work Outside The Home, They Remain Responsible For Housework And Child Care. In The Series Women In The Political Economy, Edited By Ronnie J.

Apter shows that contrary to the classical view of adolescence as a stage in which daughters reject their mothers, adolescent daughters often remain strongly attached to them. The strife that characterizes this period is actually the result of trying to renegotiate a valued relationship.<br><br>Beautifully written, Altered Loves explodes conventional myths and theories about mother-daughter relationships and offers new and valuable insights that will help mothers remember and daughters understand the delicate, painful, and complex process of becoming a woman.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.84 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches",19.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/16/9780449906316.jpg,Success,95.0,14.4

Brutal. Male. One Of These Stereotypes Of The Ku Klux Klan Offer A Misleading Picture. In Women Of The Klan, Sociologist Kathleen Blee Unveils An Accurate Portrait Of A Racist Movement That Appealed To Ordinary People Throughout The Country. In So Doing, She Dismantles The Popular Notion That Politically Involved Women Are Always Inspired By Pacifism, Equality, And Justice. All The Better People, A Former Klanswoman Assures Us, Were In The Klan. During The 1920s, Perhaps Half A Million White Native-born Protestant Women Joined The Women's Ku Klux Klan (wkkk). Like Their Male Counterparts, Klanswomen Held Reactionary Views On Race, Nationality, And Religion. But Their Perspectives On Gender Roles Were Often Progressive. The Klan Publicly Asserted That A Women's Order Could Safeguard Women's Suffrage And Expand Their Other Legal Rights. Privately The Wkkk Was Working To Preserve White Protestant Supremacy. Blee Draws From Extensive Archival Research And Interviews With Former Klan Members And Victims To Underscore The Complexity Of Extremist Right-wing Political Movements. Issues Of Women's Rights, She Argues, Do Not Fit Comfortably Into The Standard Dichotomies Of Progressive And Reactionary. These Need To Be Replaced By A More Complete Understanding Of How Gender Politics Are Related To The Politics Of Race, Religion, And Class. Part 1. The Klan And Womanhood.

Among its complicated implications for filmmakers was a stigmatization of film spectacle--including the display of ""Hollywood women,"" whose extravagant appearance connoted at best unpatriotic wastefulness and at worst collaboration with the enemy. Exploring the wartime breakdown of conventional gender roles on the screen and in the audience, Antonia Lant demonstrates that many British films of the period signaled their national cinematic identity by diverging from the notion of the Hollywood star, the mainstay of commercial American motion pictures, replacing her with a deglamourized, mobilized heroine. Nevertheless, the war machine demanded that British films continue to celebrate stable and reassuring gender roles. Contradictions abounded, both within film narratives and between narrative and ""real life."" Analyzing films of all the major wartime studios, the author scrutinizes the efforts of realist and melodramatic texts to confront women's wartime experiences, including conscription.
