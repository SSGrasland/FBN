By Sarah Barbara Watstein the book is written in a question-and-answer format.
AIDS is covered in a chapter on viral STDs.
In the early 1980s, women heard that they weren’t
vulnerable. We were told to relax. After all, AIDS
wasn't widespread.
Today, most women are aware that they are ex-
tremely vulnerable. Most of us know that women are
the current victims of the epidemic. Nonetheless, myths
about women and AIDS persist. These myths perpetu-
ate misleading information and half-truths. The media
continues to disperse alarms and reassurances.
The following list offers core resources on women
and AIDS. All of these titles are readily accessible. All
are timely, informative and impelled by a deep con-
cern for women’s health and women’s rights. Written
in easy-to-understand language, most contain advice
and recommendations about human sexual interac-
tions that is offered in a sensitive and positive manner.
These are books that will — if available — influence
the risks women take and the choices we make.

After he outlawed jelly beans, the Duke issued
another proclamation: “I had exactly one
mother and one father, and I turned out so well,
I think al! children should have exactly one
mother and one father. Any that don’t ... why,
we'll throw 'em in the dungeon.”
But the kids of the kingdom found a way to
stop him. Their story is one of five original and
enchanting fairy tales in this beautifully illus-

Wiles of Girlhood by Joanne Arnott
Wiles of Girlhood is narrative poetry, skillfully delving into things unthinkable. “Wiles” are, from a
young girl’s point of view, those skills and abilities, sleight of mind or hand or heart that will permit
her some degree of wholeness and strength. What emerges in Wiles of Girlhood is the courage and
tenacity of a woman who, against|many odds, has achieved and articulated an integrated, vital self.

Books For"" Matriofs
Things Happen
Poems of Survival
Emma Lou Thayne
Thayne’s poems chronicle the experiences of an elderly woman who is too
vibrant for the rest home, a parent watching the last child leave home, a neighbor
succumbing to AIDS. Thayne confronts the ephemeral experience of “travellers”
in mortality by affirming the will to live, arguing that world transformation begins
within individual lives.
Thayne is a lecturer, peace activist, and writer. She is author of How Much
for the Earth? and On Slim Unaccountable Bones.
ISBN: 0-941214-885 Cloth. 80pages. $18.95.
Only When I Laugh
Elouise Bell
“Elouise Bell’s essays are good news. Wry, wise, and entirely decent, they
savor, with healing humor, feminist, the rescue of Planet Earth by matriots, and
hometown meetings. Thinking laughter—that’s the medicine Bell serves us.”—Jo
Gillikin, Women’s Studies Quarterly
“A gentle reminder that in spite of different lifestyles and beliefs, [feminists]
do share at least a few common experiences.”—Valerie Sanders, Feminisms
Bell is a columnist for Network magazine and dean of honors education at
Brigham Young University.
ISBN: 1-56085-013-2 Paper. 130pages. $9.95.
Peculiar People
Mormons and Same-Sex Orientation
Ron Schow, Wayne Schow & Marybeth Raynes
“A Peculiar People.” The title is worn as a badge of honor by Mormon faithful,
proud of the tradition of persecution for being different. This title is ironic to lesbian
and gay Mormons who currently suffer discrimination from within and without their
church. Peculiar People chronicles their experience through survey information,
sociological data, and personal perspectives of family, friends, and clergy.
Ron Schow teaches in the College of Health-Related
Professions and Wayne Schow chairs the Department of
English and Philosophy at Idaho State University. Marybeth
Raynes is a licensed clinical therapist.

Magazines
We were excited to finally see a copy of Empathy,
An Interdisciplinary Journal for Persons Working to
End Oppression on the Basis of Sexual Identities, a
promising magazine exploring the causes of, manifes-
tations of and antidotes to homophobia. The journal,
published twice a year by the Gay and Lesbian Advo-
cacy Research Project along with The Campaign to
End Homophobia, is packed with essays, prose and
poetry, research reports, reviews and photography, all
divided into sections: media, oppressions, reflections,
family, schools, challenging our thinking, interna-
tional, military, religion and spirituality, reviews and
resources, and poetry. The issue we saw (Volume 2,
Number 2), while not necessarily beautiful to look at
(has desk-top published stamped on it) was beautiful
to read. Voices varied by class, race and age, and
thoughtful articles covered topics including films in
the AIDS era, reflections on race and sexuality, strate-
gies to defeat anti-gay referenda, the story of a gay
man in AA, coming out to children and talking about
donor insemination, a survey of lesbian and gay col-

tion from her parents who were overwhelmed by her
sister’s disability. We also see Sally in periods when
she is stabilized on medication and making strides
toward independence and when she is marked by

close friend.
The Now Women and the Old Men: Love, Sex
and the Woman Question by Ruth Brandon ($12.95
pb, 0393308111, 2/92) is a portrait of an extraordinary
group of men and women at the turn of the century in
England. This group of progressive thinkers included
Havelock Ellis, Olive Schreiner, Eleanor Marx, Sidney
and Beatrice Webb, Margaret Sanger and H. G. Wells.
Brandon examines the gulf between their principles
and practice, particularly in their marriages and sex-
ual relationships.

book If You Love This Planet ($10.95 pb, 0393308359,
