Gwen Raverat, the granddaughter of Charles Darwin, described this memoir of her late Victorian Cambridge childhood as a drawing of the world when I was young. The observations of the small incidents in her life and of her eccentric Darwin family, recorded here in her inimitably charming prose reveal an artist's careful eye. Vividly evoking a bygone era, it is a shrewd, touching and comic portrait of her childhood, her eccentric relations, and of Cambridge academic society.

But movie audiences did not know that nearly a third of her powerful screenplay had been cut. This edition restores all of these deletions and delivers the screenplay that is true to Hansberry's vision.</p> <h3>Sacred Fire</h3> <p><I>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, written by the then twenty-nine-year-old Hansberry, was the ""movin on up"" morality play of the 1960s. Martin had mesmerized millions, and integration was seen as the stairway to heaven. Raisin had something for everyone, and for this reason it was the recipient of the prestigious New York Drama Critics Circle Award.<p> The place: a tenement flat in Southside, Chicago. The time: post World War II. Lena Younger, the strong-willed matriarch, is the glue that holds together the Younger family. Walter Lee is her married, thirty-something son who, along with his wife and sister, lives in his mother s apartment. He is short on meeting responsibilities but long on dreams. Beneatha (that s right, Beneatha) is Waiter s sister an upwardly mobile college student who plans to attend medical school.<p> Mama Lena is due a check from her late husband s insurance, and Waiter Lee is ready to invest it in a liquor store. The money represents his opportunity to assert his manhood. It will bring the jump start he needs to set his life right. Beneatha tells him that it s ""mama s money to do with as she pleases,"" and that she doesn t really expect any for her schooling. However, Mama wants to use her new money for a new beginning in a new house, in a new neighborhood (white).<p> Walter cries, and Mama relents. She refrains from paying cash for the house and places a deposit instead, giving Waiter the difference to share equally between his investment and Beneatha s college fund. Walter squanders the entire amount. Meanwhile, Mama receives a call from the neighborhood ""welcome committee"" hoping to dissuade the family from moving in.<p> While roundly criticized for being politically accommodating to whites, <i>Raisin</i> accurately reflected the aspirations of a newly nascent black middle class.</p>",en,8th printing,"Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.33 Inches, Weight: 2.20462262 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/63/9780452267763.jpg,Success,107.0,14.5

Their emphasis on dreams, automatic writing, and the unconscious reveal some of the least inhibited masculine fantasies. The first resistance to the male surrealists' projection of the female figure arose in the writings and paintings of marginalized woman artists and writers associated with Surrealism. The essays in this collection explore the complexity of these women's works, which simultaneously employ and subvert the dominant discourse of male surrealists.Mary Ann Caws is Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

Barney received in her home such literary, artistic, musical and intellectual beacons of the 20th century as James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Colette, Isadora Duncan, Auguste Rodin, Romaine Brooks, William Carlos Williams, Paul Valery, Renee Vivian, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Truman Capote. In 1929, she shared her life, in and out of the salon, through the publication of the first of three volumes of reminiscences. Here Barney explores her family tree, chronicles her friendships and associations through reprinted correspondence and recreated conversations, and evokes the golden age of her salon in a gallery of literary portraits. The first half of the volume features a baker's dozen of the male writers she kneow, from Oscar Wilde, whom she literally ran into at the age of five, to Pierre Louys, who encouraged her fledgling writing career and Paul Valery, an ""Immortal"" in the Academie Francaise. Barney dedicated the latter half of her diary to the Academie des Femmes, which she founded in 1927, as a counterpart to the male bastion of the French Academy. The book preserves the proceedings of meetings between such figures as Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, Colette, Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes and Mina Loy, in the distinctive voices of their speakers.",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.87964442538 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",89.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/74/9780814711774.jpg,Success,58.0,14.5

Just as women have to overcome the patriarchal tyrant in their own souls, men have to liberate and differentiate their inner femininity. Only then will a better relationship of the sexes be possible."" It is this timely theme that Dr. von Franz explores in her psychological study of a classic work of the second century, The Golden Assby Apuleius of Madaura. The novel recounts the adventures of a young Roman who is transformed into an ass and eventually finds spiritual renewal through initiation into the Isis mysteries. With its many tales within a tale (including the celebrated story of Psyche and Eros), the text as interpreted by Dr. von Franz is a rich source of insights, anecdotes, and scholarly amplification.",en,"Revised, Expanded, Subsequent","Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.76720867176 pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/36/9780877735236.jpg,Success,111.0,14.5

—Gloria Feman Orenstein, University of Southern California, author of <i>The Reflowering of the Goddess</i></p>
<p>Alongside the boom in feminist and lesbian scholarship and activism of the last twenty years, there has evolved a distinctive spiritual tradition focused on and revolving around women. This spirituality finds its roots in a number of different traditions, including the Native American, African American, and Euro American traditions. Central to these disparate traditions is the focus on a goddess figure, the centrality of the female principle, and the mending of the separation between mind and body.</p>
<p>Weaving the strands of women's spirituality from different cultures together, Annette van Dyke here addresses the commonalities among these rich traditions. Examining the work and writings of such figures as Leslie Marmon Silko, Paula Gunn Allen, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Starhawk, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Sonia Johnson, and Mary Daly, Van Dyke illustrates how these writers and activists outline a journey toward wholeness - a ""curing ceremony"" - that allows them to reclaim their spirituality from the deadening influence of patriarchal religions. Taken together, their work contributes to a vision of a world based on a female principle, one which exemplifies a lesbian-feminist ethic.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 0.63052206932 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/00/9780814787700.jpg,Success,58.0,14.5
