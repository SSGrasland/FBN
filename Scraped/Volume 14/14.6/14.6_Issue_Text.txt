Dear Mr. Gilson,
We are in receipt of your letter dated 24 October

gauntlet with the crack about “unwholesome associa-

BARE AS THE TREES — Known for her clarity and directness, Elkind has earned national recogni-

well as the joy.

a daily basis, etc. It was really horrible for months. We
were very afraid and with good reason.
We had a lot of contact with the local police who
were very supportive but could never arrive quickly
enough to catch them at it. And anyway, it was hard
to impress on them how intimidating it is to be called
“a f...... lesbian” every day. All the other shops in the
Orange Grove Plaza were also intimidated and re-
peatedly broken into, but of course we got the special
treatment.
We had meetings with the police, with all the
other shopkeepers, and with local residents who were
also fed up with this gang. Old women were afraid to
be on the streets after dark and a number of young
girls had been raped.
A group of our loyal and wonderful customers
became very concerned and called a meeting to sup-
port us and to decide what we could do, and what
they could do to help. About 60 women came to that
first meeting, and a number of strategies were
planned. These included a letter writing campaign to
the police chief, to the local council and member of
parliament demanding action, a roster system espe-
cially on weekends so that there would always be
women in and around the shop in case of an attack.
Other women took photographs of the boys so we
could identify them. We also had discussions with
community conflict resolution people in the hope of
resolving things in a peaceful way with the boys. We
also decided that no one would respond aggressively
or violently to the boys. Another group held a beauti-
ful ritual for us and around us. We chanted and
drummed and affirmed that the problem would be
dealt with, that we would all be safe, and that the boys
would leave us alone. This was very empowering and
also made us feel loved and appreciated. Two other
dear women came to the shop and did a private pro-

The task of feminism is naming and confronting
oppression whether the domination and subordina-

class, age, looks, ableness, or any of the multitude of
ways patriarchy is maintained by creating false sub-

tion of other oppressions with sexism in their lives,
feminism has challenged the multitude of ways
women, and others, are oppressed. For this, feminists
have been derided as “politically correct,” the arche-

deny the pain of oppressions experienced by other
women, but to which we are not subject...yet. Thus

feminist circles have called other feminists to account

will change. Oppression is not ended by calling its Using “accessibility” as a politically charged term

Tree: Deena Metzger’s powerful account of her struggle with cancer—
and her victory. DEENA METZGER
The Woman Who Slept With Men to Take the War Out of Them:
a novel in dramatic form of woman and man, peace and war. TREE
With rich and evocative language, Deena Metzger plays on an old myth
to explore the dilemma of male and female and the conflict between
masculine and feminine values. This is a moving book, one that brings
us closer to the truths we need to survive.—Susan Griffin <
A very personal, moving, and exhilarating story of a woman’s struggle
with cancer and with the darker forces within her own psyche. This
attempt to recreate “maps for healing” will prove inspiring to all those
who are suffering from illness and attempting to participate in their own
healing.—Stephanie Matthews-Simonton & THE WOMAN WHO
