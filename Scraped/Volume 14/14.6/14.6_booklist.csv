Alcala understands the necessary understatement of magical realism. In one tale, a mild archbishop leaps off a balcony on impulse and soars above the village, waving to those below. He is particularly pleased that no one can smell his foul body odor from the distance. Many of the stories are mysteries of sorts, pivoting on unexpected, ironic turns of events yet moving methodically toward resolution. A fortune teller reveals the immediate future to a wild young man. ``You are going very fast . . . with a powerful man, a dangerous man . . . holding you against your will.'' When the youth angrily demands his money back, the police are called, drugs are discovered and the prophecy comes true. Other stories describe family traumas: a wife mistakes her husband's lust for gold for an affair with another woman; one of two elderly sisters visits with the dead and spends leisurely hours in purgatory. This is Alcala's first book, by turns touching, entertaining and surprising, and uniquely her own.

In the process, she discovers the mainsprings of strength within herself as she follows her own drummer, finding the courage to face the darkest and most secret convolutions of her own mind. She weaves the story of her journey through the men, women, and children she meets, and the dangers and adventures she faces as a lone woman traveler--part and parcel of the path she has chosen to take.<p>She infuses readers at any stage of life, especially women, with the courage to do what their individual drummer dictates, as she did, to find fulfillment in life. Lightfoot-Klein assures readers in her book&#58; &#8220;Even a life of quiet desperation is not beyond redemption. Change starts with a reassessment of the distortions in self image one has been programmed to accept. It starts with an inner rebellion, a realization that something has been amiss and a desire to set it right, if only to leave a better heritage for one&rsquo;s children. And then, most important of all, it begins with a single, wild, breathless moment, where one picks up an unaccustomed load and steps off into the unknown . . . &#8221; Her message is truly for everyone.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>More about the author than about Africa, this unusual memoir tells of a woman who regenerates herself in midlife through three yearlong solo backpacking trips. Though the narrative is disorganized and the writing sometimes cliched, the story is often absorbing because the author is so intrepid. A burnt-out English teacher in a ``nightmare'' New York City high school, Lightfoot-Klein, with her children grown, her marriage disintegrating and her lingering health problems resolved, decided at 51 to trek through Africa. While in Sudan, she learned of the barbaric but widespread African custom of female genital excision; obsessed with the story and proud to meet the challenge of life in Sudan, she returned to work on her first book, Prisoners of Ritual: An Odyssey into Female Circumcision in Africa . She intersperses chapters on her background, including a particularly warped family and an invented Native American grandfather, with African adventures both inspiring and cautionary: dealing with the bureaucracy, finding lodgings at police stations, having sexual escapades, eating raw camel's liver and being raped if this happened to author; if not, stet on the beach in Kenya.

As Natalie Robins Reveals For The First Time, This Assault On Freedom Of Expression Began Long Before Iron-fisted J. Edgar Hoover Joined The Justice Department And Made His Name Synonymous With That Of The Fbi For Over Forty Years. The War Carried Over Into The 1980s, When Librarians, As Part. Of A Library Awareness Program, Were Recruited To Spy On Readers. Drawing On Nearly 150 Files Released To The Author Under The Freedom Of Information Act, Natalie Robins's Absorbing Narrative Offers Compelling New Documentary Evidence About The Hounding And Intimidation Of Writers Ranging From John Reed To Allen Ginsberg, From Edna St. Vincent Millay To James Baldwin, And From Walter Winchell To Robert Lowell--a Virtual Who's Who Of American Letters. Alien Ink Is The. Story Of Hidden Agendas And Hidden Powers, And Contains Many Surprises--among Them, That Hoover, Known For His Right-wing Sympathies, Not Only Inhibited Left-wing Expression, But Harassed Right-wingers As Well. Robins Shows How The Bureau Combed Newspapers, Books, Plays, Films, And Radio Broadcasts For Alien Ink--anything Anti-american Or Anti-fbi--and Describes How Those Incriminated Endured Phone Taps, Mail Searches, And Character Assassinations. She Reveals The. Pressure Tactics Fbi Agents Employed To Make Them Toe The Line, As Well As The Astounding Criminal Lengths (including Extortion And Entrapment) That The Bureau Went To In Order To Get Something On Those Writers Who Wouldn't Capitulate. And She Explains The Fbi's Attitude Toward The Group Of Writers It Considered The Most Threatening Of All: Journalists. Confirming Robins's Findings Are Dozens Of Interviews--dramatic Dialogues--with Living Writers And Others Of All. Ideological Persuasions, Who Bear Witness To The Fbi's Investigative Crusade. They Include Norman Mailer, William F. Buckley, Jr., Murray Kempton, Arthur Miller, Kay Boyle, Jessica Mitford, And Howard Fast.

0-688-09471-6,Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in Their Struggle for Self,"Golomb, Elan",William Morrow & Co,271.0,1992,,Hardcover,"In this compelling book, Elan Golomb identifies the crux of the emotional and psychological problems of millions of adults. Simply put, the children of narcissist — offspring of parents whose interest always towered above the most basic needs of their sons and daughters — share a common belief: They believe they do not have the right to exist. The difficulties experienced by adult children of narcissists can manifest themselves in many ways: for examples, physical self-loathing that takes form of overeating, anorexia, or bulimia; a self-destructive streak that causes poor job performance and rocky personal relationships; or a struggle with the self that is perpetuated in the adult's interaction with his or her own children. These dilemmas are both common and correctable, Dr. Golomb tells us. With an empathic blend of scholarship and case studies, along with her own personal narrative of her fight for self, Dr. Golomb plumbs the depths of this problem, revealing its mysterious hold on the affairs of otherwise bright, aware, motivated, and worthy people. <i>Trapped in the Mirror</i> explores.the nature of the paralysis and lack of motivation so many adults feelstress and its role in exacerbating childhood wrongswhy do many of our relationships seem to be ""reruns"" of the past how one's body image can be formed by faulty parenting how anger must be acknowledge to be overcomeand, most important, how even the most traumatized self can be healed.Rooted in a profoundly humanist traditional approach, and suffused with the benefit of the latest knowledge about intrafamily relationships, <i>Trapped in the Mirror</i> offers more than the average self-help book; it is truly thefirst self-heal book for millions.

                        <p>Narcissists are people who believe themselves to be the center of the universe, with the people around them merely servants. These parents view their children as only extensions of themselves, and are unable to see their children as individuals. Golomb reveals that the adult child's ultimate goal is the development of strength to free themselves from their parents.

She has succeeded in remaining true to herself in a stubborn struggle against powerful conformist pressures. Yet her resistance is largely passive. Self-absorbed, indecisive, she makes her own uncharted way through life, letting her husband, lovers, even her only daughter, gradually slip away. Signs that she is pregnant after a casual affair rouse her to make decisions. Then a deeply ironic turn of events thrusts her into the cold light of a reluctant self-knowledge. Through layer upon layer of dreams, memories, defenses, and delusions, she emerges finally to take a conscious step toward the independence she cannot yet define, certain only that she herself has changed. 
<p>In <i>Child of Fortune</i>, Yuko Tsushima has brought to life a woman whose psychological complexity reflects the meeting of Japanese fiction and women's changing consciousness. The depths of inner conflict are illuminated here by radiant imagery, wry humor, and a sharp clarity of vision.</p>
<p>While drawing on the ""I-novel"" tradition that has dominated modern Japanese literature, the author integrates the autobiographical elements into a fully realized fictional work of penetrating social insight.</p>
<p>The novel received the 1978 Women's Literature Prize, one of many awards that have spotlighted Yuko Tsushima as a writer of exceptional gifts.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/42/9784770015242.jpg,Success,76.0,14.6

No other book has spelled out so clearly the parallels between sex and eating nor integrated the relationship of these to women’s basic need to be loved.</p>
<p>Today’s dilemma for women—be fat or go hungry—and the endless variations and unsatisfying solutions to this problem have contributed to the incidence of anorexia, bulimia, and obesity. The pursuit of slimness, the obsession with having the perfect body, excessive aerobicizing, and diet books ad nauseam are all part of this phenomenon. Authors in <b>Women’s Conflicts About Eating and Sexuality</b> skillfully discuss the parallel between women’s obsession with sex and romance in the fifties and their obsession with food today. An important book for all women, it sheds light on the complex issues facing women and devotes special attention to the career woman and the additional pressures to be slim and stay slim.</p>
<p>The woman who reads this potentially life-changing book can examine, question, and change her behavior, using the specific step-by-step program aid included in the book. This book is for every woman who has ever worried about being too fat or too sexual. <b>Women’s Conflicts About Eating and Sexuality</b> will appeal to women of all ages—young women and their mothers will be fascinated by the parallels between sexual obsessions of thirty years ago and the eating obsessions of today.</p>
<p>This healing book will particularly attract single career women for whom sex and relationships are fraught with complications. Counselors and therapists will find this book an excellent resource in their work with helping women. It is also a good auxiliary text for courses in Women’s Studies focusing on psychology and history of women and the sociology of women and eating disorders.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.35 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.8598028218 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches",26.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/82/9780918393982.jpg,Success,99.0,14.6

Janice Thom and Kevin Engel provide an updated bibliography. </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>From <i>The Book of Repulsive Women </i>to <i>The Antiphon, </i>Barnes challenged old gender dichotomies as she shaped radical sociopolitical views. Her textual methods celebrated a multiplicity of voices, heterodox forms, and genres, transgressing those tenets of modernism that privilege the &#8220;high art&#8221; of a single, unified textual identity or a discrete discourse. These essays offer various critical approaches and sinuous readings of the full range of Barnes&#8217; achievement. Interwoven through the essays and reminiscences is a lively commentary from Barnes&#8217; friends and contemporaries as well as Barnes herself. </P></p><h3>Booknews</h3><p>Seventeen essayists study this enigmatic author's works--not in the traditional style in which they were first reviewed, but rather through a range of contemporary interpretations that resituate Barnes in the context of literary theory and feminist revisions of modernism.
