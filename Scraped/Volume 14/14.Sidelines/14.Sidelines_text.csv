Two Collections
Compiled by Sandi Torkildson and Carol Seajay
Every year there are more calendars from which to
choose. Since we all have limited space we must pick the best
of the lot. I will give a quick overview of what is coming from
some of the trade publishers. This is a very incomplete list
and is only intended to highlight the best of the calendars.
—ST
Inspired by Sandi's “best of the trade press” collection
of calendars, I began a list of feminist-published calendars.
As always, this is just a working document. Many more
calendars will show up over the next couple of months (this
list was compiled in early August) and we'll cover more
calendars in the next issues as we receive them. —CS

death. She remained at home during the course of her
brief illness, as she wished to do.
