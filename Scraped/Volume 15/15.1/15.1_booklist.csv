Shelton describes changes in women's and men's use of time and analyzes the factors associated with these patterns. Based on national survey data, this study focuses on gender differences in time given to household labor, paid labor, and leisure, and assesses the impact of personal characteristics and structural determinants on time use. While popular opinion holds that the roles of men and women have converged, Shelton concludes that important differences remain in their use of time.</p>
<p>The author begins by overviewing the available research on gender differences and time use. She then outlines her research methodology and analyzes the roles of women and men in the labor force. Shelton next examines changing trends in household labor and gender differences in leisure activities. The concluding chapter interprets her empirical findings and suggests the extent to which time use patterns can be placed within a larger context. Anyone interested in the sociology of gender will find this study enlightening.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.87523518014 Pounds, Width: 0.499999 Inches",69.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/29/9780313265129.jpg,Success,98.0,15.1

Reclaiming The Mainstream Points Out That The Most Enduring Voices In The Women's Movement--the Voices That Each Successive Generation Of Feminists Rediscovers With A Shock Of Recognition--mary Wollstonecraft, Margaret Fuller, John Stuart Mill, Charlotte Perkins Gilman--have Spoken Out Against Government Privileges And Special Protection For Women So That Their Individual Differences Might Flourish. This Book Argues That Modern Feminism Grew Out Of The Nineteenth-century Woman Movement, Which, Like Much Late Nineteenth-century Thinking, Became A Battleground Between Individualist And Collectivist Ideas.^ When Individualist Ideals Predominated In This Movement--ideals Of Independence, Social Mobility, Even Sexual Freedom--it Gained Wide Adherence. But When The Movement Supported Collectivist Ideas Of Social Reform, It Became More Marginal And Sectarian. It Was A Focus On The Individual Woman's Rights And Happiness That Reinvented Feminist Movements Twice In Our History, In The Decades From 1910 To The New Deal, And Then Again In The Late 1960s. The Book Examines This History, Gives An Overview Of The Contemporary Scene, And Analyzes The Campaign To Pass And Ratify An Equal Rights Amendment--and Its Failure. Reclaiming The Mainstream Also Discusses Contemporary Policy Issues That Affect Women: Affirmative Action And Comparable Worth; Rape, Battering, Sexual Harassment, And Incest; The Many Facets Of Sexual And Reproductive Choice; And The Attempts To Unify Feminist And Nonfeminist Women Against Pornography Or In Support Of Social Feminist Issues.^ On All These Topics, Taylor Offers A New And Surprising Individualist Feminist Analysis That Asks Feminists To Make Their Philosophy More Consistent--and More Effective. She Calls Attention To The Continuing Voices Within The Feminist Tradition That Encourage Women To Reclaim Their Strength, Their Faith In Their Own Abilities, And The Community Feeling Of The Seventies To Find Nongovernmental Solutions To The Problems Women Still Face In Managing Work, Family Life, And Relationships.

A Documentary Filmmaker, Lloyd Goes To Italy To Find Her Roots, Winding Up In Sicily, Where She Is Welcomed By The Townspeople Of Trapani. Lloyd Observes That The Easter Week Procession Focuses Not On Jesus But On The ``powerful Though Sorrowful Madonna.'' Seeing Hints Of Her Grandmother In That Portrayal, She Investigates The ``long-suffering Nature Of Italian Women's Lives.'' Musing On History And Mythology, She Finds Links Between That Madonna And Sicily's Ancient Fertility Goddess, Demeter.

She Learns More From Clara, An Intellectual And Restaurateur, And From The Women Of San Biago, Who Organize Their Own Easter Tradition. Back In Trapani, Lloyd Joins The Male-dominated Procession, Feeling That Through Her The Goddess ``had Rejoined The World Of Men.''

0-271-00761-3,Forms of the Goddess Lajjā Gaurī in Indian Art (College Art Association Monograph),"Bolon, Carol Radcliffe",Penn State University Press,178.0,1992-03-02,,Hardcover,"<p>Striking images of a certain Indian goddess have been variously referred to as the ""shameless woman"" the ""nude squatting goddess,"" the ""mother goddess,"" or, because her historical name remains unknown, more than twenty-five names, among them Aditi, Lajjā Gaurī, Renukā, and Nagna Kabambdha. The best-known images of this goddess have a female torso and a lotus flower in place of a head, while her legs are bent up at the knees and drawn up to each side in a position that has been described as one of ""giving birth"" or ""self-display."" This type of goddess figure is explained as part of a long, highly sophisticated tradition of expressing fertility and well-being in Indian art.</p>
<p>The artists creating images of Lajjā Gaurī drew on various ancient symbols of fortune, fertility, and life-force to communicate her power through their rich heritage of meanings. As these historical-religious symbols and images were constantly reused and reincorporated, they formed a new and enriched religious context. In the process of recycling they became empowered cultural metaphors, visual morphemes in the language of Indian art.</p>
<p>Because there are no texts to explain the figure, the study proceeds from the basis of the objects to derive their meaning. Carol Bolon charts the changes in the goddess's form over a period of more than four centuries, including its possible adoption from tribal worship into Hindu temples, and brings a new appreciation of Lajjā Gaurī's rich symbolic meanings and cultural context.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 2.2 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",96.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/18/9780271007618.jpg,Success,62.0,15.1

The plays, written between the years 1986 and 1991, have been performed or read in theaters across the United States. Questioned in the six plays are the traditions so deeply rooted in the familial culture of which these playwrights are still a part, and equally explored is their need to reinterpret the inherited customs for a new identity in their present bicultural existence. These playwrights battle the myths and stereotypes that continue to circumscribe the freedom of expression and life fulfillment for Hispanic women. Their plays, indeed, shatter myths and in so doing, are creating a broader, freer space for women's identity and cultural development. Compiled by renowned playwright Denise Chavez, the anthology contains: Simply Maria, or The American Dream, by Josefina Lopez; A Dream of Canaries, by Diana Saenz; Shadow of a Man, by Cherrie Moraga; Gleaning/Rebusca, by Caridad Svich; My Visits with MGM, by Edit Villarreal; and Miriam's Flowers, by Migdalia Cruz.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.82 Inches, Weight: 0.83 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches",0.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/15/9781558850415.jpg,Success,95.0,15.1
