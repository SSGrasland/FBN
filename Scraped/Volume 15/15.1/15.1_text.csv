“IN THE HOUSE OF REAL LOVE, CARLA TOMASO TAKES AN IRREVERENT LOOK AT THE ATTITUDES AND
ISSUES THAT AFFECT LESBIAN RELATIONSHIPS. A TRUE LESBIAN FARCE.”
—HNiIsa DONNELLY, AUTHOR OF THE BAR STORIES
“HIGHLY ORIGINAL CHARACTERS...ALL OF TOMASO’S N—ARR A TOPRSU TABKE L GRIESATH EMEOTRIONSAL R ISWKS.”EEKLY
(ON Tomaso's STORIES IN VOYAGES OUT 1)
This gleefully irreverent novel is the story of a woman who loves her girlfriend Connie very
much-in fact, they've been together for 20 years. But Our unnamed, all-too-human narrator has
one bad habit she just can't break; a little matter of casual affairs from time to time to time. And
when Connie finds out, their home life takes a decidedly dramatic and outrageously offbeat
turn. Wildly comic yet astonishingly perceptive, this antic tale will make you think twice about
what goes into a “relationship that works.” Turns out it's a lot more than you might suppose.

Publishing: favor chains and superstores.
Multi-level pricing is the main reason for sequen-
tial release of hardcover and softcover formats. It is an
attempt to gain a premium from people who need the
information or want the information. This process
delays dissemination of information and depreciates
stock. Books expire because after their return date,
they are no longer good for credit at the distributor or
publisher, and their value is destroyed by dumping
(remaindering). This practice is actually contrary to
the industry's avowed purpose to disseminate infor-

The organizers of Flight of the Mind writing work-
shops are creating something very special in the forests
of Oregon: Soapstone, a writing retreat for women.
Soapstone is 24-acres of cedar, maple and alder
trees in Oregon's Coast Range, an hour and a half from
Portland. The property includes “a mile of magical
creek” and a cabin, and is home to deer, elk and beaver.
The retreat will operate six months out of the year to
provide women writers with the peace and support
they need to work. Each woman will have a private
sleeping and work space, with a shared kitchen and
living room. The cabin will be heated with a wood
stove, there will be a wood cookstove in the kitchen
and electricity for typewriters or Word processors.
Initially, Soapstone will offer residencies to two
women writers at a time, for periods of between one
week and one month. Organizers hope to eventually
build more studios at Soapstone to accommodate ad-
ditional writers. To apply, writers must submit sam-
ples of their work and information about their To make this retreat a reality, Soapstone needs

28,"The Poetry of Sex: Lesbians Write the Erotic presents a
diverse group of women writing multi-layered poems. With
a fierce honesty, seventy-eight women share their
knowledge of sexual pleasure, humor, the loss of desire,
body memories, politics, self-sexuality, separation,
fantasy, and lust. Michelle PFarkerson speaks for many
contributors when she says, “Giving voice to the erotic in
my writing is a way of celebrating why | am a lesbian —
the force and transcendence of women’s passions. In a
society that thrives on pornography, racism, and
homophobia, there is defiance in shaping a sexual
universe in my own image.”

it has a lot of diversity. We wanted a place where
people would feel free to come in and browse or sit
while their children played with toys.”
With the assistance of quite a few volunteers who
helped build bookshelves, paint walls and build a
stage for concerts, the 800- square-foot store opened in
September 1990 in a space that had previously served
as a laundry, antique store and winery.
Scarborough's background in biochemistry sug-
gested the name Meristem, which literally is the cells of
a plant that carry its memory and enable it to regenerate.

mainstay of their business, and the store’s fastest-grow-
ing areas have been women’s spirituality, including
earth-based religions and the goddess movement and
mysteries by and about women, Scarborough says.
However, in the past year, jewelry and music also
have been a major part of the store's success and their
non-book inventory has also doubled. While books
represented about 60% of their sales, jewelry ac-
counted for about 18%.
The store also offers a variety of women’s music
from small independent labels that is not as readily
available elsewhere, and music sales account for about
17% of the store's business.
“We try to connect with major artists and, if we
can afford them, bring them up to Memphis. We plan
the concert, set up the sound system, sell tickets, do
just about everything,” Scarborough says. “We do
women’s music because women need a place to per-
form and women want to hear them.”

Store newsletters... they take time; they cost money. ADBBOLAOU UCBKTLE MW S OOT TIMT HEC ENH R : S WRITE
Sending them out on a regular basis is difficult. Meas-
uring their return is impossible.
Yet, women’s communities often rely on them and
customers always love them.
Still, is publishing a newsletter worth the time and
energy? Six women’s bookstores respond with a re-
sounding, if fatigued, “yes!”
ClaireLight, Santa Rosa
“It’s a lot of work, but it’s the best thing you can do,”
says Claire Sapiro about the newsletter she’s pub-
lished regularly since ClaireLight opened six years
ago. 7O

Two to four times a year, the store contacts 1,800
customers with a printed piece, ranging in size from a
simple postcard to a four-page newsletter. A personal
letter, a bestseller list, squibs about books, and most
importantly, event information, fill each issue.

New Women’s Books from Papier-Mache Press
Sue Doro, for thirteen years the only female machinist at the former Milwaukee
Road Railway is one of countless victims of widespread American plant closings.
In this powerful collection of poetry and essays, she speaks not only to the thou-
sands of workers who are subject to the devastating effects of these closings, but
also to all women who are forced to deal with gender issues at their place of em-
ployment. This book is not just for women who work nontraditional jobs—it is
for every woman who works.
We do not know if the author is an industrial worker with a writer’s sensibility, or a
poet who works in industry. And that’s the way it should be: the authentic blend of shoulder and heart, experience
and vision. Rarely are we given such a gift. —Margaret Randall
Sue Doro writes.. .of the lives of workers and women at work, their double duties, their rich and often humorous
wealth of experience we have been robbed of. —Meridel Le Sueur

Banshee’s Women, CAPSIZED in the Coral Sea
by Jeannine Talley
True-life adventure of two experienced American cruising women
whose 34-foot sailboatis capsized and dismasted in a terrible storm off
the east coast of Australia. Joy Smith, one of the women, is injured in
the roll-over and she and Jeannine Talley call for rescue. After four
days of being helplessly tossed about, they are found and rescued first
by a cargo ship and then by helicopters flown out from Australia, 450
miles away. The women are forced to abandon their boat, Banshee, in
mid-Pacific. But the story doesn’t end there. Two intrepid Australian
sailors, learning of the women’s fate, volunteer to go out searching for
the Banshee in their 63-foot motor vessel. They find and tow the
Banshee back to Australia and generously return the boat to her two
owners without claiming a salvage fee.

Homophobia and heterosexism are different. Ho-

sexuality is superior to homosexuality. Case in point:

This issue's From Our Own Presses column begins
with a few FBN-written annotations and then continues in
its new format of “notes” from feminist publishers to femi-
nist booksellers describing their new titles, why they chose
to publish these particular books, and what makes these
books particularly important and interesting. —CS
On October 11, 1991, Anita Hill testified before
the Senate Judiciary Committee. On October 15th, the
Senate ignored her testimony and confirmed Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court. On November 17,
1,603 Black women fought back with ads in the New
York Times and six Black newspapers protesting the
confirmation, declaring “We pledge ourselves to con-
tinue to speak out in defense of one another, in defense
of the African-American community and against
those who are hostile to social justice no matter what
color they are. No one will speak for us but ourselves.”
The ad was signed by all 1,603 women. Copies of the
ad were photocopied and photocopied again and
posted in women’s bookstores, offices, workplaces,
and everywhere that outraged women gather. This ad
marked a historic moment in Black feminist organiz-
ing. To commemorate the event, Kitchen Table:

izing in books for and by women. Their priority is
creating books that promote women’s physical and
mental health, economic development and spiritual
empowerment. Their first book is Head & Heart: A
Woman’s Guide to Financial Independence by Susan
Weidman Schneider, Arthur B.C. Drache, and Helene
Brezinsky, which was originally published in Canada

and updated for the U.S. market. Head & Heart pro-

many financial situations women encounter, from
venturing out into the world of work as a young
woman to planning for retirement. The fundamental
financial education is laced with stories about real-life
women dealing with tangled emotional/financial

shared feminist viewpoint produce a book that takes finan-
cial independence for women very seriously.” — Booklist.

know and respect the central core of another’s being

LE UO Buffalo by Sydney Blair ($9 pb, 0140143548) is a
first novel about a Vietnam vet, Ray McCreary who at
40 has decided to settle down, marry, and havea child.
Yes, Sydney is a woman writing about a man and from
what my rep tells me, very well. Ray sets out on a
journey to tie up the ends of his frayed life and a quest
for what he might be missing or what he might want
to give up. Blair has an eye for the violence of men who
never find their place and the effects of war. She shows
us the despair of some vets.and the slow healing of
others.

127,"From the critically acclaimed, bestselling author of Benediction,
Lambda Award-nominee Diane Salvatore...
(A a novel by
Diane Salvatore
Certain to be the most talked-about novel of the nineties — for both
its stellar quality and its extraordinary theme.
For young Joyce Ecco, walking into a particular New York hotel room
overlooking Central Park is pure wish-fulfillment. She has been granted
an interview with Zena Beth Frazer, the most famous — and notorious
— lesbian writer in America. Notorious not just for the legendary pioneering
vision of her work but for her sexy attractiveness, her outrageous wit, her
in-your-face aplomb with the nation’s media. Not to mention her sensational
affair with a world-famous woman sports star.
The interview leads to another encounter with Zena Beth — this one
the fulfillment of Joyce’s every erotic fantasy. Soon she is invited to the
lesbian writer's home in the South. But if she joins Zena Beth, the price
will be immense: her relationship with lover Elaine, and a promising career
as a journalist in the dynamic world of New York publishing.
Will she pay the price? Would you?
You will fully share Joyce's fascination with Zena Beth Frazer. For the
portrait of Zena Beth holds back nothing. Dazzling in its erotic dimension,
substantial and detailed in all of its ramifications, this superb novel will
bring you a new perception of what it is like to be with a woman enthroned
at the very height of fame.
