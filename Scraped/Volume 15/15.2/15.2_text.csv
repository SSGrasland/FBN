2,"MORTON RIVER VALLEY
BY LEE LYNCH
From Toothpick House to Dusty’s Queen of
Hearts Diner . . . Lee Lynch has given us our
most heart-touching stories of lesbian life.
Join her now in Morton River Valley . . . and
meet new friends (and a few familiar ones)
in a story sure to win your heart all over again.
Paris Collins — named for the city where she was conceived — changes teaching jobs every
two years. Invariably she leaves behind an astonished lover who simply couldn’t believe Paris’s
warnings that she would move on.
Now Paris is in the troubled New England hamlet of Morton River Valley. Here she meets
Peg — whose sexy butch ways captivate her.
Paris finds herself embroiled in Morton River controversies — an environmentally destructive
real estate proposal, and drastic budget cuts in the Valley’s social programs. And she becomes
entangled in the Scala family: with stubborn matriarch Sophia; with Maddie, Sophia’s young
lesbian daughter, whose sexual naivete awakens old pain and new protectiveness in Paris; and
with Giulia, Maddie’s fiery sister . . . so alluring, so contradictory . .….

It’s also been a time of great publicity for feminist
bookstores. Publishers Weekly ran an excellent article
called “Women’s Bookstores: 20 Years and Thriving”
two weeks before ABA, Ms. Magazine asked me to

Feminist Publishers & Bookstores
Dinner
Nearly a hundred feminist bookstore workers
and feminist publishers from fifty organizations met
to celebrate our work over dinner Saturday night at
ABA. The food was bad enough to write home about
but the company was superb. We were a large and
rowdy crowd that obviously delighted in being to-
gether, the impromptu speeches were hilarious and
the jokes inspired Theresa Corrigan to start compiling
a humor column for FBN.

footwork to encourage booksellers to boycott Jason
Aronson (publishers) in protest of their homophobic
title, Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuals: A New
Clinical Approach, a therapy that claims to turn gay men
“straight,” only to discover the week before ABA that
the publisher had decided not to exhibit at the ABA.
The original plan was to pass out leaflets near the Jason
Aronson booth describing the book and calling for a
boycott and ready-to-sign postcards addressed to
Aronson stating: “I find it offensive that your company
would publish such a dangerous book as Reparative

Financial Survey of Feminist Bookstores

Dear Feminist Bookstores,
b I doo theo accouknting and borokkeepeing tat Aamazoin Blookestorer. We s just. e nded ou:r fiscal year and I went to
the library to get financial comparisons for book retailers and found that there was no information on feminist
I realized that while I could compare our financial statements to other bookstores of our size, these
bookstorės are not feminist bookstores and it was not an accurate comparison. I wanted to know how we
compared to others similar to ourselves. There's a hole in the information and I'd like to gather the
information to create a comparison for feminist bookstores. :
I believe the information would be helpful to us since our customers and storeinventory are considerably
different from mainstream bookstores.
I've enclosed a similar report to one that Id like to produce.* The report would also include some balance
sheet ratios (with explanations on how to use them). This info would be helpful for budgeting, comparing
expenses with similar sized stores (such as wages, advertising, profit margins). It’s also helpful and
interesting to see as a whole who we are and how we operate financially. We would begin to set our own
financial industry standard.
I need your year end balance sheet and annual income statement in addition to some other info. The
other information l'll need to do the comparison is listed below.
I'm very interested in organizing and analyzing this information and hope that you will be interested
in participating.
Id like to have the information by September 30.
If you have any questions please call me at 61 2-338-6560.
Thanks,
Kathy Sharp

Friday-Feminist Bookstores’ Day Two
As always, the day started with introducing our-
selves — fifty-some booksellers from 35 feminist
bookstores from Alaska to Florida. The total sales
volume for the 19 stores that gave that information
was $5,210,000 (an average of $275,000 per store). In

In years past we've gotten bogged down in trying
to define membership parameters. This year we
reached group concensus fairly quickly and also set
up small groups of feminist booksellers to review the
proposals made at the meeting, think about them in
more depth than we could manage in a one-hour
session, and to propose a structure and form to the
entire group of feminist bookstores for approval.

on to the rest of the feminist bookstores by mid- to
late-fall. (If you weren't at FB-Day and want to work on
this committee, give me a call!)
FB-Net will be financed through dues that will be
on a sliding scale. It was proposed that the average
contribution be $50 with a goal of raising about
$5000 /year, though we have yet to sit down to see
how that amount relates to the cost of doing the things
that feminist bookstores want FB-Net to achieve.
What would FB-Net do? Ideas abounded: coordi-

booksellers, organize a three day conference for femi-

Financial Survey
Kathy Sharp, Amazon’s new accountant, sent an
outline to FB-Day organizers for a financial survey of
feminist bookstores. She'll compile the information
and send it back to the bookstores. Bookstores at FB-
Day received copies of her questionnaire. Other stores
should have received copies in the mail. If you haven't
yet sent in your information, do if now! The results will
provide more financial information about feminist
bookstores and bookselling than we've ever had be-
fore and should be very helpful to everyone working
on financial management. (See Box.)

By Carol Seajay
Some would think that it wouldn't be possible to
organize an international feminist book fair in the
midst of an anti-feminist backlash and a world-wide
recession. By that line of thinking, most of our work,
most of our successes, and most of our joys simply
aren't possible. The gathering of women, of writers, of
ideas and of the visible manifestations of our successes
— the books, the publishing houses, the bookstores, the
magazines and journals — at the V International Fem-
inist Book Fair proves and celebrates feminist tenacity
in a particularly awesome way.
Officially 200 — but in actuality, closer to 300 —
publishers from nearly 40 countries (from five African,
six Asian, and nine Latin American countries as well as
from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zea-
land) shared 120+ individual and collective stands,
spilling out into the aisles in all directions. Fifteen hun-
dred women participated in the Trade Days, including
180 writers from 55 countries, (half from outside “the

Dear FBN,
To be gay in Russia means not only being differ-
ent, alien in ones own country. The attitude towards
gay people is very much the same in all countries.
What does make this country different from most of
the other countries in the world is the complete ab-
sence of any information about gay life in other places
and, what is even more important, the absence of any
information about gay culture. Here we know nothing

surrounded by homophobic ignorance. According to
the opinion polls, about 70% of the Russian popula-
tion believe that lesbians and gays, along with prosti-
tutes and -drug abusers, should be exterminated.
For the last few years some changes did take
place. There are about six lesbian and gay newspapers
and three or four gay groups now. But operating in a
country where male homosexuality is still a crime
punishable by law, these groups and papers concen-
trate themselves on human rights issues and do not
pay much attention to other problems of culture, reli-
gion and psychology.
These are the main reasons for starting this new
and special project — a lesbian and gay book club/-

gay culture available to those interested.

Sue Doro
Sue Doro, for thirteen years the only female machinist at the former Milwaukee
Road Railway is one of countless victims of widespread American plant closings.
In this powerful collection of poetry and essays, she speaks not only to the thou-
sands of workers who are subject to the devastating effects of these closings, but
also to all women who are forced to deal with gender issues at their place of em-
ployment. This book is not just for women who work nontraditional jobs—it is
for every woman who works.
We do not know if the author is an industrial worker with a writer's sensibility, or a
poet who works in industry. And that’s the way it should be: the authentic blend of shoulder and heart, experience
and vision. Rarely are we given such a gift. —Margaret Randall
Sue Doro writes.. .of the lives of workers and women at work, their double duties, their rich and often humorous
wealth of experience we have been robbed of. —Meridel Le Sueur
