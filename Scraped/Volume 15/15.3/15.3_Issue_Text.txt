only include newsletters, a directory of other segment

sales.) The ABA uses the membership list as the basis

the ABA staff did a great job of putting the first issue
together. Being FBN’s Chief Visionary in charge of

a few edtorial questions.
While this is clearly a first issue, there is an unfor-
tunate imbalance in several areas: both of the books
featured in the issue are mainstream press books; nei-
ther is by a visibly “out” lesbian; the “Touring” section
lists almost exclusively mainstream presses (one les-
bian press-published author, six authors published by

presses); the convention highlights section, while

old trap of covering only the work/events of lesbians publishers who have pioneered and created lesbian

[How D Ovo IDa TA A2
The newsletter and the segment face several vital
challenges.
1) To make lesbians as visible as gay men in this
“Gay & Lesbian” newsletter, to feature books by out
lesbians and lesbian presses, and not to fall into the
trap of recreating lesbian bookselling and publishing
ina 90s gay-male image. A number of distinct commu-
. nities fall under the banner of “Gay & Lesbian Book-
selling (and publishing)” and the challenge will be to
include all of them, rather than only the clearest com-
mon denominator and/or those who can afford full
time publicity staff.
2) To include news of lesbian bookselling and
publishing that occurs under the “feminist” rubric
rather than covering only the work that occurs under
the “gay” (male) or “gay-and-lesbian” banners, and to
make this truly a newsletter and segment of both
lesbian and gay bookselling, rather than a newsletter From Morgan Calabrese: The Movie, cartoons by

who work with gay men, while ignoring all of the literature and the mainstream publishers who are in-
creasingly publishing lesbian work. Mainstream
presses have been more active in publishing gay
men’s work, but there’s still an important balance to
be maintained. Ditto the booksellers. While ABA's
tendency is to cater to the more mainstream, general
booksellers and publishers, the specialty segments are
the places where ABA must not do this. Without the
“deviant"-from-the mainstream publishers and “devi-
ant” feminist, lesbian, and gay bookstores, there
would be no body of lesbian and gay literature for
general bookstores to sell and no market for general
publishers to sell to. While mainstream publishing
and general bookstore selling of lesbian and gay liter-
ature is a cause to be celebrated, that celebration must
not be used to obscure — or break the backs of — the
publishers and booksellers who are the backbone of
lesbian and gay literature. Without them/ us, gay lit-
erature is just another fad and our future will quickly
become passé.

Dear Women,
I saw a woman stealing in the store yesterday.
She was sitting hunched over on the floor in front of
the Fiction books and she was urgently stuffing
something inside her jacket on the left side. I froze. I
stared. I was shocked. Fear coursed through my body
like electricity and I thought I might faint on the spot.
I sped quickly to the front desk to sit down so I
wouldn't fall down. I sat with raging feelings, so
strong I can't find words to describe them fully. I
hated her. Later I knew I hated myself because I
couldn't protect the store; I couldn't protect me. Once
again I was raped and I was stuck with the feelings,
the act and no protection. I couldn't confront the
woman. I was so afraid she might not have done it.

In the last FBN we ran a “Success Stories” column
(collected from bookstores at Feminist Bookstores
day) instead of the regular Bookstore
News column. It seemed like a good idea
during the two month time in which I was
attending and writing up Feminist Book-
' stores Day, ABA, and the V International
Feminist Book Fair, but it sure leaves this
column with a back-log of un-covered
events!
It’s election time! Full Circle (Albu-

taking the “register more voters” cam-

the store is now an official voter registra-

Albuquerque to register to vote.

But Can She Type?
By Nett Hart
It’s all the rage to be “Post-Feminist” these days,
to see the demands of early second wave feminists as
too extreme or strident or, conversely, as having been
' met. Either way, the current attention to a feminist
backlash confirms that feminism is incompatible with
the status quo and that to be post-feminist is to make
your bed with the status quo.
By focusing concerns of feminism on the cur-
rently defined backlash, we propose the alternatives
as being that, in fact, feminists went too far and
brought on our own heads accelerated misogyny in
mass culture or that the status of women has im-
proved in the last two decades and those claiming
otherwise are either spoilers or individual failures.
While the focus on backlash has awakened some to
the probability that misogyny still exists, it has seri-
ously limited the work of feminists.
I think the theoretical turf on which an argument
takes place determines much of the questions asked
and all the outcome. I, for one, refuse to argue
whether women are human or deserving of equal
rights because it validates the possibility that a rea-
sonable person could think otherwise. If this is so
then much effort goes toward a positive judgment k

Lady Cassandra Stonehurst
i Stonehurst
í mucking out th setar es ins utttaer b dislbeeliefs a t thoe ffigure
by Barbara J ohnson Stonehurst Manor:
“The dark chestnut hair was cropped short; the snug, tan breeches and tight,
stained brown boots showed off well-muscled thighs and calves . . . No properly
brought up female would flaunt herself so brazenly, servant or no.”
Alex has been on her own since the age of eighteen. Her life is physically
harsh and demanding, but she lives as an independent woman.
Lady Cassandra is bound by the suffocating rules of her Regency world.
She is on the marriage block, her suitor the arrogant Lord Alfred Cavanaugh.
What could be less likely than the flowering of passionate love between
two women from such vastly different worlds? What could be more hopeless?
Lord Stonehurst banishes Alex from the Manor and arranges for
Cassandra’s marriage to Lord Alfred — putting an end, he thinks, to his
daughter’s recklessness. But he has gravely underestimated the courage of
these two young women determined to make real their impossible dreams.
