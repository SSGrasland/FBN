In a dark corner of the best bar in the city, two lovers fall into each other's arms. The bar has been called many names, but it is now known simply as The Bar. Its proprietor is the aging, still glamourous Madame. Its clientele is gay. The two who fall in love are Boy, a beautiful nineteen-year-old, and the handsome, forty-something Older Man referred to as O by the regulars of The Bar. This is the story of Boy's and O's courtship and marriage, of Madame's role in the affair, and of the man called Father, who threatens to come between them. Searingly honest in its deception of gay culture and ritual, this gripping novel is at once a moving celebratiion of love and a stark picture of life for gay men today.",en,Reissue,"Height: 5 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/39/9780452268739.jpg,Success,57.0,15.3

Early that year, Greenfield met and decided to photograph two young dancers, David Parsons and Daniel Ezralow. She used for the initial session - and for the first time - a borrowed Hasselblad camera. Her excitement at the result was immediate. ""I looked at the print,"" she says, ""and knew I was on to something."" What in fact this chance convergence of elements gave rise to was the archetypal Greenfield image: dynamic, witty, original and full of an energy so forceful that it seems contained only by the black lines of the camera frame. Breaking Bounds is a collection of 87 of these extraordinary images, taken between 1982 and 1991 and representing the best of Greenfield's mature personal work. That period saw her achieve her aim: to liberate the dancer from the dance. ""I tell my dancers,"" she says, ""to leave their choreography at the door,"" and here indeed we see dance as it has never been shown onstage. These are movements which arise through a collaboration between Greenfield and a host of dancers, unrestrained by the bounds of choreography, willing to take risks and to push to the absolute limits the boundaries of both photography and dance. This volume also represents a further collaboration between Greenfield and the eminent photographic historian and curator William A. Ewing, who has arranged these examples of her work into five sections that he calls Solo, Duo, Restraint/Release, Fission/Fusion and Breaking Bounds. He also provides an introduction and an interview with Lois Greenfield that charts her development from a young photojournalist to one of the finest photographers of the day. Lois Greenfield is recognized internationally as among the foremost photographers of dance. By choosing the world of experimental dance as her subject, she has created images of unbeli

                        <p>In this collection of photographs, made between 1982 and 1991, Lois Greenfield's revolutionary work captures the explosive energy and beauty of dancers' bodies in motion, as they present a powerful and elegant depiction of the human body in midair. 87 duotone photographs. 7 halftones.

Alcala understands the necessary understatement of magical realism. In one tale, a mild archbishop leaps off a balcony on impulse and soars above the village, waving to those below. He is particularly pleased that no one can smell his foul body odor from the distance. Many of the stories are mysteries of sorts, pivoting on unexpected, ironic turns of events yet moving methodically toward resolution. A fortune teller reveals the immediate future to a wild young man. ``You are going very fast . . . with a powerful man, a dangerous man . . . holding you against your will.'' When the youth angrily demands his money back, the police are called, drugs are discovered and the prophecy comes true. Other stories describe family traumas: a wife mistakes her husband's lust for gold for an affair with another woman; one of two elderly sisters visits with the dead and spends leisurely hours in purgatory. This is Alcala's first book, by turns touching, entertaining and surprising, and uniquely her own.

In This Brilliant And Magical Work, Ruth Behar Delves Well Beyond The Myths Of The Mexican Woman As Long-suffering Wife And Vindictive Witch As She Records Esperanza's Story In Her Own Words.

As A Young Woman She Loses Several Of Her Children; She Believes Her Rage At Her Own Violent Husband Poisoned Them Through Her Breastmilk. But There Is More To Her Story Than Abuse And Suffering. With Wit And Insight, Esperanza Describes Her Eventual Sexual And Financial Freedom, Her Relationship With Her Grown Daughters, And Her Spiritual Redemption Through The Cult Of Pancho Villa. Translated Woman Also Records The Subtle Ironies And Difficulties Inherent In Any Encounter Between Two People From Different Cultures And Classes. Behar Eventually Abandons The Traditional Roles Of Interviewer And Subject As Esperanza's Story Leads Her To Reflect On Her Own Life As A Cuban Immigrant In The United States.

Yet many men have helped advance their cause. Perhaps foremost among them was the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass. According to the women of the time, Douglass was their preeminent male supporter. As Elizabeth Cady Stanton said, ""He was the only man I ever saw who understood the degradation of the disfranchisement of women."" This book collects the speeches and writings of Frederick Douglass on women's rights. Since suffrage was the major concern of the movement, the issue of voting was primary among Douglass's themes; however, he also spoke and wrote resolutely on the need for women to reach their full potential by participating in every phase of American society and in every aspect of decision-making. No one was more insistent that the oppression of women violated the principles proclaimed at the birth of the American Republic. He was, in short, in favor of ""absolute justice and perfect equality"" for women. And because of his pride in his own race, he never failed to remind the white women who led the movement that black women endured an even greater oppression in white, male-dominated society than they did. Always eloquent and rarely less than inspiring, <i>Frederick Douglass on Women's Rights</i> presents the words of one of America's greatest spokesmen on one of the most important issues of the nineteenth century, words which still ring with truth and power today.",en,1,"Height: 0.58 Inches, Length: 8.3 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 5.39 Inches",17.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/92/9780306804892.jpg,Success,104.0,15.3

This Indian community, which probably dates back over a millennium, was home to one of America’s most talented and innovative potters—Lucy M. Lewis (d. 1992). 
<p>Born around the turn of the century, Lewis rose from humble origins to become one of the most important craftspersons of this century. As mother, matriarch, and artist, she made a monumental statement about her own society. She absorbed the work of her Indian ancestors, and from their ancient designs fashioned a modern sensibility that brought Indian pottery into the twentieth century.</p>
<p>She began making pots at an early age, teaching herself from shards she found around her home. With age, practice, and a keen eye came perfection, and eventually admirers. Her pieces are now in the collections of prominent museums in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, as well as throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p> Susan Peterson’s intimate biography is a major accomplishment. It captures the essence of this inspirational woman with candor and affection.

1-56584-030-5,Daughters of the Dust: The Making of an African American Woman's Film,"Dash, Julie",The New Press,173.0,1992-11-01,,Paperback,"In the winter of 1992, nearly one hundred years after motion pictures were invented, the first nationally distributed feature by an African American woman was released in the United States. Daughters of the Dust, written and directed by Julie Dash, was not only praised by critics but became a word-of-mouth sensation, selling out shows week after week. The New York Times called it a ""film of spell-binding visual beauty,"" and said that Dash ""emerges as a strikingly original film maker,"" and the Village Voice noted that viewers ""came in massive groups. They came multiple times."" The film tells the story of an African American sea-island, or Gullah, family preparing to come to the mainland at the turn of the century. In her richly textured, highly visual and lyrical portrayal of the day of their departure, Dash evokes the details of a persisting African culture and the tensions between tradition and assimilation. Daughters of the Dust: The Making of an African American Woman's Film, which includes Dash's complete screenplay, describes the story of her extraordinary sixteen-year struggle to complete the project. More than simply a tale of a rising artist, it is the record of an African American woman's determination to tell a story that is both historical and emotionally charged. With an introduction by Toni Cade Bambara, an extended interview with Dash by feminist critic bell hooks, an essay by Greg Tate, Dash's story in her own words, and sixteen pages of brilliant full-color images from the film by cinematographer Arthur Jafa, this is an important book for every admirer of the film and every student of cinema.

                        <p>Featuring Dash's story and production notes in her own words, this compelling chronicle of her struggle to complete Daughters of the Dust--the first nationally distributed film by an African American woman--is a book that every film buff and student of the art will want to own. Includes 16 pages of full-color photos from the film.

The niece of Theodore Roosevelt, she married a distant relative and Columbia University law student named Franklin Delano Roosevelt; he gradually ascended throughout the world of New York politics to reach the U.S. presidency in 1932. Throughout his three terms, Eleanor Roosevelt was not only intimately involved in FDRâs personal and political life, but led womenâs organizations and youth movements and fought for consumer welfare, civil rights, and improved housing. During World War II she traveled with her husband to meet leaders of many powerful nations; after his death in 1945 she worked as a UN delegate, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, newspaper columnist, Democratic party activist, world-traveler, and diplomat. By the end of her life, Eleanor Roosevelt was recognized throughout the world for her fortitude and commitment to the ideals of liberty and human rights.

Rosenthal--the dishy, neurotic, horny, cranky, and adamantly gay hero of Feinberg's Eighty-Sixed--is resurrected in this harrowing and insightful novel about AIDS and ...</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In content and in style, this tres gay sequel to Eighty-Sixed is a mixed bag--a smart drawstring purse, as man-hungry protagonist B.J. Rosenthal might say. Spanning the period from January 1985 to June 1990 (with a coyly prophetic appendix, ``After the Cure''), the novel chronicles amatory capers overshadowed by the specter of AIDS. ``I might as well buy condolence cards wholesale,'' laments B.J., who himself tests positive for the virus. Morbidity, however, is intermittently kept at bay by a dizzying parade of B.J.'s friends and paramours, whose dishy dialogue frequently makes them indistinguishable from one another. Confusing, too, are some of the time sequences: Feinberg's tangents have tangents, and he often seems to be writing in never-ending parenthetical asides. The tone is giddily and unremittingly New York, and the parade of retro repartee (``pure as the driven slush'') wears thin. Feinberg reins in the one-liners as the tone grows less determinedly fey, and there is real poignancy in one character's final days. While B.J.'s droll tone is ingratiating, readers may wish his voice were more consistent and less capricious.

Rule and Zimmerman have brought together leading scholars to show how different systems affect local, state, and national elections. Important demographic changes, new opportunities, and formidable problems are underscored in analyses of the effects of, among many other things, cumulative voting, judicial election systems, multimember and single-member districts, and reapportionment.</p>
<p>This study is unusual in combining an overall analysis of electoral systems and case material with proposals for making government more representative, inclusive, and responsive. Criteria are provided for evaluating the equity of electoral systems. The election of women and minorities to Congress is reviewed carefully, and options for increasing this direct representation of minorities and women are considered. Case studies describe legislative elections in several states. In-depth studies deal with local elections, cumulative and limited voting systems, alternative judicial electoral systems, and proportional representation. Academics and professionals who study political parties and electoral systems, minority politics, and women's studies will find this work to be especially intriguing and important.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.999988 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches",33.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/03/9780275942403.jpg,Success,104.0,15.3

This is not to say that a utopian workplace is portrayed herein. Exploitation has not been eradicated; equal pay is still the goal, not the reality. Work can often be boring and unfulfilling.<p>But women here are not victims. These are strong women -- survivors. They set boundaries, take risks, demand respect, and maintain their self-esteem, with or without the help of management, coworkers, family or friends. And they do it with a sense of humor! In traditional and nontraditional jobs, at home and in the workplace, these women are using their power to take charge of their own lives, challenging each of us to do the same.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This collection, conceived to broadly address the subject of women's work, focuses mainly on women in dead-end jobs struggling to make ends meet, with little hope of finding fulfilling employment opportunities. In Candida Lawrence's witty tale, ``Spotter,'' for example, Alice labors as a cashier at an amusement park, demeaned by her overzealous boss and the ridiculous uniform she must wear. Nevertheless, several of the stories here are noteworthy for their uncompromising portrayals of women fighting to gain respect and financial security in various work milieus, particularly Karen Loeb's ``Machines,'' Barbara Unger's ``Search Committee'' and Virginia Rudasill Mortenson's ``Hideaway Inn.'' Overall, the poetry tends to be amateurish and cliched. Kate Braid's ``These Hips'' is spoken by a female contractor whose ``strong hips are built for the birth of buildings,'' and Leslea Newman's ``Ode to Secretaries of America'' urges women to ``get up off their chairs and take a walk in the sun.'' The photographs are unexciting representations of women going about their everyday work routines. Martz is editor of Papier-Mache Press.

Illuminating The Implications Of These Writings, Spong Persuasively And. Provocatively Shows The Bible's Depiction Of A Virginal, Revered Yet Subservient, Mary To Be A Subtle, Unconscious Source For The Continued Oppression Of Women And A God-given Legitimization Of The Second-class Status Of Women In Western History. The Legacy Of The Mary Myths, Suggests Spong, Is Pervasive And Can Be Seen In Our Attitudes Toward Women And Female Sexuality, Sexual Harassment In The Workplace, The Notion Of A Celibate Priesthood, And The Exclusion Of Women. From Positions Of Ecclesiastical Power. Applauding The Fact That The Feminine Aspect Of God So Long Oppressed By The Masculine Patriarchy Is Roaring Back Into Our Awareness, Sweeping Away Our Male Prejudices And Even Our Male Definitions Of The Ideal Woman, Spong Shows That By Reclaiming The Humanity Of Christianity's Central Female Figure, We Reshape And Liberate Our Own Humanity.

Roman Catholic Bishops Have Failed For Nine Years To Complete A Single Letter Regarding The Standing Of Women In The Church. A Catholic Woman Can Be A Supreme Court Justice But She Cannot Be Ordained; She Can Run A City Or State But May Not Make Her Own Reproductive Choices Without Condemnation. Her Daughter Can Play On A Co-ed Softball Team But Cannot Serve On The Altar On Sunday Morning. Is It Possible, Then, To Be A Feminist And Remain Catholic? For Weaver, The Answer Is Yes. Though The Words Catholic Feminist May Seem A Contradiction In Terms For Many Women, In Weaver's View They Are A Challenge To Find New Sources Of Spiritual Nourishment, For Women Who Are In Exodus From The Patriarchal Church, And For Women Who Feel They Are In Exile From The Church That Was Once Their Home, Springs Of Water In A Dry Land Describes The Spiritual Options That Have Always Existed For Women And Provides Valuable Guidance In Keeping Both Aspects Of A Catholic Feminist Identity Intact. Weaver Urges Women To Look For Spiritual Truths In Places And Ways Sometimes Overlooked. Her Book Points Women Toward An Expansive Catholic Spirituality That Can Be Discovered Within And Outside Of The Catholic Tradition. The Life And Writing Of Teresa Of Avila, For Example, Inspire Women To Have Confidence In Their Own Relationships With God And To Trust Their Own Experience. In Other Chapters, Weaver Examines The Problems Of Women's Ordination, And The Possibilities Offered By Liberation Theology, Process Thought, And Goddess Spirituality. A God Who Desires Relationship Is Revealed In The Lives Of Women Who Are On The Margins Of The Catholic Tradition. These Women Are Pioneers, Weaver Shows Us, Whose Intuition And Experience Will Lead Them To Find Sustenance In Old Wellsprings, Toward New Ways Of Naming Their Spiritual Home.

Nowhere Has This Been More True Than In The Field Of Law, Where Feminist Legal Scholars Have Developed A Widely Read Body Of Theory. Within Law, The Postmodern Legal Feminists Have Brought A Unique Perspective, Making Use Of Deconstructive Strategies To Expose Contradictory And Repressed Elements Within Legal Texts. In Postmodern Legal Feminism, Mary Joe Frug Charts A Course For Future Feminist Thinking About Law. She Builds On Advances Made By Earlier Generations Of Legal Theorists: The Liberal Feminists Who Stressed Equality, The Radical Feminists Who Stressed Male Domination And Sexuality, And The Cultural Feminists Who Stressed The Positive Virtues Of Traditional Women's Values. But At The Same Time She Identifies The Limitations Of These Earlier Strands Of Legal Feminism And Demonstrates, Through Concrete Analysis Of Legal Doctrines, Texts, And Strategies, Why Postmodern Feminism Offers More Hope For Women. The Book Is Unusual Because It Offers Not Simply A Theoretical Exposition But A Series Of Demonstrations Of The Power Of Postmodern Legal Feminist Analysis. It Does So Through A Focus On Specific Examples Of Legal Writing (the Dawson, Harvey And Henderson Casebook; The Posner/rosenfeld And Hillman Articles), Specific Legal Doctrines (the Impossibility Doctrine; The Sears Case), And Specific Legal Strategies (the Impact Of Women In The Legal Profession; The Antipornography Campaign). It Is Also Unusual In That It Demonstrates The Relevance Of Non-legal Texts, Such As Carol Gilligan's In A Different Voice, To Law And The Relevance Of Law To Such Basic Social Issues As The Construction Of The Meaning Of Women's Bodies.

These themes position him as a transitional figure between traditional and modernist writers.Contents: 1. Poems (Translated by Jessie Lamont)2.

Ecological Healing Is A Theological And Psychic-spiritual Process, Writes Ruether. Although She Examines The Western Patriarchal Tradition From An Ecofeminist Perspective, Ruether Insists. That Classical Traditions Did Not Only Sacralize Patriarchal Hierarchy Over Women, Workers, And The Earth. They Also Struggled With What They Perceived To Be Injustice And Sin And Sought To Create Just And Loving Relations Between People In Their Relation To The Earth And To The Divine. Some Of This Effort To Name Evil And Struggle Against It Reinforced Relations Of Domination And Created Victim-blaming Spiritualities And Ethics. But There Are Also Glimpses In This. Heritage Of Transformative, Biophilic Relationships. These Glimpses Are A Precious Legacy That Needs To Be Separated From The Toxic Waste Of Sacralized Domination. Ruether Sees The Work Of Eco-justice And The Work Of Spirituality As Interrelated, The Inner And Outer Aspects Of One Process Of Conversion And Transformation. In Juxtaposing The Terms Gaia And God In The Title Of This Book, She Explores Crucial Issues Surrounding The Relationship Between The Living Planet. Earth, And Our Western Religious Traditions. Gaia Is The Greek Earth Goddess, And A Term Adopted By Biologists Such As James Lovelock And Lynn Margulis In Reference To Their Thesis That The Entire Planet Is A Living System Behaving As A Unified Organism. Growing Numbers Of People Have Begun To See The Jewish And Christian Male Monotheistic God As A Destructive Concept That Rationalizes Alienation From And Neglect Of The Earth, While Gaia, As An Immanent Divinity, Is Seen. As The All-nurturing Earth Mother Goddess. Ruether Points Out That Merely Replacing A Transcendent Male Deity With A Female One Does Not Answer The God-problem. What We Need, In Her View, Is A Vision Of A Much More Abundant And Creative Source Of Life. A Healed Relation To Each Other And To The Earth Calls For A New Consciousness, A New Symbolic Culture And Spirituality. Writes Ruether. We Need To Transform Our Inner Psyches And The Way We Symbolize The. Interrelations Of Men And Women, Humans And Earth, Humans And The Divine, The Divine And The Earth. Gaia And God Is A Major Critical Work By An Internationally Acclaimed Writer And Teacher. It Is A Sweeping Ecofeminist Theology That Argues For Healing Relationships Between Men And Women, Classes And Nations, And Humans And The Earth.

This Hybrid Provides An Unusual But Frequently Absorbing Narrative That Shifts Between Country And City, Mythic History And Modernity.

With an emphasis on civil rights throughout, the authors address such topics as adolescents with HIV, women with HIV, health insurance and the battle over limits on coverage, the criminalization of HIV infected persons, HIV in the workplace, and the responsibilities of health care providers.

The core of the novel lies in Anna's stormy relationship with her son and his American family, fueled by mutual guilt at the death of relatives in the concentration camps. Anna's adjustment to the baffling mores of a new country, as well as the final making peace with her family, give the novel a powerful emotional resonance shared by the best of family sagas.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.3 Inches, Weight: 1.4991433816 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/52/9781558610552.jpg,Success,77.0,15.3

Among These Items Was A Box Containing The Typescripts Of More Than Two Hundred Poems, A Few Of Which Had Been Published In Magazines Such As The Fugitive, Poetry Nomad, Lyric West, And Contemporary Verse. Then Aged Twenty-four, Laura Riding Had Already Been Hailed As A Leading Voice Of Her Generation. She Had Come To New York To Pursue A Life Devoted To Poetry, But Saw Her American Contemporaries As Lacking A Seriousness, Both Poetic And Personal, Which She Considered To Be The Poet's Essential Attribute. So When An Invitation Came From Robert Graves And Nancy Nicholson In England, She Accepted.^ In Europe She Found Solitariness In Which To Probe The Reality Of Poetry As A Spiritual, Not Merely Literary, Inheritance. Although By 1938 She Could Say That To Live In, By, For The Reasons Of, Poems Is To Habituate Oneself To The Good Existence, Her Probing Finally Led Her To Renounce Poetry; She Had Found Poetic Utterance Inherently Incapable Of Yielding The Full Truth-potential Of Words. Meanwhile The Correspondence With The Friend In New York Had Continued. In 1979 Her Friend Wrote That She Had Discovered, In Storage, The Cache Of Poems Left Behind. Arrangements Were Made For Its Return, And During The Months Before Her Death In 1991, Laura (riding) Jackson Was Preparing These Early Poems For Publication.^ Rediscovering These Poems Of Her Youth, Laura (riding) Jackson Saw In Them A Precise Anticipation Of An Envisaged Whole Of Poetry. Readers Will Find Here The Same Confident Authorial Presence That Permeates The Self-determining Canon Of Her Poetic Work, Which She Identified As Her Collected Poems Of 1938 (reprinted In 1980 By Persea As The Poems Of Laura Riding), Many Of The Themes Developed In Her Later Work, And A Characteristic Freshness Of Vision And Scrupulosity Of Word-use. These Poems Are Experiments In What Poetry Can Do. They Are Early Stepping Stones On The Path That Led Laura (riding) Jackson Ultimately To A Realization Of What Poetry Cannot Do. Those Familiar With The Poetry Of Laura Riding Will Read First Awakenings With The Delight Of Enlarged Recognition, And Those Approaching It As An Introduction To Her Work Will Find Direction For The Mind's Journey.

Murdered after his last performance in his last theatrical production, Minneapolis restaurateur-sleuth Jane Lawless finds his body onstage, impaled on a part of the set. Before long, a series of coincidences places Jane in the role of prime suspect.</p>
<p>Determined to clear her name, Jane turns to her best friend, Cordelia, for help. Together, their intuition leads them to the dead man's family, a glamorous—and appropriately melodramatic—Midwestern theatrical dynasty. Jane and Cordelia must separate the theatrics from reality before Jane takes the blame for someone else's crime, and their search for the true killer uncovers a tangled and dangerous web of deceit. All in all, <i>Stage Fright</i> is another engaging, dynamic installment in Ellen Hart's award-winning series.</p>


                        <p>Lesbian sleuth Jane Lawless takes center stage in her third thrilling whodunit when an aging actor is murdered--and Jane becomes a suspect. But the truth lies with members of the dead man's famous theatrical family, who give their grandest performances offstage. Previous publisher: Seal Press.

It is years since the half-elven Lord Rhodry took the throne of Aberwyn. When Rhodry's lost lover, Jill-now a powerful wizard-comes to Aberyn and tells him it's time he accepted his elven heritage, Rhodry faces the most difficult choice of his life.

At the center of that circle, walking in beauty, were women. From early childhood girls prepared for their role by playing with miniature tipis and dolls dressed in tribal clothing. They practiced the arts of sewing, beading, tanning buffalo hides, and decorating with porcupine quills. The clothes they wore and the implements they used were objects of art in themselves. To the Indian, there is no distinction between art and life or between what is beautiful and what is functional. Here, in stunning photographs, are the clothing and objects that were a part of daily life for Native American women. From moccasins, buckskin dresses, and jewelry, to blankets, tipis, and household tools, these objects are intricate works of art. Woven into the pictorial display are four intriguing legends illustrating the variety of women's roles in Native American life. Forty of the pieces are from the magnificent David T. Vernon Collection permanently on display at the Colter Bay Indian Arts Museum in Grand Teton National Park. Sixty additional works are from the San Diego Museum of Man. C.J. Brafford, curator at the Colter Bay Indian Arts Museum, has provided lyrical introductions connecting the legends with life and art. Another specialist in Native American art, Laine Thom, provides fascinating details and background information in the captions that accompany each photograph. The legends, photographs, and excellent commentary blend into a beautiful and informative book about the harmony of life and art in Native American culture.

                        <p>In the bestselling tradition of The Spirit of Native America, this beautifully illustrated volume showcases the elaborate artistry of Native American women's clothing and explores the ritual, custom, and skill inherent in its design. Full-color throughought.

<br>
In <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me About Christopher Columbus</i>, the bestselling author of <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> offers a graphic corrective to the Columbus story told in so many American classrooms. First published over fifteen years ago and long out-of-print, the poster and accompanying paperback book sum up the mis-tellings—and reveal the real story—in a graphically appealing and accessible format.<br>
<br>
In vintage Loewen fashion, the poster juxtaposes short quotes from a range of high school textbooks currently in use today, with excerpts from primary sources that clearly show how textbooks have ""lied"" by knowingly substituting crowd-pleasing myths for grim and gruesome historical evidence.<br>
<br>
In fact, these textbooks intentionally omitted every important detail that we do know about Columbus's fateful voyage to the Americas. Among countless other facts, Loewen demonstrates that Columbus and his men were far from the first to set foot in the ""New World,"" and that the peoples he encountered there did not submit to the ""god-like"" authority of him and his crewmen, but rather to the deadly forms of smallpox and bubonic plague they brought with them from Europe.<br>
<br>
In concise, deeply engaging prose, Loewen expands on these little-discussed facts, putting them in the larger context of a discussion of ""truth"" and revisionist history. Originally published as <i>The Truth About Columbus</i>.

                        <p>Examines the truths and myths surrounding the voyages of Columbus, presenting an alternative history intended to differ from that offered in many school textbooks.
