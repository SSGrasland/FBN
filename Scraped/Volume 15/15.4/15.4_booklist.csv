It Was To Retrieve An Important Part Of Women's History From The Hands Of Male Writers - Who Have Defined Prostitution From Their Own Point Of View As The Client Sex - That Nickie Roberts Undertook This Invigorating Blend Of Social History And Sexual Politics. In Her Far-reaching Narrative Account, The Author Proclaims Herself Unreservedly On The Side Of The. Unrepentant Whore, The Most Maligned Woman In History. From The High-ranking Temple Whores Of Egypt And The Courtesans Of Ancient Greece And Rome, She Tells The Story Of The Prostitute With Liberal Quotations From Contemporary Sources And Anecdotes Of Bawdy-house And Brothel Life. She Shows How, In The Middle Ages, The Church Exploited The Sex Industry To Build Churches Out Of The Proceeds; She Describes The High-class Cortegiane Of Renaissance Italy, The French Maisons. De Tolerance And The Lives Of The Grandes Horizontales; And She Analyses The Victorian Denial Of Female Sexuality (which Enabled The Bourgeois Male To Concentrate Exclusively On His Own) And The Double Standards Of Conventional Attitudes. In The 20th-century Section, She Gives Whores Their Voice And Describes Whores' Movements Such As The English Collective Of Prostitutes And The American Coyote (call Off Your Old Tired Ethics). She Criticizes Legislative Attempts At. Control, Challenges Orthodox Views On Prostitutes, Dissects Feminist Approaches To The Subject ('all Sex Work Is Degrading To Women') And Argues Strongly In Favour Of The Decriminalization Of Prostitution And The Sexual And Financial Autonomy Of The Whore. The Result Is A Vivid, Stimulating And Well-researched Work Of History Whose Perspective On The Subject Is Both Original And Provocative, And Whose Argument Will Engage Both Male 'experts' And Feminist 'sisters' Alike. 1.

Naomi Miller, Ph.D., a clinician and expert in family relations, looks at a new and emerging group of single parents, namely, those who, not unlike couples, came to their decision for single parenthood intentionally. In contrast to teenage mothers, these men and women are, for the most part, older, educated, professionally successful, and financially secure. By offering relevant demographic, research, and sociocultural data, as well as a series of intensely personal and revealing interviews, Single Parents by Choice investigates what led these people to make such a decision. These new family constellations involve the following four separate groups: single biological mothers; single adoptive mothers or fathers (including those who have adopted older children as well as infants); divorced parents (i.e., the active parent who has decided not to remarry); and gay and lesbian parents (a relatively new category of alternative parenting). Listening to the poignant stories of those who have chosen single parenthood, we learn about their family backgrounds and how these played a significant role in shaping the hopes and aspirations for creating their own families. We hear about their ambitions, social lives, and love relationships, and what ultimately led them to decide to take on the responsibilities of parenthood outside the bonds of marriage. They talk about their experiences as parents and what impact their single status as parents and what impact their single status has had on their children, as well what kinds of responses they have received from family, friends, and society at large. Some important questions are raised, namely, what are the psychological implications for the children, and how do they compare to children of two-parent families?

The War Changed Forever The Face Of The Nation, The Nature Of American Politics, The Status Of African-americans, And The Daily Lives Of Millions Of People. Yet Few Of Us Understand How The War Transformed Gender Roles And Attitudes Toward Sexuality Among American Citizens. <b>divided Houses</b> Is The First Book To Address This Sorely Neglected Topic, Showing How The Themes Of Gender, Class, Race, And Sexuality Interacted To Forge The Beginnings Of A New Society.<br> In This Unique Volume, Historians Catherine Clinton And Nina Silber Bring Together A Wide Spectrum Of Critical Viewpoints&#151;all Written By Eminent Scholars&#151;to Show How Gender Became A Prism Through Which The Political Tensions Of Antebellum America Were Filtered And Focused. For Example, <b>divided Houses</b> Demonstrates That The Abolitionist Movement Was Strongly Allied With Nineteenth-century Feminism, And Shows How The Ensuing Debates Over Sectionalism And, Eventually, Secession, Were Often Couched In Terms Of Gender. Northerners And Southerners Alike Frequently Ridiculed Each Other As Effeminate&#58; Slaveowners Were Characterized By Yankees As Idle And Useless Aristocrats, Enfeebled By Their Peculiar Institution; Northerners Were Belittled As Money-grubbers Who Lacked The Masculine Courage Of Their Southern Counterparts.<br> Through The Course Of The Book, Many Fascinating Subjects Are Explored, Such As The New Manly Responsibilities Both Black And White Men Had Thrust Upon Them As Soldiers; The Effect Of The War On Southern Women's Daily Actions On The Homefront; The Essential Part Northern Women Played As Nurses And Spies; The War's Impact On Marriage And Divorce; Women's Roles In The Guerilla Fighting; Even The Wartime Dialogue On Interracial Sex. There Is Also A Rare Look At How Gender Affected The Experience Of Freedom For African-american Children, A Discussion Of How Harriet Beecher Stowe Attempted To Distract Both Her Readers And Herself From The Ravages Of War Through The Writing Of Romantic Fiction, And A Consideration Of The Changing Relations Between Black Men And A White Society Which, During The War, At Last Forced To Confront Their Manhood. In Addition, An Incisive Introduction By Pulitzer Prize-winning Historian James Mcpherson Helps Place These Various Subjects In An Overall Historical Context.<br> Nowhere Else Are Such Topics Considered In A Single, Accessible Volume. <b>divided Houses</b> Sheds New Light On The Entire Civil War Experience&#151;from Its Causes To Its Legacy&#151;and Shows How Gender Shaped Both The Actions And Attitudes Of Those Who Participated In This Watershed Event In The History Of America.</p>",en,1,"Height: 1.08 Inches, Length: 8.76 Inches, Weight: 1.2566348934 Pounds, Width: 6.06 Inches",37.88,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/46/9780195080346.jpg,Success,37.0,15.4

The Woman's Commonwealth combined an ideology of celibacy with traditional business practices to achieve women's economic independence. Based on a large collection of personal letters exchanged among the group's twenty to twenty-five members, primarily mothers and their daughters, the book functions on several levels. First, it chronicles the history and beliefs of the community, its business enterprises - successful hotels and boardinghouses - and the personalities and relationships of its members. Second, Kitch considers the role of the letters themselves in the formation, maintenance, and ultimate dissolution of the group. Whereas most studies of women's letters have focused primarily on their role as historical documents, this book explores the symbolic or literary characteristics of the correspondence and applies narrative theory to its interpretation. Finally, Kitch assesses the community from various feminist theoretical perspectives and considers the Commonwealth's significance to modern feminism. For readers interested in feminism, American history and religion, utopian studies, cross-generational relationships, and for those who study letters or diaries as keys to understanding history and society, This Strange Society of Women offers a new way of examining early feminist communities and their importance to the history of American women.",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.69976404002 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",55.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/92/9780814205792.jpg,Success,40.0,15.4

Young career diplomat Jim Goodall so deeply fears his ""crushes"" on men that, as Uncle Jim, he lavishes his affection on a favorite niece. When he is posted to the Marcos-controlled Philippines, his rigid celibacy has even a giggling Imelda Marcos calling him ""the Vicar"" - until a friend invites him to war-torn, destructive Vietnam. A murder in a jungle village and a Saigon orgy of on-leave servicemen, Asian gay boys, and rich colonials force Jim Goodall into a dramatic confrontation with himself. Beginning a personal odyssey that takes him from the pleasures of Bangkok's notorious Patpong to the shock of witnessing state-sanctioned torture in Manila, he becomes a man on a tightrope, balanced between living silently with his own lies and those of his government, or risking everything to expose them both.

Alcala understands the necessary understatement of magical realism. In one tale, a mild archbishop leaps off a balcony on impulse and soars above the village, waving to those below. He is particularly pleased that no one can smell his foul body odor from the distance. Many of the stories are mysteries of sorts, pivoting on unexpected, ironic turns of events yet moving methodically toward resolution. A fortune teller reveals the immediate future to a wild young man. ``You are going very fast . . . with a powerful man, a dangerous man . . . holding you against your will.'' When the youth angrily demands his money back, the police are called, drugs are discovered and the prophecy comes true. Other stories describe family traumas: a wife mistakes her husband's lust for gold for an affair with another woman; one of two elderly sisters visits with the dead and spends leisurely hours in purgatory. This is Alcala's first book, by turns touching, entertaining and surprising, and uniquely her own.

Juxtaposing Autobiography And Ethnography, Linden Begins This Study By Situating Herself In The Context Of Her Assimilated Jewish Family, Where The Holocaust Was Shrouded In Silences. Urged Forward By These Silences, Linden, A Feminist And Sociologist, Began To Interview Jewish Holocaust Survivors In 1983. As Linden Interprets Survivors' Accounts Of The Death Camps And The Resistance, She Reveals Complex Ways In Which Selves Are Constructed Through Storytelling. The Stories That Unfold Are Continuously Fashioned And Refashioned - Never Stripped Of Context Or Frozen In Time. What Emerges Is An Unexpectedly Elegant Montage In Which Interviewee, Interviewer, And Author Are Intertwined. Linden's Meetings With Survivors And Her Encounters With Their Stories Transformed Her As A Feminist, A Jew, And A Social Scientist. Her Analysis Reveals The Intimate Connections Between An Ethnographer's Lived Experience And Her Interpretations Of Others'. Linden's Reflections On The Process Of Ethnography Belie The Rhetoric Of Positivism In The Social Sciences. They Will Inspire Other Scholars To Break Free Of Research And Writing Practices In Their Own Disciplines That Efface The Ineluctable Bond Between Knower And Known. All Readers Will Be Challenged To Reexamine The Holocaust In An Intensely Personal Light And To Reconsider The Meanings Of Survival In Our Own Time. Cutting Across The Boundaries Of Ethnography And Autobiography To Create A New Kind Of Text, Making Stories, Making Selves Offers A Significant Contribution To Interpretive Social Science And The Literature Of The Holocaust. Linden's Original And Courageous Work Is Vital Reading For Holocaust Scholars, Students Of Modern Jewish Life Sociologists Feminist Theorists, And All Readers Seeking To Understand Their Own Relationship To The Holocaust.

0-19507-926-4,World Human Rights Guide,,Oxford University Press,416.0,1992-10-22,,Paperback,"<p>Today, human rights are receiving more attention worldwide than ever before. With the universal impact of television coverage, the moves to democracy by the former Eastern Bloc nations and the countries of southern Africa, a United Nations expanding its influence and effectiveness, and the increasingly educated and more socially-conscious world population, there has been a significant surge in concern for human rights victims and condemnation of their oppressors. Now available in a new edition, this unique survey—the only one of its kind—provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on the human rights records in over one hundred countries, making it an essential guide for anyone concerned with, or involved in, one of the major global issues of our times.<br>
 Drawing on sources as diverse as leading world human rights organizations, official bodies and unofficial monitors, and individuals who have suffered or witnessed abuses firsthand, the <b>World Human Rights Guide</b> assesses the performance of every major country according to guidelines set in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various United Nations treaties. Compiled by Charles Humana, a human rights campaigner whose work has gained an international reputation, the survey is presented in the form of forty questions and answers covering both traditional human rights—such as democratic elections, freedom of speech and learning, association, and travel—and the broader area of state power—including the censorship of media, telephone tappings, summary executions and torture, independence of courts, and freedom in private affairs. The results are reprinted in their entirety, and assessed by the Humana Method to give a Human Rights Rating. It provides what the United Nations Development Programme has described as ""the most systematic and extensive coverage"" of the classification of human rights.<br>
 Basic facts about each nation are also provided—such as population size, political system, per capita income, and infant mortality rate—as well as a brief summary of factors that affect human rights. The guide also includes a Progress Report—the first of its kind—which compares the 1986 ratings with those for 1991 with heartening results; and an incisive introduction and full notes, explaining the meaning of the data collected, help place the report in a clear, even-handed perspective.<br>
 Nowhere else is so much vital information brought together in a single, accessible volume. In 1992, despite the progress of the last two or three years, over half the world's population live under regimes which deny the most basic human freedoms: the appearance of his authoritative study not only informs readers, but offers the clearest indictment yet of the human rights crimes being perpetrated by oppressive governments. The <b>World Human Rights Guide</b> is absolutely indispensable for anyone who desires a new world order based on respect for people, rather than their oppression.</p>",en,3,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.258 Inches, Weight: 1.28088574222 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/65/9780195079265.jpg,Success,37.0,15.4

0-252-01801-x,On Intimate Terms: The Psychology of Difference in Lesbian Relationships,"Burch, Beverly",University of Illinois Press,192.0,1992-12-01,"Relationships, Gay & Lesbian Studies",Hardcover,"On Intimate Terms looks at the internal logic of lesbian relationships, arguing that they are not patterned after heterosexual ones but rely on the interplay of psychosexual differences between women. The book suggests that everyone seeks psychic complementarity with an Other in intimate relationships as a way of supporting personal growth and development. A complementary partner is one who is different in some individually meaningful way, not necessarily in terms of gender. Drawing upon interviews with individuals and lesbian couples, literature on lesbian psychology, and contemporary psychoanalytic theory, Beverly Burch observes a special attraction between primary lesbians - women who have been attracted to other women from an early age - and lesbians who formerly were heterosexual. This difference may be a source of tension for lovers, but it also attracts and bonds them in conscious and unconscious ways. The intimacy between lesbian partners permits interpersonal exchanges that foster the continuing development of each, according to Burch. This development can occur in three areas, with the significance of each varying from couple to couple. It can be a source of both conscious and unconscious psychosexual exchanges, a way in which each partner can experience the road not taken through her relationship with the other. The partners' different histories can reflect different ways of negotiating difference itself, a pivotal theme in the development of adult women. And gender role identities related to different developmental experiences can be played with, expanding the experience of being female in a way that can challenge gender categories.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/15/9780252018015.jpg,Success,39.0,15.4

In Both Greece And Rome, Same Gender Sexual Relationships Were Acknowledged, And Those Between Men Were Not Only Tolerated But Widely Celebrated In Literature And Art. Nor For Greeks And Romans Was Homosexuality An Exclusive Choice, But Alternative To And Sometimes Concurrent With The Love Of The Opposite Sex. Whilst Exploring Aspects Of The Female Condition In Classical Antiquity, Eva Cantarella Came To Understand That The Sheer Ubiquity Of Male Homosexuality Had A Fundamental Impact On Relationships Between Men And Women. Drawing On The Full Range Of Surviving Sources - Legal Texts, Inscriptions, Medical Documents, Poetry And Philosophical Literature - She Now Reconstructs The Homosexual Cultures Of Greece And Rome And Provides A Full, Readable And Thought-provoking History Of Bisexuality In The Classical Age. Cantarella Explores The Psychological, Social And Cultural Mechanisms That Determined Sexual Choice And Consider: The Extent To Which That Choice Was Free, Directed Or Coerced In Each Civilization. In Greece The Relationship Between Adults And Youngs[sic] Boys Was Deemed The Noblest Of Associations, A Means Of Education And Spiritual Exhaltation[sic]. Cantarella Reveals That Such Relationships, Though Highly Regulated And Never Left To Individual Spontaneity, Were More Than Pedagogic And Platonic: They Were Fully Carnal. In Imperial Rome, However, The Sexual Ethic Mirrored The Political And Males Were Cruelly Domineering In Love As In War. The Critical Sexual Distinction Was That Between Active And Passive, The Victims Commonly Being Slaves Or Defeated Enemies, Rather Than Young Roman Freemen. In Terms Of Female Bisexuality, Accounts Of Love Between Roman Women Were Transmitted Exclusively By Men. In Greece, However, Women Had Sappho To Give Them Voice. Cantarella Examines The Activities Of The Thiasoi - Greek Communities Of Women - And Reveals That Their Ritual Ceremonies Also Embraced Passionate Love. Cantarella Explains How The Etiquette Of Bisexuality Was Corrupted Over Time And How, Influenced By Pagan And Judeo-christian Traditions, Homosexuality Came To Be Regarded As An Unnatural Act. Her Interpretation Goes Further Than Any Previous Study, Claiming Not Only That Homosexuality Was Common, But That For Greeks Of Both Genders It Constituted True Love.--jacket.

These stories, verses, works of art, and theater pieces voice the concerns and aspirations of an often silent minority. They can be poignant, erotic, resolute or angry, but always reflect the affirming power of coming together to build a strong black gay community. Editor Joseph Beam began collecting this material in 1984 after years of frustration with gay literature that had no message for - and little mention of - black gay men. The bottom line, he wrote, is this: We are Black men who are proudly gay. What we offer is our lives, our love, our visions... We are coming home with our heads held up high.                        <p>Here, thirty-three writers and artists explore what it means to be doubly different--black and gay--in modern America.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.73193470984 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",2.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/35/9780932870735.jpg,Success,76.0,15.4
