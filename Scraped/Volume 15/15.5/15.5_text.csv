Dreams and Swords

Indianapolis IN 46220
Dear FBN women,
We have some wonderful news. Last month, at
Indiana's annual gay and lesbian recognition banquet,
Dreams and Swords received the 1992 Hoosier Business
Service Award. It was awarded to us for our “outstand-
ing service to the gay and lesbian community of Indi-
ana.” Owner Harriet Clare was thrilled to accept the
award. It was a well deserved pat on the back for all the
years Harriet and her bookstore have survived here in
the Bible Belt (we were 10 last March}!). It all started in
1980, when Harriet recognized the need for a feminist
bookstore, and hauled boxes of books every Friday to
Labyris, a much missed real women’s bar, for “book-
store night.” But then that’s another story...
Things here at Dreams and Swords are going

She also explores the “people-lessness” of the
North American immigrants, how for the first time
historically people emigrated as individuals rather
than as groups (forming a political rather than a cul-
tural entity), and the lost-ness and emptiness that
ensued. This is part of understanding the underlying
cause of why anyone would try to appropriate
another's culture (as well as their land, and material
goods).
An analysis like that isn’t the only necessary com-
ponent of understanding and un-learning racism and
cultural appropriation but can be a part of the healing
that makes change possible.
We felt that it was a critical message for “white”
women looking in our Native American section for
“spirituality,” as well as useful for anyone interested
in the subject of appropriation of Native culture; that’s
why the placement made initial sense.

Plans for the 1994 International Feminist Book Fair
are proceeding apace. The Australian committee has
been awarded a $120,000 grant to be used for setting
up an office and proceeding with the plans for the Sixth
IFBF. The mailing lists and data bases for the Interna-
tional Feminist Book Fairs have officially been passed
to the Australian organizers for the 1994 IFBF.
Quantas has promised to provide cut-price
group-flights from all over the world.
The Fair is tentatively scheduled for the last
weekend in July and will be coordinated with several
other women’s studies and feminist conferences so
that women can travel to Australia for at least two
major events rather than one.

It’s wonderful to see the kinds of books that are
being written for children today. Books that reflect
different cultures, that acknowledge how the family
has changed, that empower children to tell the truth
and claim their feelings. All the books we wish we'd
had as children! Phoenix Books has made a commit-
ment to stock books for children and parents that
reflect the real world and teach acceptance, empower-
ment and a world vision that includes everyone. We
stock our parenting books in the children’s section and
try to make the connection between healthy parenting
and happy kids.

Publisher’s Column:
By Ruth Gottstein tional Science Teachers Association, the National
Volcano Press Council of Teachers of English, and the National
Council for Social Studies.
In winter of 1991 I wrote an article for Small Press SK A
magazine analyzing the structure and ubiquitous na-
ture of the Children’s Book Council. This article was
the result of my constantly encountering CBC in my
efforts to market and promote Volcano Press's
children’s books. There appeared to be some “inner
loop” I couldn't penetrate.
I had been discovering that one of the important
aspects of selling children’s books was the need to
reach the professional organizations that publish “rec-
ommended” lists. These validations, I learned, are
critically important to a book's success. I also learned
that the Children’s Book Council, a marketing associ-
ation composed of approximately 65 dues-paying
members, represents all the major children’s book
publishers in the United States. Many of these compa-
nies are international corporations who own ten or
more imprints (Penguin, for example).
I discovered that CBC is actually composed of
two separate groups, so closely entertwined that, to
the book world and the general public, they appear to
be one. The first group is the marketing association.
The second group consists of interlocking “liai-
son” committees with highly respected professional
organizations; these prestigious groups include the
American Library Association/Association Library

Dear Ruth,
When the CBC Board met earlier this week, I
reported on the conversation you and I had on Octo-
ber 13 regarding Children’s Book council membership
for “small presses.”
The Board agreed with you that both small
presses and CBC would benefit from small press par-
ticipation, but felt it would be an abrogation of its
fiduciary responsibility to increase Council expenses
by adding members whose dues would be less than
the cost of processing and servicing their member-
ships. This is a particularly sensitive issue in a year
when the Council anticipates a deficit. It also seems an
inopportune time to devote the energies of an already
overextended staff to the considerable task of identi-
fying and surveying small presses. CHIL DARMEENR'SI C ABNOO KB O OCOKUSENLCLIELR SJ OAINSSTO CCIAOMTIMONITTEE

1992. Caroline van Essen has worked with Xan-
tippe for 12 of those 17 years. She is now the
foreign book buyer for the shop, which was
named after the sharp- tongued wife of Socrates.
“She was supposed to be a very strong
woman, maybe a little bitchy,” van Essen says
of Xantippe, “and someone you have to re-
spect.” You have to respect the perseverance of
the bookstore workers also. The shop, located
along Prinsengracht canal in Amsterdam, is in
the strongest financial position of all the Dutch
women’s bookstores, according to van Essen.
“We have the advantage,” she said, “of
being in the capital, where there are lots of
universities and women’s studies.” Sales to
universities amount to 50% of the store's total
business, which comes to about Dfl. 400,000
(approximately $250,000) annually. “We
don't have much competition,” van Essen
said. “The academic bookshops call us. We try

bulletin board carries news of community events, while
a stack of petitions and a booklet on female genital
mutilation is on the counter. Xantippe has joined with
numerous Black and immigrant women’s groups in
campaigning against a Dutch government proposal to
legalize cliterectomies in the Netherlands.
It is quite a change from 17 years ago. “Xantippe
started as a collective by 12 women students, who were
dissatisfied with the regular bookshops,” van Essen
said. “There were no sections for women’s studies then.
The students collected all the books important for
women, which amounted to a few shelves. They were
all volunteers and had no money, so the publishers,
sympathetic feminist publishers, gave them free stock
and were paid when the books were sold. It worked for
about two years like this, until there was enough profit
to set up as an official bookshop.” Three women now
run the store, two of them full-time paid workers.
Contact with the other seven women’s bookshops
in the country is difficult, van Essen said. “Several
years ago there was a meeting once a year, but the
differences are so much. There is no women’s book-
store bulletin. I think it could be useful but I can’t see
it happening by women in the bookshops. There is
already too much work to do — an extra magazine
would be too much,” she said.
Bookselling is big business in Amsterdam — there
are almost 100 bookstores in the city, many of them
specializing in rare, out- of-print or second-hand
books. Almost directly across the canal from Xantippe
is Antiquariaat Lorelei, which sells second-hand books
by and about women. It may be the largest second-
hand women’s bookstore in Europe. Antiquariaat Lo-
