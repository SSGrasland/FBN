In a plot shocking for its blatant familiarity, a figure identified as The Senator tipsily drives a young woman away from a Fourth of July party, veers off a dock and plunges the car into dank water, where he deserts her and she drowns, a chastely wrapped condom still in her Laura Ashley purse. Brief chapters, some taut as prose poems, sink into Kelly's past (she had hoped to help him campaign for the presidency) and then surge forward. Ebbing and rising like the engulfing waters, the narrative, too, swallows her in its finale. Returning to the theme of Death and the Maiden (the picture hangs on a wall in American Appetites , and the phrase was the original title of her classic short story ``Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?''), Oates here extracts a deeper, more terrible meaning. Kelly feels ``chosen,'' having long ago fallen under the sway of Politics and Eros as incarnated by the treacherous Senator, on whom she based her college honors thesis. The author chillingly augments her scrutiny of the tainted American official by incorporating statements about capital punishment by current legalists. Oates is at the top of her stunning form. 50,000 first printing; BOMC selection; author tour.

The story she tells is as monumental as its main character. In 1959, 13-year-old Marietta Cook lives with her ailing mother in the tiny, Gullah-speaking village of Pine Gardens, S.C. They eke out a precarious existence by gardening, fishing and selling handwoven baskets by the roadside. Marietta, who is descended on her dead father's side from a slave the townspeople remember as ``Africa woman,'' is far darker-skinned than anyone else in the community, and she is enormously tall. This--and her taciturn nature in a society where women fill their days with constant talk--makes her an outsider who is never fully accepted, not even by her family. When her mother dies, Marietta leaves Pine Gardens for Charleston ? ck. till now she's said to have been in Pine Gardens.// ok and participates briefly in the civil rights movement, an experience that resonates for her later, when she finds herself doing day work in the homes of wealthy white women. When she returns home, pregnant, a gruff yet loving aunt helps her to give birth to twin boys and becomes an uneasy role model. The novel follows the small family to the twins' adulthood, as they struggle to become professional football players. Throughout, Marietta is an impassive yet transfixing character who bears her troubles stoically, complex though they often are. Along with Straight's fluid prose and so as not to virtually repeat `eloquently written' above accomplished use of dialogue, this powerful book is remarkable for the dignity and integrity with which she infuses her characters and their lives.

Were the bars of the 1940s and 1950s more fun than the bars today? Did black and white lesbians socialize together<br>? <br> <b></b><b><i>Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold</i></b> is a groundbreaking account of the growth of the lesbian community in Buffalo, New York from the mid-1930s to the early 1960s. Drawing on oral histories collected from 45 women, it is the first comprehensive history of a working-class lesbian community. These poignant and complex stories provide a look at black and white working-class lesbians as powerful agents of historical change. Their creativity and resilience under oppressive circumstances constructed a better life for all lesbians and expanded possibilities for all women.<br> <br> Based on 13 years of research, <b></b><b><i>Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold</i></b> ranges over topics including sex, relationships, coming out, butch-fem roles, motherhood, aging, racism, work, oppression, and pride. Kennedy and Davis provide a unique insider's perspective on butch-fem culture, and trace the roots of gay and lesbian liberation to the determined resistance of working-class lesbians. The book begins by focusing on the growth and development of community, culture, and consciousness in the bars and open house parties of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. It goes on to explore the code of personal behavior and social imperative in butch-fem culture, centering on dress, mannerisms, and gendered sexuality. Finally the book examines serial monogamy, the social forces which shaped love and break-ups, and the changing nature and content of lesbian identity.<br> <br> Capturing the full complexity of lesbianculture, this outstanding book includes extensive quotes from narrators that make every topic a living document, a composite picture of the lives of real people fighting for respect and for a place that would be safe for their love.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>This first ethnography on the development of working-class lesbian communities from the 1930s to the 1960s focuses on a Buffalo, New York, lesbian community. Unlike gay men, gay women, by dressing the way they wanted, going to bars regularly, being financially independent from their families of origin and from men, and by boldly seeking out the company of other women like themselves, unwittingly created a community of their own. The authors argue that because the women in the community gave one another the support necessary to respond aggressively and ``with pride'' when facing an often disapproving and hostile society, they effectively built the real foundation of the gay and lesbian liberation movement. The oral histories of 45 women tell of victimization by their families, straight men, and one another but also recount the joys these women experienced by allowing themselves to be who they really were. Conducted over a 13-year period, these interviews contribute a massive amount of original research to the anthropology of American culture as well as to lesbian history.

Yet To A Great Extent The Feminist And Disability Communities Have Failed To Form A Significant Coalition Or Even To Comprehend Women's Experiences Of Disability. Written From Barbara Hillyer's Perspective As A Teacher Of Feminist Theory And The Mother Of A Young Woman With Multiple Disabilities, Feminism And Disability Blends Personal, Political, And Intellectual Insights To Enrich Both Feminist Theory And Disability Theory. It Explores Issues Of Vital Concern To Women With Disabilities And Women Caregivers: Body Awareness, Community And Reciprocity, Fatigue, The Supposed Dichotomy Between Nature And Technology, Codependence. And Recovery Programs.^ The Ways In Which Cultural Standards Of Language, Independence, Pace, Cheerfulness, Mother-blaming, And Grief Limit Our Understanding Are Explained And Confronted. Throughout, Hillyer Advocates That Women Recognize And Integrate Weakness Along With Strength. The Text Challenges Political Movements That Emphasize Productivity And Normalization To Accommodate Some Less Heroic Aspects Of The Human Condition: That All People Need Help In Development At All Stages; That Death Is Not Always The Worst Thing That Can Happen To A Person; That Senility And Degenerative Diseases Undermine Belief In Life As A Growth Process; That Some Losses Cannot Be Restored.

So it was both fitting and ironic that, at the age of twenty-eight, she would be called on to join Vice President George Bush's staff as a media spokesperson. She stayed with Bush into his presidency, becoming the first African-American woman in history to hold the post of White House director of media relations. Like many African-Americans, Taylor was often caught in an isolated middle world, pulled to one side by her emotional and cultural needs, drawn to the other by a driving desire to excel. Hers is a deeply personal story that transcends day-to-day politics, examining the ""human"" challenges of maintaining equilibrium in a world which itself knows no true balance, an atmosphere lacking in ethnic, cultural, and gender diversity. In candid reflections on her years with Bush, Taylor describes the joyful excitement she found in her White House job, tempered by stark reminders that racial sensitivity sometimes took a back seat in the rough-and-tumble world of White House politics - where she once had to urge a speechwriter to remove the word nigger from one of Bush's speeches. Taylor, a deeply spiritual woman, discovered that friendships suffered as a result of the divisive Willie Horton controversy and she found herself torn between the Republican ideals she embraced and the very real problems encountered as a minority.",en,First Edition,"Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",22.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/00/9780385425100.jpg,Success,115.0,16.1

Her goal, she states at the outset, is to ""put forth an argument for extending the study of American literature...draw a map, so to speak, of a critical geography and use that map to open as much space for discovery, intellectual adventure, and close exploration as did the original charting of the New World--without the mandate for conquest."" Author of Beloved, The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, and other vivid portrayals of black American experience, Morrison ponders the effect that living in a historically racialized society has had on American writing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. She argues that race has become a metaphor, a way of referring to forces, events, and forms of social decay, economic division, and human panic. Her compelling point is that the central characteristics of American literature--individualism, masculinity, the insistence upon innocence coupled to an obsession with figurations of death and hell--are responses to a dark and abiding Africanist presence. Through her investigation of black characters, narrative strategies, and idiom in the fiction of white American writers, Morrison provides a daring perspective that is sure to alter conventional notions about American literature. She considers Willa Cather and the impact of race on concept and plot; turns to Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville to examine the black force that figures so significantly in the literature of early America; and discusses the implications of the Africanist presence at the heart of Huckleberry Finn. A final chapter on Ernest Hemingway is a brilliant exposition of the racial subtext that glimmers beneath the surface plots of his fiction. Written with the artistic vision that has earned her a preeminent place in modern letters, Playing in the Dark will be avidly read by Morri",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/26/9780679745426.jpg,Success,126.0,16.1

Of The Small Number Of Cases Pursued Through Campus Judicial Procedures Or Reported To The Police, Only A Fraction Result In Conviction. Why Does No One Seem To Know What To Do About The Problem Of Sexual Assault On Campus? Why Do So Few Women Report Their Assault? Why Are So Many Cases Mishandled?

Why Are Some Institutions Better Equipped To Handle The Problem, And What Is The Best Way To Handle Sexual Assault On Campus?

Pat Lloyd has spent her entire life in Kilgore - a small town off the Interstate set amidst the subtle beauty of the rolling hills and sagebrush-covered plains of the West. Known by all the townspeople as intelligent, likeable, and a bit odd, Pat works at her Pop's mercantile and fills the rest of her hours with mail order books and the solitude of day dreams. But just when Pat's existence seems settled, Alma Rose, a charming and vivacious trucker with elaborately tooled cowboy boots and a mouth that gallops ahead of her mind, rumbles off the highway and into Pat's life, changing it forever. Inspired by her passion for Alma Rose and the unforeseen intensity of desire, Pat transforms her life into a startling - and monumental - testament to the power of love. A brilliant debut novel filled with memorable characters and the vibrant spirit of the West, Alma Rose will strike a chord in the heart of every reader.",en,Second Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 2.55 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches",10.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/33/9781878067333.jpg,Success,22.0,16.1

Caplan demonstrates that while many women believe that when they fail it is their fault, their fate is more likely to be sealed by their encounter with the male environment, and by the manner in which they are tossed about by it. She aims to help women avoid self-blame and understand the real sources of their problems. Readers will find the information about the mine-field of academia for women infuriating, but the means of telling it highly entertaining. <P>Women account for more than half of all undergraduate students in the US and Canada, yet they make up only 10 per cent of faculty members at the level of full professor. What happens to women between freshman level, the tenure track, and the ensuing following professional years that keeps them out of the highest levels of academia? Paula Caplan is herself a veteran of the academic career struggle, and she sets out to explore this question with not only her own observations but also those of many women whom she has interviewed, and with a strong backing of established research. With these tools she provides a clear-eyed assessment of what women who have embarked on an academic career, and those who are considering it, may expect. <P>Forewarned is forearmed, and Caplan presents a list of the forms that the maleness of the environment take&#58; two of these are the conflict between professional and family responsibilities, and sexual harassment. In addition, her book offers advice on practical techniques of how to prepare a curriculum vitae, how to handle job interviews, and how to apply for promotions and tenure. A final chapter is a unique checklist which serves two purposes&#58; to provide guidance in a search for a woman-positive institution and to give suggestions for ways individual women, and women in groups, can work to improve the situation at their own institutions.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Provides strategic information and survival skills based on the experiences of the author and the wealth of existing literature on women in academia, and on hundreds of women interviewed. The focus is on graduate students and faculty, although much of the material is applicable elsewhere. The author discusses the unwritten rules, what is sexual discrimination, what can be done about it, and daily survival strategies. No index. Paper edition (unseen) $18.95. Annotation c.

Millions Of Fans Thrill To The Sound, Smell And Electricity Of The Game; A Game Associated With Men. But Unknown To Many, Young Women Played The Game, As Hard And As Well As Most Men, At A Time When Many Men Were Away At War. They Could Routinely Hit 240-foot Home Runs, Slide Into Bases, Skirts Flying And Bare Thighs Burning Raw Into The Dirt. They Were The All-american Girls Professional Baseball League. In Girls Of Summer, Lois Browne Tells Their Story - A Colorful Chronicle Of A Forgotten League, As Recalled By The Very Women And Men Who Were A Part Of It All. In 1943, It Was Philip K. Wrigley, The Great Chewing-gum Mogul, Whose Idea Of Women Playing Professional Baseball Grew Into The All-american League. The Women Who Answered His Recruiters' Call Came From All Over The U.s.^ And Canada; Young Women Who Normally Would Not Work In Jobs Reserved For Men, Let Alone Play A Man's Game. But This Was War-time 1940s, When Rosie The Riveter - The Symbol Of A Woman's Ability To Do A Man's Work - Was All The Rage. Baseball Offered Bankable Money, And An Escape From Dead-end Jobs And One-horse Towns. There Was Mary Bonnie Baker, The Well-groomed Stylish Player Who Embodied The Virtues Of The All-american; Alma Gabby Ziegler, The Great Morale Booster And Captain Of The Grand Rapids Chicks; And Dorothy Kammie Kamenshek, Who Was Rated The Best All-round Player In The League. They Were All Superb Athletes, But Their All-male Managers Expected Them To Be More.^ They Were Expected To Be Perfect Ladies; They Had Chaperones Directing Their Every Move; Feminine Uniforms That Included A Knee-length Skirt; And To Top It All Off - Charm School, Directed By None Other Than Helena Rubinstein, Who, With Her Chain Of Beauty Salons, Was Synonymous With The Feminine Ideal. Through All This, The All-american Was A Magnificent Success. In Its Heyday, Stadiums Packed In Fans And Players Were Shipped Off To Spring Training In Cuba And Florida. But It Disappeared As Quickly As It Had Appeared. Like The Phenomenon Of Women Working At Men's Jobs Outside The Home During The War, Women's Professional Baseball Fell From Favor After The War, And By 1954 Had Vanished. The All-american League Lasted For Eleven Years, And During That Time Was Transformed From Softball To The Purest Form Of Baseball.

In <i>Made From This Earth</i>, Vera Norwood explores the relationship of women to the natural environment through the work of writers, illustrators, landscape and garden designers, ornithologists, botanists, biologists, and conservationists.<p>Norwood begins by showing that the study and promotion of botany was an activity deemed appropriate for women in the early 1800s. After highlighting the work of nineteenth-century scientific illustrators and garden designers, she focuses on nature's advocates such as Rachel Carson and Dian Fossey who differed strongly with men on both women's nature and the value of the natural world. These women challenged the dominant, male-controlled ideologies, often framing their critique with reference to values arising from the female experience. Norwood concludes with an analysis of the utopian solutions posed by ecofeminists, the most recent group of women to contest men over the meaning and value of nature.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>In this thoroughly researched and readable book, Norwood, an associate professor of American studies, interprets the contributions of American women to nature study and environmental protection as exemplars of a gender-based ethical relationship to the natural world. Surveying the 19th century, her early chapters pay tribute to the neglected nature essays of Susan Fenimore Cooper and the unrecognized accomplishments of women in their fields of scientific illustration and landscape design. The pivotal chapter on Rachel Carson presents her ecological understanding as the culmination of the domestic theme of nature. Later chapters explore the wildlife careers of women ethologists and the portrayal of nature by women novelists. Norwood concludes with an examination of the current eco-feminist movement.

Marleen Barr Issues An Urgent Call For A Corrective, For The Recognition Of A New Meta- Or Supergenre Of Contemporary Writing - Feminist Fabulation - Which Includes Both Acclaimed Mainstream Works And Works Which Today's Critics Consistently Denigrate Or Ignore. In Its Investigation Of The Relationship Between Women Writers And Postmodern Fiction In Terms Of Outer Space And Canonical Space, Feminist Fabulation Is A Pioneer Vehicle Built To Explore Postmodernism In Terms Of Female Literary Spaces Which Have Something To Do With Real-world Women. Branding The Postmodern Canon As A Masculinist Utopia And A Nowhere For Feminists, Barr Offers The Stunning Argument That Feminist Science Fiction Is Not Science Fiction At All But Is Really Metafiction About Patriarchal Fiction. Barr's Concern Is Directed Every Bit As Much Toward Contemporary Feminist Critics As It Is Toward Patriarchy. Rather Than Trying To Reclaim Lost Feminist Writers Of The Past, She Suggests, Feminist Criticism Should Concentrate On Reclaiming The Present's Lost Fabulative Feminist Writers, Writers Steeped In Nonpatriarchal Definitions Of Reality Who Can Guide Us Into Another Order Of World Altogether. Barr Offers Very Specific Plans For New Structures That Will Benefit Women, Feminist Theory, Postmodern Theory, And Science Fiction Theory Alike. Feminist Fabulation Calls For A New Understanding Which Enables The Canon To Accommodate Feminist Difference And Emphasizes That The Literature Called Feminist Sf Is An Important Site Of Postmodern Feminist Difference. Barr Forces The Reader To Rethink The Whole Country Club Of Postmodernism, Not Just Its Membership List - And In So Doing Provides A Discourse Of This Century Worthy Of A Prominent Reading By All Scholars, Feminists, Writers, And Literary Theorists And Critics.

Griselda Pollock challenges art history's usual interpretations of this search in the distant and exotic regions by arguing that these artists were cultural colonizers. They exhibited the modern tourist's attachment to home - modern Paris and its art worlds - while being fascinated by what they imagined was a pre-modern ""other."" Through a thorough textual and social reading of Gauguin's 1892 painting of his Tahitian wife, Manao Tupapau, the author proposes a new theory about the avant-garde as a series of gambits, a game of reference, deference and difference. This painting refers and defers to Manet's Olympia (1863), a notorious avant-garde image of prostitution in the modern city. Where it was seen to differ was in the color of the nude: critics named it a ""brown Olympia."" Careful deconstruction of this epithet allows Professor Pollock to explore the ways in which racist discourse structures art and art history, posing questions of cultural, sexual and ethnic difference in order to make us all self-critical, not only in regard to the gender, but also to the color of art history.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",22.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/50/9780500550250.jpg,Success,75.0,16.1

For Most Americans, These Are The Familiar, Comfortable Images Of The Disabled: Benign, Helpless, Even Heroic, Struggling Against All Odds And Grateful For The Kindness Of Strangers. Yet No Set Of Images Could Be More Repellent To People With Disabilities. In No Pity: People With Disabilities Forging A New Civil Rights Movement, Joe Shapiro Of U.s. News & World Report Tells Of A Political Awakening Few Nondisabled Americans Have Even Imagined. There Are Over 43 Million Disabled People In This Country Alone; For Decades Most Of Them Have Been Thought Incapable Of Working, Caring For Themselves, Or Contributing To Society.^ But During The Last Twenty-live Years, They, Along With Their Parents And Families, Have Begun To Recognize That Paraplegia, Retardation, Deafness, Blindness, Aids, Autism, Or Any Of The Hundreds Of Other Chronic Illnesses And Disabilities That Differentiate Them From The Able-bodied Are Not Tragic. The Real Tragedy Is Prejudice, Our Society's And The Medical Establishment's Refusal To Recognize That The Disabled Person Is Entitled To Every Right And Privilege America Can Offer. No Pity's Chronicle Of Disabled People's Struggle For Inclusion, From The Seventeenth-century Deaf Communities On Martha's Vineyard To The Enactment Of The Americans With Disabilities Act Of 1992, Is Only Part Of The Story. Joe Shapiro's Five Years Of In-depth Reporting Have Uncovered Many Personal Stories As Well.^ You Will Read Of Larry Mcafee; Most Americans, Assuming That A Quadriplegic's Life Was Not Worth Living, Supported His Decision To Commit Suicide Rather Than Cope With A System That Denied Him The Right To Work Or Make His Own Decisions. Here, Too, Is The Story Of Nancy Cleaveland, A Fifty-two-year-old Woman With Retardation Who Was Forced To Go To Court To Win The Right To Live With Her Boyfriend. And Finally, You Will Read About Jim, Whose Long Road To Release From A Minnesota Mental Institution, With Shapiro's Help, Provides A Model Of What Is Wrong - And, Occasionally, Right - With America's Social-service System. Joe Shapiro's Brilliant Political And Human-interest Reporting Will Change Forever The Way We See People With Disabilities; All Who Read No Pity Will Recognize That Disability Rights Is An Issue Whose Time Has Come.

Set in the southern region of Chiapas where Castellanos was born, City of Kings [Ciudad Real] explores the centuries-old domination of indigenous people by whites, and the complex relationship between conquerors and conquered that is its outcome. Each story weaves into the next to present a portrait of the men, women and children of the region, with their hopes, tragedies, beliefs and fears. Most of all, City of Kings reveals the pain and damage suffered by both the weak and the strong when exploitation is the basis for everyday life.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>These short stories, first published in Mexico in 1960, show Castellanos to be a first-rate writer whose understanding of Mexican culture is as disturbing as it is engrossing. Using the city of Ciudad Real--the eponymous City of Kings, once glorious but now ``a vain, empty shell''--as a unifying element, she explores how racism, hunger, religion and money become weapons for the rulers of a society built upon the domination of native peoples. An elderly woman bludgeons an Indian to death, but calms her fears that his spirit will haunt her by thinking, ``How could a spirit possibly appear if the body belonged to an Indian, and not to a rational person?'' A proud native tribe and its protective spirit are exterminated by Spanish oligarchs and their descendants. A baby dies of hunger, yet the doctor who allows it to happen proclaims it a victory in getting Indians to understand the value of ``white'' medicine. A subtle paradox inhabits these unrelenting stories: Castellanos (1925-1974) was herself a wealthy ladina or white woman of mixed (European and indigenous) ancestry. She manages her exposure of the racist underpinnings of society brilliantly; more than 30 years after these stories were written, the inhumanity they portray continues to chill the soul.

A proud native tribe and its protective spirit are exterminated by Spanish oligarchs and their descendants. A baby dies of hunger, yet the doctor who allows it to happen proclaims it a victory in getting Indians to understand the value of ``white'' medicine. A subtle paradox inhabits these unrelenting stories: Castellanos (1925-1974) was herself a wealthy ladina or white woman of mixed (European and indigenous) ancestry. She manages her exposure of the racist underpinnings of society brilliantly; more than 30 years after these stories were written, the inhumanity they portray continues to chill the soul.

They Left Us An Invaluable Legacy - Some Eighty Accounts Of What They Saw And Experienced. These Chronicles Range From The Sixteen-page Testimonial Of The Widow Bault, Wife Of The Concierge In Marie-antoinette's Prison, To The Ten-volume Memoirs Of The Prolific Writer Mme De Genlis; From The Dictated Life Story Of An Illiterate Peasant To Acknowledged Classics By Mme Roland And Mme De Stael. No Other Literature In The Western World Offers Such An Early Treasury Of Women Recording Their Personal Histories Within The Context Of A Great Political Cataclysm. Their Stories Describe How They Participated, Individually And Collectively, In The Revolutionary Saga And How They Sometimes Succeeded In Manipulating A Political System Designed To Exclude Them.^ Whatever Their Political Loyalties, The Women Saw Themselves As Victims, And Their Accounts Document The Connection Between Gender And Victimization. Yet They Did Not Accept Their Victimization Passively. The Memoirists Of Blood Sisters Portray Themselves As Active Participants Cheering The Revolution On Its Course Or, More Frequently, Resisting It. Marilyn Yalom Singles Out Those Who Authored The Most Unforgettable Chronicles: The Governess Of The Royal Children; The Servant Attending Marie-antoinette In Her Last Days; Robespierre's Sister, Charlotte; The Peasant Woman From The Vendee Who Fought As A Soldier; And, Of Course, Mme Roland, Whose Autobiography Has Enchanted Readers For Centuries. Aristocrats And Bourgeois Women, Royalists And Republicans, Even The Few Peasant And Working-class Women Who Left Accounts Of Their Experiences - All Were Bound Together By A Common Nightmare.^ These Compelling Human Dramas - Moving Accounts Of Survival On The Cusp Of Catastrophe - Add Suffering Faces To The Canvas Of Lofty Thinkers And Fiery Orators Who Dominate The Historiography Of The Revolution. They Tell Us What It Was Like To Suffer A Miscarriage As The Result Of A Street Demonstration, To Choose Between Nursing A Baby And Following A Husband To War, To Resist Jailers' Demands For Sexual Favors. A Tragic Note Prevails: The Sense Of Having Survived When So Many Others Perished Often Produced What We Might Now Call Survivor's Guilt. Their Testimonies, Yalom Argues, Spring From An Inner Urgency To Bear Witness For Those Who Were Sacrificed On The Revolutionary Altar. Their Writings Eloquently Attest To The Human Costs Of Radical Social Change.
