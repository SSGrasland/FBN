ABA's annual Membership Meeting on Sunday after-
noon at 4:00. ABA's fence-sitting position vis-a-vis the
war between independent bookstores and chain
stores has not done anything to cheer its (largely inde-
pendent) bookstore membership. Many see this year’s
meeting as a chance to knock ABA off that fence and
into action for independent bookstores.
This issue’s Trivia column asks a related question:
“Does ABA need bookstores — or might it function
perfectly well without them?”
Other issue highlights include an article on stra-
tegic planning — a useful tool for any bookstore facing
the challenges of the 90s; a set of suggestions for
feminist, gay/lesbian, and general independent book-
stores on using National Lesbian and Gay Book
Month to increase store visibility; a look at maintain-

(Lazara Press) who kept this column alive and thriv-
ing for the last two years despite many challenges and
also found a team of women to bring us a continuing
report on the best and most exciting feminist books
coming out of Canada.
Ann Christophersen is ready to pass the Univer-
sity Press column to its next writer. We're looking for
someone who loves the academic presses and the
challenge of keeping their titles in stock, and who
would like to do a little commentary on their books
and on trends in university publishing.
Our next issue will be the Summer Sidelines
Issue. We're working on our line-up of articles and are
looking for a piece on feminist, alternative press and
movement-based calendars, a good piece on renting
and selling videos in feminist bookstores, and, if any-
one has good success to report, an article on selling
and promoting audio books — or whatever else is
working well for you in the sidelines department.
The Sidelines Issue should arrive in mid-July. The

recognize that authors often have tight schedules and
publishers do not have unlimited promotion dollars,
I strongly suggest that you add Meristem and other
feminist bookstores, particularly in the South, to your
future tour list for feminist authors.
While many feminist bookstores are small, inde-
pendent stores, we work very hard to promote the
writers whose works we sell, largely because we be-
lieve in the importance of those works. Many authors
prefer to read and sign at Meristem and other feminist
bookstores precisely because of the personal attention
which we provide to the authors, their books and our
customers. And, we know how to sell feminist books.
As an example, Meristem sold over 200 copies of Alice

This year, l'll be attending ABA, but I will not be
representing any imprints. No, I’m not trying to con-
fuse you. My partner, Karen, after supporting me
through three years of ABA has decided that she
might like to open a small bookstore. Thus, she has
joined ABA as a Provincial Member and has asked me
to support her this year at ABA. I'll be attending under
her proposed bookstore, Foxen Books. I'm happy to
talk to publishers about Lavender Tapes and books-
on-tape when we visit the feminist and gay/lesbian
publishers’ booths, but I know yow'll be interested in
talking with Karen about bookselling. I'm really
pleased that my work within the feminist publishing
community may indirectly lead to the birth of another
feminist bookstore.
Thank you for letting me clarify my role within
the feminist publishing community. See you at ABA!

36,"Almost universally the answer was “Every month
is lesbian (or lesbian and gay) book month in our
store.” Most feminist and gay bookstores celebrate
June as Gay Pride Month and do it with books — and
have done so for years. Special lesbian/ gay pride win-
dows in June are the norm, not a new theme. Many
stores sell at gay pride events, hold special events and
readings — and that’s “business as usual” for June.
Some do a bit of additional advertising, others don’t.
Only one of the dozen or so stores we talked to reported
doing NL&GBM-inspired “hype” that increased sales.
A gay bookseller put it most succinctly: “Lesbian and
Gay Book Month is aimed at mainstream presses that
publish lesbian /gay titles and at the mainstream book-
sellers who sell them (rather than gay/lesbian press
titles). The focus is on the books themselves, rather
than on the booksellers.” A few others were less kind.
There's an appropriate and understandable irritation
when national or local media wax poetic about the
“first” gay-themed windows or a gay reading series
(giving a lot of free publicity to general stores and chain
stores) while perpetuating the blackout on coverage of
lesbian and gay institutions by ignoring feminist, les-
bian, and/or gay and lesbian bookstores that have
been doing all these things for years.
As a reality check it’s worth
remembering that NL&GBM

'ÍHE TRUTH
ABOUT FAKING IT.
No matter why we lie or to whom, Harriet Goldhor Lerner,
a leading voice in psychology and feminism, dares us to take
a closer look. Whether the subject is sexual faking or family
secrets—Lerner unravels the hidden forces that block us
from discovering and sharing our own truths.
“Stunning in its impact....This is a book to be read and
re-read as we absorb its complex implications for changing
the nature of our most intimate relationships.”
— Betty Carter, Director, Family Institute of Westchester
“A remarkable, beautifully written book
illuminating ways for women to find
integrity, courage and voice in a world
that rewards female silence and
pretense.”—Carol Tavris, author of

Nettles is a beautifully produced, autobiographical
book by a contemporary photographer — now in her

the ways in which work by a woman artist grows. $15

Grace Paley’s Life Stories
A Literary Biography
Judith Arcana
“In this engaging study, Arcana analyzes Paley’s work in terms
of its autobiographical roots, tracing her evolution from a wife
and mother into a writer and social activist who embraced
anti-Vietnam war protests, environmental and feminist causes,
and eventually gay rights efforts.” — Publishers Weekly. “Arcana
does a superb job of interrelating and integrating Paley’s life
and work, paralleling characters and dialog with life events and
ways of thinking. She gives the reader a real sense of Paley’s
spirit, personality, and development as an individual and
as a writer. . . . Highly recommended.” — Librar) Journal.
