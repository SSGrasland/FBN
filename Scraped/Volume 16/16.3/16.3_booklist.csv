So the last place on earth Arly wanted to be was back in Manhattan with its bright lights, memories of her nasty divorce ... and, doggone it anyway, a most inconvenient murder. The week started out just dandy with the social event of the season, the long-awaited marriage of lovestruck Kevin Buchanan and his sweet, his beloved, his three-hundred-pound darling, Dahlia O'Neill. As if that didn't give the gossips enough to talk about, Ruby Bee won an all-expense-paid trip to New York as a finalist in the Koko-Nut Cooking Contest, and she and Estelle were on their way to show the city folks a thing or two. But before the week ended, the newlyweds went amok on their way to Niagara Falls, and Ruby Bee, while making a big splash in the Big Apple, was in the slammer for attempted murder! Flying to the rescue just about wiped out Arly's bank account, and checking into the Chadwick Hotel almost did the same thing for her reputation. The contest had brought together some of the most unlikely characters ever to turn on a Mixmaster, and in an embarrassingly short time, Arly found herself in the room of good-looking, unmarried Durmond Pilverman, whose talents went way beyond his skill at baking a Koko-Nut Kream Pie. But when a dead body turned up in the hotel dumpster, Arly smelled something suspicious in this national cook-off. And the .38 she found hidden in Durmond's dresser had her wondering if she was in danger of sleeping with the enemy. In this sixth mystery in the highly acclaimed Maggody series, the spunky, off-beat, appealing Arly Hanks once again stars in a thoroughly original, wonderfully funny whodunit.",en,,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/66/9780451403766.jpg,Success,80.0,16.3

But every year in America, nearly four million women are beaten by their husbands or lovers. Every day, four women are killed. And who deprives these women of their constitutional right? We do. Despite shelters, support groups, and advocacy programs, the abuse of women in this country is worse than ever. Judges refuse to punish batterers, doctors send battered women home with tranquilizers, journalists describe murdered wives and girlfriends as victims of ""tragic love."" And too many friends and neighbors simply stand by, asking ""Why doesn't she just leave?"" when in fact women do leave in vast numbers, braving the loss of everything, and they are still beaten, raped, and murdered after they have gone. In her powerful new book, best-selling author Ann Jones explains how we unwittingly encourage violence against women in America and how we can change our ways. She exposes the dangerous stereotypes we all share, habits of mind that warp our views and skew our responses to male violence against women. Unlike other studies of domestic violence that focus mainly on battered women, this book looks at the attitudes and institutions that foster the problem. Citing numerous recent cases, Jones shows that judges, police, journalists, doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, clergy, academic ""experts,"" and even many feminists still hold women responsible for appeasing men and absorbing their violence. Compelling chapters show how America's legal system denies women's rights, leaving women unprotected. Jones takes a hard look at the language we use when we talk about men beating women - language that tends to shift the blame to women and exonerate the men who beat them. She shows us how pop psychology and pop culture - movies, songs, TV shows - confuse anger and violence with love, implying that assault in a ""domestic"" setting is somehow different, somehow tolerable, and still somehow women's fault.

That message dominates this lengthy lyric meditation, a fragmentary collage in which the feminist Griffin ( Woman and Nature ) jumps disjointedly from the fire-bombing of Dresden to her discovery that her grandfather was an alcoholic. Mixing history, myth and memoir, this kaleidoscopic work contains passages of striking power along with dazzling character sketches: Kaiser Wilhelm II riding a white horse through the streets of Tangier; Gandhi heeding his inner voices; Nazi Heinrich Himmler, as a boy, repeating classmates' confidences to his schoolmaster father; Werner von Braun designing rockets in Alabama; General MacArthur trying to impress his mother with his heroism.

But because of his reclusive, introspective nature, Toomer's fame waned in later years, and today his other contributions to American thought and literature are all but forgotten. Now, this collection of unpublished writings restores a crucial dimension to our understanding of this important African American author.

Rusch highlights Toomer's reflections on America, its people, landscape, and politics, reveals his significance for the problems and issues of today, and helps us understand Toomer not only as writer, but also as social critic, prophet, mystic, and idealist.

Even so, he made her join the rest of his family as they shared his exile on the island of Jersey. Adèle was virtually imprisoned. The lack of outlets for her artistic gifts cramped her mind, and daily seances loosened her grip on reality. No wonder she fell in love with a feckless English soldier, Albert Andrew Pinson. His ardour for everything about her except her money cooled rapidly, but her passion for him burned white hot. Adèle dogged Pinson's footsteps, first to Halifax and then to Barbados, sometimes in a state of dementia. At last, a former slave rescued her from a Bridgetown street and took her home to France. Victor committed Adèle to an asylum, and there she stayed for the rest of her life, even though she was at times no less lucid than he.",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/80/9780864921680.jpg,Success,71.0,16.3

0-89862-017-1,On the Shoulders of Women: The Feminization of Psychotherapy,"Philipson, Ilene J.",The Guilford Press,177.0,1993-08-13,,Hardcover,"While Men And Women Used To Enter The Field Of Psychotherapy At An Almost Equal Rate, The Past 15 Years Have Seen A Drastic Shift: Statistics Clearly Show That Women Are Entering The Mental Health Professions In Huge Numbers At The Same Time That The Incoming Number Of Men Is On The Decline. Although There Has Been Little Professional Acknowledgment, It Is Apparent That Psychotherapy Is Undergoing A Fundamental Transformation Into An All-women's Field. This Volume Presents A Brilliant And Impassioned Analysis Of This Dramatic Alteration. On The Shoulders Of Women Demonstrates That The Feminization Of Psychotherapy Will Have Lasting Effects On The Theories Guiding The Work Of Psychotherapists Within The Consulting Room, Their Views Of Psychopathology And Human Development, And Even The Techniques And Goals Of Psychotherapeutic Practice. In A Provocative Discussion, This Volume Reveals The Ways The Current Paradigm Shift In Psychoanalysis - From Drive Theory To A Relational Model - Is Deeply Embedded In The Gender Recomposition Of The Field. Just As Women Represented The Other In The Traditional Freudian Paradigm, Which Had Its Roots In The Patriarchal Family Of Late Nineteenth-century Vienna And Was Practiced Largely By Men, So Now Men May Be Approaching A Similar Status Within The Emerging Relational Model.. The Author Asserts That The Implications Of The Feminization Of Psychotherapy Go Even Further, Transcending The Boundaries Of Clinical Theory And Practice Altogether. There Is Little Question That Psychotherapy Is Currently A Field In Crisis: Professional Publications Tell Of The Recent Mental Health Care Revolution, In Which Public And Private Sector Funding And Support For Both Short- And Long-term Psychotherapeutic Care Are Declining Rapidly. Ironically, While The Prestige And Financial Rewards To Be Gained In The Field Of Psychotherapy Appear To Be Decreasing, The Overall Number Of New Psychotherapists Has Grown. On The Shoulders Of Women Maintains That The Fate Of Psychotherapy And Its Increasingly Female Body Of Practitioners Speaks To Our Society's Devaluation Of Care-giving In General And Women's Identification With This Arena Of Life. Describing How The Public And Private Sectors Withdraw Support And Observe From A Distance The Single Mother, The Inner-city School Teacher, And The Woman Psychotherapist, Forcing Each To Work Under Increasingly Adverse Circumstances, The Author Demonstrates That The Responsibility For Tending To The Well-being Of Children, The Elderly, And The Mentally Ill Has Come To Rest More And More On Women's Shoulders Alone. Finally, This Volume Points Out That What Is Occurring In The Field Of Psychotherapy Reveals A Disturbing Trend That Haunts Our National Priorities, Our Collective Sense Of Social Welfare, And Our Deeply Gendered Notions Of Who Carries Out The Responsibilities Of Tending To Our Emotional Pain And Under What Conditions.. Presenting An Unerringly Accurate Analysis Of Developments That Will Have Far-reaching Consequences, The Book Is Invaluable To All Mental Health Practitioners And Those Interested In Women's Issues. Offering A Wealth Of Important Information In A Highly Readable Style, On The Shoulders Of Women Will Also Illuminate The Work Of Feminist Scholars, Sociologists, Historians, And Students In These Areas.--book Jacket.

For I Do Want It To Be Read - There Is No Use Concealing The Fact - By Somebody Who Is Like Me, Who Would Understand. Jeb Alexander Was A Gay Man Who Lived In Washington, D.c., During The First Half Of The Twentieth Century. From 1918, When He Was Nineteen Years Old, Until The Late 1950s, He Chronicled His Daily Life Engagingly And Unsparingly, Leaving Behind A Unique Record Of Ordinary Gay Life Before Stonewall, A History That Has Remained Largely Hidden Until Now. Jeb Came Of Age As The Century Did, Witnessing And Recording Political And Social Change From The Position Of Insider As An Editor For The U.s. Government And Outsider As A Gay Man. Painfully Shy, And Frustrated In His Ambition To Be A Novelist By Writer's Block, Jeb Turned To His Diary As A Way Of Expressing Himself As Well As Recording Events, Creating A Full Emotional Self-portrait And Unforgettable Sketches Of The Men Who Made Up His Lively Circle Of Friends. Jeb And Dash Also Details The Joy And Anguish Of An Extraordinary On-and-off Love Affair Between Jeb And C.c.

Almost perversely, Krauss argues, Sherman's unsettling attempts to dissect the formation and perception of images have turned her artworks - and herself - into icons for feminists' and others' agendas. Krauss explores in depth the various approaches to Sherman's work taken by philosophers and art historians and asks if they have not often lost sight of the imagery itself - or, more specifically, the way the images are constructed. In a further essay, Norman Bryson, internationally known for his pioneering theories on the semiotics of looking, explores Sherman's most recent, horror-show images of mannequins (known as the Sex Pictures) and identifies their place in her continued out-of-body investigations. Along with a bibliography and chronology, more than 200 illustrations (140 in color), including numerous unpublished works, represent Sherman's complete career to date.",en,First Edition,"Height: 12.75 Inches, Length: 9.25 Inches, Weight: 3.6 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",60.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/66/9780847817566.jpg,Success,16.0,16.3

From Alexis de Tocqueville to Jack Kerouac and William Least Heat Moon, writers in search of America have taken to the road. Journalist and gay activist Darrell Yates Rist is just such a pioneer, and Heartlands records his unique journey of exploration, a quest for the real gay America beyond the stereotypes of the popular media. In his hundred-thousand-mile odyssey down the ""blue highways"" of gay life, Rist seeks out America's rural communities, urban neighborhoods, farms, bars, clubs, and churches to record the lives of the nation's gay people. While this is richly detailed and wonderfully appealing travel writing on one level, his portrait of gay America takes twists and turns into memories and desires, and into the deepest regions of the human heart. From a drag queen in Mississippi to a rough-hewn cowboy at the Denver Gay Rodeo, from an alligator trapper in Louisiana to an oil worker on Alaska's pipeline, Rist describes the lives of gay men from every walk of life. These are ordinary men leading ordinary lives, yet constantly having to face everything from mild discrimination to outright bigotry and violence, as well as one of history's most devastating diseases. The stories of such heroic people easily defy all preconceived notions of what constitutes gay life in America. An important social and political work, Heartlands reveals gay life as it really is: the hopes and the dreams, the disappointments and the triumphs, the pains and the joys of a varied yet always vital culture. A keen observer and a consummate writer, Rist paints a deeply personal, often wrenching portrait of a group of individuals as diverse as the vast topography of America itself.

                        <p>From a drag queen to a rough-hewn cowboy, Rist describes the lives of gay men from every walk of life. These are ordinary men leading ordinary lives, yet constantly having to face everything from mild discrimination to outright bigotry and violence, as well as one of history's most devastating diseases.

Noted health writer Susan Perry teams up with gynecologic cancer specialist Dr. Katherine O'Hanlan of the Stanford University Medical Center to offer a reassuring look at menopause as a natural passage in life, not a disease--without minimizing the discomforts or problems that many women experience. Their central message is that good nutrition, a good exercise program, and, yes, even good sex are the best prescriptions for a trouble-free menopause. And that HRT carries significant health risks and should be taken by menopausal women only as a last resort. Natural Menopause emphasizes the natural strengths, the natural beauty, the natural healing, and the longevity of women--and gives you the facts about everything from osteoporosis and heart disease to hot flashes and mood swings and how menopause will affect your sexuality. It offers basic information every woman should have before she sees the gynecologist--and certainly before she makes any decisions about a regimen of hormone therapy. Natural Menopause is the one accurate, complete, up-to-date book that every woman should have on this subject--a balanced, comprehensive, and responsible look at a stage of women's lives that has remained so mysterious, misunderstood, and controversial.",en,Rep,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 0.5 Inches, Weight: 0.71429772888 Pounds, Width: 6 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/79/9780201624779.jpg,Success,119.0,16.3

2-08013-536-8,History of Men's Fashion,"Chenoune, Farid",Flammarion,338.0,1996-06-15,,Hardcover,"A History of Men's Fashion is divided into four parts that follow the sartorial evolution of the male wardrobe from the era of Beau Brummell, which created the model of the gentlemen and the dandy, to the ""anti-fashion"" trends of the early 1990s. Part One (1760-1850) traces the era of tails and the frock coat, the emergence of the pantaloon and the influence of Anglomania on European fashion. Men's fashion in Europe's fin de siecle climate, and the impact of ready-made garments are discussed in Part Two (1850-1914). Part Three (1914-1940) introduces the aesthetic of the sweater and the variations on the suit and vest as part of the post-World War I moral liberation and economic euphoria, and traces changes all the way through to the New Deal and the new American elegance. The post-World War II fashion revolution is described in Part Four (1940-1990) from zoot suits, spurred by the black American jazz scene, to London's Mod fashion of the 60s, Pierre Cardin and the new French style, the emergence of Italian chic, and the hippie and punk styles of the 70s. The book is completed by a perceptive discussion of contemporary designers such as Jean-Paul Gaultier, Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren, Comme des Garcons, and Yohji Yamamoto. Farid Chenoune's lively and accessible text is filled with amusing anecdotes about male dress and grooming. He vividly places style transformations in the context of contemporary fashion criticism, history, social etiquette, manufacturing and marketing revolutions, and highlights public and private responses to fashion trends. By analyzing fashion's symbolic, social, and economic frames of reference he lays before us the entire fabric of the intellectual, spiritual, and material forces of the modern era. The copious illustrations for this book, many reproduced here for the first time, are drawn from fashion designs, paintings, drawings, cartoons, tailor's model books, magazines, and rare, impromptu photographs of masculine style in city stree",en,First Edition,"Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 4.5 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",75.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/60/9782080135360.jpg,Success,73.0,16.3

The Slow Natives takes place on that familiar battleground where middle age and adolescence confront each other, in a climate of hostile bewilderment, contempt, and reluctant love. At its center are music teacher Bernard Leverson, bored with his job and his marriage; his wife, Iris, who is engaged listlessly in an affair; and their rebellious teenage son, Keith. Their path leads inevitably to tragedy, but also presses the Leversons toward a reappreciation of their lives and one another.

This ambitious collection of more than fifty coming of age stories pairs selections by teenagers with older writers' reflections on growing up gay or lesbian. Fiction by James Baldwin, Rita Mae Brown, and Jeanette Winterson counterpoints autobiographical pieces by Quentin Crisp, Audre Lorde, and Paul Monette; diary accounts of growing up gay in the 1980s and 1990s complement poems, stories, and oral histories that tell what it was like to come of age as a gay man or lesbian in the 1940s and 1950s, when the notion of gay liberation was a distant prospect indeed. Topics include discovering one's sexual identity, entering into friendships and relationships, and finding a place within the sometimes hostile, sometimes welcoming worlds of school, family, work, faith, and community. Central to the book are the voices of young people struggling with how it feels to be part of a largely invisible and often misunderstood minority.

Yet Menstrual Blood Is Never Mentioned And Almost Never Seen, Except Privately By Women. A Girl's First Period Is Usually Kept Secret, A Source Of Embarrassment And Irritation. Menstruation In Our Culture Is Invisible And Irrelevant If Properly Hidden, Shameful And Unclean If Not. It Was Not Always This Way. Long Ago, In Cultures Around The World, A Girl's Menarchal Passage Was A Time Of Celebration And Initiation, And A Time For Ceremony, Often Including Special Clothing And Foods And A Period Of Seclusion. Far More Than A Biological Event, Menstruation Was A Recognized Mark Of Female Power, A Source Of Ritual And Of Awe. The Influence Of Early Menstrual Rites Remains Visible In Our Culture Today.^ According To Judy Grahn, The Ancient Rites Explain Much Of Contemporary Material Culture - Why Women Wear Lipstick And Eye Makeup And Adorn Themselves With Earrings And Hair Clasps, Or Why Forks, Bowls, Chairs, Rugs, And Shoes Originated, For Instance. But Grahn Also Reveals The Profound Connections Between Ancient Menstrual Rites And The Development Of Agriculture, Mathematics, Geometry, Writing, Calendars, Horticulture, Architecture, Astronomy, Cooking, Money, And Many Other Realms Of Knowledge. Blending Archaeological Data, Ethnography, Folklore, History, And Myth, She Constructs A New Myth Of Origin For Us All, Demonstrating That Menstruation Is What Made Us Human. Blood, Bread, And Roses Reclaims Woman's Myths And Stories, Chronicling The Ways In Which Women's Actions And The Teaching Of Myth Have Interacted Over The Millennia. Grahn Argues That Culture Has Been A Weaving Between The Genders, A Sharing Of Wisdom Derived From Menstruation.^ Her Rich Interpretations Of Ancient Menstrual Rites Give Us A New And Hopeful Story Of Culture's Beginnings Based On The Integration Of Body, Mind, And Spirit Found Women's Traditions. Blood, Bread, And Roses Offers All Of Us A Way Back To Understanding The True Meaning Of Women's Menstrual Power. Foreword / Charlene Spretnak -- Preface: All Blood Is Menstrual Blood -- 1. Blood ...

Initially conceived as notes toward a screenplay for <I>The Lover</I>, this later novel, written toward the end of her life, emphasizes the tougher aspects of her youth in Indochina and possesses the intimate feel of a documentary.<br>Both shocking and enthralling, the story Duras tells is ""so powerfully imagined (or remembered) that it...lingers like a strong perfume"" (<I>Publishers Weekly</I>). Hailed by the French critics as a return to ""the Duras of the great books and the great days,"" it is a mature and complex rendering of a formative period in the author's life.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The veteran French author, who scored a considerable success with The Lover, here zeroes in much more closely on the passionate affair between her young self, a French teenager at a school in Indo-China in the early 1930s, and the spoiled young son of a Chinese millionaire. Beginning as bare notes toward a film script (Duras wrote the script for Hiroshima, Mon Amour), the story quickly takes on its own intense, exotic flavor. The febrile sexuality of the young girls at the school, the languid emotionalism of the Chinese lover, the splendid cars, the melancholy American dance music, the open roads across the rice paddies under wide rainy skies, the cinemas and nightclubs, and finally the ocean liner that takes her tragic family back to F'rance-Duras evokes all this with the utmost economy but the most telling atmospheric force. No doubt her lean, haunting prose reads even more beautifully in the original French, but Duras's story is so powerfully imagined (or remembered) that its blend of passion and cynicism lingers like a strong perfume. Irresistible for grownup romantics.

Promoted by Cold War liberals&#151;that is, liberals who wanted to perserve the legacies of the New Deal but also wished to separate liberalism from a Communist-dominated cultural politics&#151;this consensus was grounded in the perceived threat that Communists, lesbians, and homosexuals posed to national security. Through an analysis of the films of Alfred Hitchcock, combined with new research on the historical context in which these films were produced, Corber shows how Cold War liberals tried to contain the increasing heterogeneity of American society by linking questions of gender and sexual identity directly to issues of national security, a strategic move that the films of Hitchcock both legitimated and at times undermined. Drawing on psychoanalytic and Marxist theory, Corber looks at such films as <i>Rear Window, Strangers on a Train,</i> and <i>Psycho</i> to show how Hitchcock manipulated viewers' attachments and identifications to foster and reinforce the relationship between homophobia and national security issues.<br>&#9;A revisionary account of Hitchcock's major works, <i>In the Name of National Security</i> is also of great interest for what it reveals about the construction of political &quot;reality&quot; in American history.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Argues that after World War II, liberals achieved and retained hegemony over American society by producing a united cultural front that incorporated the interests of women, gays, and ethnic minorities and also organized them into an apparently united struggle against communism. Draws on the films of Alfred Hitchcock during the 1950s to show the inherent contradictions of the illusion that led to its collapse in the 1960s. Paper edition (unseen), $16.95. Annotation c.

But, Until Now, Scant Attention Has Been Paid To What Is Perhaps The Most Mysterious--and Potentially Illuminating--variation Of Human Sexual Expression, Bisexuality. Today, As Ignorance And Fear Of Aids Makes Greater Awareness Of All Forms Of Sexual Behavior An Urgent Matter Of Private And Public Consequence, Leading Sex Researchers Martin Weinberg, Colin Williams, And Douglas Pryor Provide Us With The First Major Study Of Bisexuality. Weinberg, Williams, And Pryor Explore The Riddle Of Dual Attraction In Their Study Of 800 Residents Of San Francisco. Fieldwork, Intensive Interviews, And Surveys Provided A Wealth Of Data About The Nature Of Bisexual Attraction, The Steps That Lead People To Become Bisexual, And How Sexual Preference Can Change Over Time.^ They Found That Heterosexuals, More Often Than Homosexuals, Become Bisexual; That Bisexual Men And Women Differ Markedly In Their Sexual Behavior And Romantic Feelings; That Most Bisexuals Ultimately Settle Into Long-term Relationships While Continuing Sexual Activity Outside Those Relationships; And They Also Explain Why Transsexuals Often Become Bisexual. Moreover, The Authors Discovered That As The Aids Crisis Unfolded, Many Bisexual Men Entered Into Monogamous Relationships With Women, And Bisexual Women Into More Lesbian Relationships. Recent Media Accounts Attest That A Growing Number Of Researchers And Writers Are Narrowing The Fundamental Cause Of Sexual Preference To A Single Factor, Biology.^ But If, As This Study Shows, Learning Plays A Significant Part In Helping People Traverse The Boundaries Of Gender, If Past And Present Intimate Relationships Influence Their Changing Preferences, And If Bisexual Activity Is Inseparable From A Social Environment Which Provides Distinctive Sexual Opportunities, Then A Mosaic Of Factors Far More Complex Than Those Previously Considered Must Be Entertained In Explaining The Fuller Spectrum Of Sexual Preferences. Dual Attraction Is One Of The Most Significant Contributions To Our Understanding Of Sexuality Since The Original Kinsey Reports And Bell And Weinberg's 1978 International Bestseller, Homosexualities. It Is Must Reading For All Those Interested In The Study Of Sexual Behavior--especially Now, Since The Onset Of Aids.
