0-394-58025-7,Women Lawyers: Rewriting the Rules,"Harrington, Mona",Knopf,265.0,1994-01-18,Women Lawyers,Hardcover,"The very presence of women in the law — normal as it may seem to us today — signals revolutionary change in a social order that for centuries entrusted control over its rules to men. Mona Harrington examines both the problems women meet when they claim equal authority as rule makers, and the impact of new perspectives and issues that women bring with them into the profession.
<p>On the basis of more than one hundred interviews with women lawyers, judges, law school professors, and law students, and through the stories of their daily experiences, Harrington pinpoints and analyzes the key factors holding women back in a profession still dominated by males — among them the ""men's club"" ambience, the focus on billable hours, sexual harassment and the inequality it perpetuates, lingering unequal division of labor at home, and hostile media images of women in positions of power.</p>
<p>She shows us what life is like for women lawyers in practice today and how their dilemmas reflect the social issues of our time. She gives us the voices of women who have adapted to the cultural codes of corporate law and women who have broken them; women who have successfully balanced their professional and private lives and women who feel trapped by the combination of long hours at the office and full responsibility at home. She introduces us to women in new and alternative firms, on the faculties of small public law schools, in in-house legal departments, in prosecutors' offices and courtrooms — women who are devising new rules and legal theories to bring about change.</p>
<p>Women Lawyers is must reading for every woman in the midst of — or contemplating — a career in the law, and forthe men who work with them.</p>


                        <p>Drawing on more than 100 interviews with women lawyers, judges, law school professors, and law students, Harrington pinpoints the barriers women face when they claim equal professional authority--among them the ""men's club"" ambience, the focus on billable hours, distorted media images, and sexual harassment.

0-253-20817-3,Menopause: A Midlife Passage,,Indiana University Press,240.0,1993-09-22,,Paperback,"<p>""In Menopause: A Midlife Passage, [questions about menopause] are considered in depth from a dazzling variety of angles. This is just the serious feminist discussion of menopause that I have been longing for.... its exquisite analyses renew us in our struggles to make sense of it all."" —Alice Dan, Women’s Review of Books</p>
<p>""Menopause has become a hot (with or without the flashes) topic in America. That’s because a critical mass of us have reached it and are educated, aggressive, and confident enough to want to know what’s happening to us, and then to talk about it.... Smart, useful, funny, Menopause: A Midlife Passage is a fine addition to the discussion, a healthy companion for this all-important life passage."" —Susan Stamberg, Special Correspondent, National Public Radio</p>
<p>""Editor Callahan takes anything but a trendy approach to a very trendy topic. She’s gathered essays by scholarly women who have thought through society’s position on menopause and menopausal women and don’t like what they see: older women denied positive portrayals in mainstream media, menopause treated by the medical establishment as if it were a disease rather than a natural occurrence, and devaluation of older women. Determined to change people’s minds with their words, these women speak both powerfully and empoweringly. A must for feminist and women’s health collections."" —Booklist</p>
<p>""... a bold attempt to go beyond the standard medical framing of women’s experience, and to contest the notion that the menopause is straightforwardly a hormonal ‘deficiency disease’."" —New Scientist</p>
<p>""... [an] entertaining and informative book that takes a very positive attitude toward the ‘midlife passage’."" —Fertility News</p>
<p>""This book should be required reading for all women’s health care providers and anyone else doing counseling of menopausal women."" —Journal of Women &amp; Aging</p>
<p>Essayists from various walks of life present female-defined perspectives on menopause and the passage to new physical, social, and cultural development.</p>",en,First Trade,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.661386786 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/70/9780253208170.jpg,Success,43.0,16.5

From The Tailhook Scandal To The Fall Of The Berlin Wall To The Nafta Agreement, Enloe Makes Incisive Connections - Between Demilitarization And Ideologies About Motherhood And The Family, Between Lesbians And National Security, Between The Events Out There And Women's Behavior Back Here. Focusing On The Inextricable, Sometimes Subterranean, Relationship Between The Politics Of Sexuality And The Politics Of Militarism, Enloe Links Jobs, Domestic Life, Military Networks, And International Relations. From The Salvadoran Revolutionary Who Removes Her Iud To Begin A New Life As A Wife And Mother To The Estonion Woman Who Faces Down A Fully Armed Russian Soldier, Enloe Charts New Definitions Of Gender Roles, Sexuality, And Militarism At The End Of The Twentieth Century. Emerging Nationalist Movements, While Often Viewed As Liberatory, Serve Ironically To Reestablish The Privileges Of Masculinity And Grease The Wheels Of A New Militarism. From The New States Of Eastern Europe To Kuwait To Latin America, Enloe Not Only Documents Ongoing Assaults Upon Women But Also Suggests What They Tell Us About Living In This Post-cold War Era. The Rape Of Bosnian Women And The Prostitution Around American Military Facilities Are Just Two Of The Graphic Reminders Of Women's Continuing Disenfranchisement. Other Forms Are More Subtle.

The Bauhaus defined modern design in the twentieth century. As the preeminent design phenomenon of the era, almost every aspect of it has been minutely examined. Yet the Weaving Workshop, the longest standing and most successful of all Bauhaus workshops, has been neglected for one simple reason: when the first wave of brilliantly talented women arrived at the school, they soon discovered that Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius could not sustain his ringing declaration of equality between ""the beautiful and the strong gender."" Textiles, in the hierarchy of art and design, were to be ""women's work."" Their results, however, were remarkable, both in the early days of artistic expression in Weimar and in later developments in the textile industry. The craftswomen responded to the demands of advanced technology with fabrics that incorporated new or unusual materials such as Cellophane, leather and early synthetics, which had acoustic and light-reflecting properties. They produced multi-layered fabrics, cloths with double and triple weaves, and later made extensive use of the jacquard loom. The result was a rebirth of hand-weaving and new professionalism in designing textiles for mass production. In this model study, superlatively documented with rare or little-seen photographs of the textiles and their makers, Sigrid Wortmann Weltge captures the heady atmosphere of creative excitement at the Bauhaus. Original archival research and interviews, both with survivors and their students and with leading contemporary designers, detail the workshop's history and its enduring legacy. When the Nazis closed the institution in 1933, its members dispersed to Switzerland, Holland, England, France, Russia, Mexico, and throughout the United",en,,"Height: 11.5 Inches, Length: 9.25 Inches, Weight: 2.85 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",36.02,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/60/9780811804660.jpg,Success,70.0,16.5

A computer hacker reprograms a switching station, and calls to a Florida probation office are shunted to a New York phone-sex hotline. An underground computer bulletin board publishes a pilfered BellSouth document on the 911 emergency system, making it available to anyone who dials up. How did so much illicit power reach the hands of an undisciplined few - and what should be done about it? You are about to descend into a strange netherworld - one that sprang into existence when computers were first connected to telephones. This place has no physical location; it exists only in the networks that bind together its population. Like any frontier, it is home to a wide range of personalities, from legitimate computer professionals to those known only by their noms de net; denizens like Knight Lightning, Leftist, Compu-Phreak, Major Havoc, and Silver Spy; groups like the Lords of Chaos, Phantom Access Associates, Shadow Brotherhood, and the Coalition of Hi-Tech Pirates. This is not normal space, but cyberspace. And if you use a computer, cyberspace is moving inexorably closer to you with each passing day. Your guide on this journey is bestselling science fiction author and longtime computer user Bruce Sterling, who was galvanized into action following the massive hacker crackdowns of 1990, in which law enforcement officers executed search warrants across the country against lawbreakers - and suspected lawbreakers - in the computer underground. In The Hacker Crackdown, Sterling - respected by hackers, law officers, and civil libertarians alike - uses his unique reportorial access and his considerable powers as a novelist to weave a startling narrative that informs, compels, and appalls. Sterling has researched all corners of this challenging and controversial new world for this book. In it we meet outlaws and cops, bureaucrats and rebels, geniuses and grifters: all denizens of a dazzling e</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Cyberpunk novelist Sterling (Involution Ocean) has produced by far the most stylish report from the computer outlaw culture since Steven Levy's Hackers. In jazzy New Journalism proE;e, sounding like Tom Wolfe reporting on a gunfight at the Cybernetic Corral, Sterling makes readers feel at home with the hackers, marshals, rebels and bureaucrats of the electronic frontier. He opens with a social history of the telephone in order to explain how the Jan. 15, 1990, crash of AT&T's long-distance switching system led to a crackdown on high-tech outlaws suspected of using their knowledge of eyberspace to invade the phone company's and other corporations' supposedly secure networks. After explaining the nature of eyberspace forms like electronic bulletin boards in detail, Sterling makes the hackers-who live in the ether between terminals under noms de nets such as VaxCat-as vivid as Wyatt Earp and Doe Holliday. His book goes a long way towards explaining the emerging digital world and its ethos.

At the same time, cinema was emerging as the newest and most accessible form of popular entertainment, and as a powerful tool in propagandizing the Party line. This book looks at the interaction between these two phenomena: at the extent to which women's new status and roles were reflected and promoted on Soviet screens throughout the country's history. Part I, written by Lynne Attwood, provides an essential framework for readers unfamiliar with Soviet studies. It offers a lucid and lively account of the milestones in Soviet history, the importance of film within this history and the changing images and experiences of Soviet women within both cinema and society. In Parts II and III, women from the former Soviet Union - film critics, directors, camera-operators and script-writers - relate their own experiences in the film industry, and their responses to the images of women portrayed on screen.

History books do not record the contribution of his mysterious collaborator, ""M.E.P.,"" but in Free Enterprise, acclaimed novelist Michelle Cliff tells the remarkable story of frontier legend Mary Ellen Pleasant. In 1858, two black women meet at a restaurant and begin to plot a revolution. Mary Ellen Pleasant owns a string of hotels in San Francisco that cater to wealthy whites and secretly double as havens for runaway slaves. Her comrade, Annie, is a young Jamaican who has given up her life of privilege to fight for the abolitionist cause. Together they join John Brown's doomed enterprise, and barely escape with their lives.

                        <p>In 1858, two black women meet and later join John Brown's doomed raid on Harper's Ferry, barely escaping with their lives. Acclaimed author Michelle Cliff places an actual historical figure at the center of her powerful new novel, which brings to life the passionate struggle for liberation that began not long after the first slavers landed in Virginia.

<p>In it Penelope Leach calls on us as individuals and as a nation to make good on the promise of our endless rhetoric about the importance of family by creating the indispensable economic and social supports for children that are now so tragically missing.</p>
<p>She asks us — in our legislation, in our policy-making, in our industrial might — to think of children first and thereby let a new rush of sanity and health into our society.</p>
<p>She presents us with the paradox that after spending spectacular millions and employing the most sophisticated medical science to help children come into the world, our society turns its back on them in the very years during which they are developing. She shows us how, while paying constant lip service to family, we fail to acknowledge the difficulties of parenting in the nineties and to make sure that conditions essential to the raising of children are available to parents.</p>
<p>It is Penelope Leach's contention that what parents do for their children — what they are able to do — depends on what society actually wants, approves and encourages. And, in a powerful argument against complacency, she presents specific steps by which we, as members of society, can move to fashion a new economic priority for all children; to make the child central in the fight against poverty and inequity; to achieve a rational standard of human rights for our children; and to find, in our own lives, effective new approaches to positive parenting.</p>
<p>Provocative, passionate, courageous, Children First is agroundbreaking book. It has the extraordinary potential to affect the lives not only of our own children but also of the children that they themselves will have in years to come.</p>


                        <p>The world-renowned author of the international bestseller Your Baby &amp; Child offers an urgent argument for the creation of economic and social supports which are now tragically missing for children in our society.

Only when they are already on the river do the participants realize how difficult and dangerous their time together will be. All of them must deal with ``insect stress'' caused by bees that feast on human sweat, foot fungus, raging rapids, and perhaps an evil river spirit. On top of that, Johnston begins to have menopausal hot flashes and questions whether it is time to give up the thrill of risky journeys. Her descriptions of both natural phenomena and local customs are lyrical: she compares salespeople in an outdoor market to ``baby birds, mouths open, arms aflutter.'' In writing about the seemingly cursed journey, Johnston keeps her chin up and sticks to what she calls ``the adventure code of travel: go with the unexpected and make do with what you get.''

A woman of enormous courage, both in life-threatening situations and her challenging of women's traditional roles, Tina Modotti's life became the stuff of myth and legend. Based on years of painstaking research in Mexico, Europe and the United States, Tina Modotti - Photographer and Revolutionary includes a wealth of new material and is a major step toward demythologizing the life of one of the most fascinating women of an extraordinary era. In 1913 Tina Modotti left her native Italy for San Francisco, becoming a star of the local Italian theatre before marrying the romantic poet-painter Roubaix de l'Abrie Richey. By 1920, she had embarked on a Hollywood film career and immersed herself in bohemian Los Angeles, beginning an intense relationship with the respected American photographer, Edward Weston. On a trip to Mexico in 1922 to bury her husband, she met the Mexican muralists and became enthralled with the burgeoning cultural renaissance there. Increasingly dissatisfied with the film world, she persuaded Weston to teach her photography and move with her to Mexico. Her Mexico City homes became renowned gathering places for artists, writers and radicals, where Diego Rivera courted Frida Kahlo and Latin American exiles plotted revolution. Turning her camera to record Mexico in its most vibrant years, her photographs achieve a striking synthesis of artistic form and social content. Her contact with Mexico's muralists, including a brief affair with Rivera, led to her involvement in radical politics. In 1929, she was framed for the murder of her Cuban lover, gunned down at her side on a Mexico City street.

Dream analysis, meditation, Jungian ``active imagination'' and ritual processes are among the tools set forth in a clear, concise map to territories of masculine selfhood.

One was the victory of the underdog team: a group of upstarts from Burleigh College, a small women's college in New England. The other was the bizarre collapse and death of the losing team's star player. Caused by a violent (and unexplained) allergic reaction, the player's death feels very wrong to CUAA investigator Reggie Lichtman. Add to this Pierce Nolan, a previously unknown coach who brought the winning team from obscurity to the championship in only one year, and Reggie finds herself developing unpleasant suspicions. With the politics of college athletics being what they are and with nothing concrete on which to base her concerns, Reggie's investigation of the circumstances behind the player's death and of the mysterious coach of the winning team must be both quiet and largely unofficial. The further Reggie digs into the past of Pierce Nolan and of the whole Burleigh team, the more disquieting information she uncovers pointing to a conspiracy far more extensive than the simple recruiting violations and ticket-scalping operations with which she usually deals.

From her scrupulous research and informed interpretations of historical events, Fraser succeeds in presenting Henry's queens as complex and intelligent women who struggled to express themselves in a world where females were subservient to and ruled by men. Catherine of Aragon, married to Henry for 20 years, displayed cleverness and bravery when she fought her husband's attempts to divorce her. Anne Boleyn, a learned woman, was innocent of the adultery she was accused of, but was beheaded because she could not produce a son. Unlettered, 21-year-old Katherine Howard, queen for just 18 months when she was beheaded in 1542 for the ``violent presumption'' she had committed adultery, met death on the block where her cousin Anne Boleyn had died six years earlier. By firmly anchoring each woman's fate in Henry's failure to be philoprogenitive--most crucially in not producing male heirs--Fraser makes a major contribution to feminist scholarship.

Working closely with modern descendants of those earlier inhabitants, Spector examined various tasks of daily life to try to reconstruct gender roles in the culture. In this endeavor, the awl of the title, uncovered in the dig, becomes important both for what it is able to tell us about gender roles and as a metaphor for what Spector believes should be the methodology of anthropologists. The history and daily life of the Wahpetons is imaginatively reconstructed by the author from the bits and pieces discovered in the earth. She writes with an energy and enthusiasm that make interesting what could be academic and dull. Despite her sensitivity to Natives, or perhaps because of it, one cannot help but wonder if she, in the same way as her predecessors, has not looked into the mirror of the past and seen only a reflection of herself. Still this fascinating account should interest both scholar and lay reader alike. Photos not seen by PW.

She feels confident in her privilege and grounded in the heart of her culture. But when she turns six, as if by some awful spell, she is sent to faraway England, to a posh all-girls' boarding school where she will stay for what seems like a desolate, lonely eternity. There, like the heroine of The Little Princess, she's left to find her own way - the only black in a school full of upper-class English girls whose rituals are as foreign to Remi as hers are to them. Through sheer inner exuberance, Remi triumphs over the dismal climate, social anomalies, and glaring affronts that are her English experience. She endures foreign holidays celebrated with strangers, and navigates the labyrinth of race, caste, and culture, taking nothing lying down, and emerges victorious - if changed forever. Yoruba Girl Dancing is the story of a girl's exile from her homeland and her metamorphosis into someone that even she at times hardly recognizes. Simi Bedford, who herself survived leaving Africa behind for England, tells of her young heroine's passage with a knowing wit that is simultaneously sharp and gracious, in a coming-of-age story with a brilliant edge.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A semiautobiographical first novel about a Nigerian girl's adjustment to life at an English boarding school, this is an affecting and mordant appraisal of British social mores of the '50s. Remi is six when she is deposited at the upper-crust Chilcott Manor School (where the uniform tunic is ``nigger brown''). There, the former darling of a close-knit and aristocratic Lagos family must endure the scrutiny and derision of her classmates, one of whom spreads the word that ``the black rubs off.'' Tracing Remi's adaptions to life among the British while she maintains the inevitable distance of the outsider, Bedford establishes a simultaneously wistful and cynical piquancy. Even when Remi seems to have fully assimilated, she is asked to dance by a young man who adds, ``Are you considered attractive in your own country?'' Bedford, a native of Nigeria who moved to Britain as a child and now lives in London, has written a wise and provocative book that might even prompt some soul-searching in the social circles she has skewered.

A novel of woman and machine, Correspondence blurs the boundaries between virtual reality and real life and examines the interconnectedness of fantasy, desire and memory. More than a novel, Correspondence is a roleplay and you are both reader and narrator, a computer programmer who is a compositor of fantasies. You take your source material from the accumulated hopes and desires of the world, but you must be careful. Sometimes the end result is unexpected. Emotionally deadened by the loss of your family in an accident, you begin turning yourself into a machine; you become an extension of the prosthetics for your compositing work. Soon there will be no future for you, and no past; no emotion and no pain. But your machine consciousness is not yet complete, and from your source material you create Rosa. As she grows and flourishes, Rosa develops a life of her own and starts to distance herself from you. Still deeply connected to the woman you have made, you are left with devastating choices. Subversive and utterly imaginative, Correspondence breaks the boundaries of conventional fiction to explore the meaning of consciousness itself.",en,,"Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches",10.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/94/9780879515294.jpg,Success,98.0,16.5
