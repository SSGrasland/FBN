Resist! Essays Against a Homophobic Culture
edited by MONA OIKAWA, DIONNE FALCONER & ANN DECTER
In this timely and incisive collection, lesbians and bisexual
women examine and challenge the ways in which homophobia,
lesbophobia and heterosexism function — individually, socially
and politically — and celebrate the ways in which we resist.
Resist! locates the meeting points of our resistance, a deep
gathering of thoughts and perceptions where we expose the
underpinnings of hatred and re-theorize from our own
perspective, from our own truths. A diverse cross-section of
Canadian and American writers make this a long overdue
addition to lesbian literature. This is a non-fiction companion
volume to the poetry and fiction collection Out Rage: Dykes & BIs
Resist Homophobia.

MEMOIR OF A RACE TRAITOR
By Mab Segrest
Against the backdrop of the rampaging Far Right movement of the 1980s, southern activist Mab
Segrest probes the complex intersections of racism, misogyny, homophobia, and capitalism. In
these new essays and narratives, which are grounded in two decades of feminist, gay/lesbian,
and anti-racist activism, she moves from reporting to personal reflection to historical analysis in
order to focus on the primacy of racism in shaping U.S. history and its constant complication by
forces of gender and sexuality.

HEAR MY TESTIMONY
María Teresa Tula, Human Rights Activist of El Salvador
Translated and edited by Lynn Stephen
The human sides of war and activism come to the fore in this woman’s riveting tale of ordinary
labor and extraordinary courage. In an intensely personal narrative, Tula describes her
childhood, marriage, political activism in CO-MADRES (Committee of Mothers and Relatives of
Political Prisoners, Assassinated, and Disappeared of El Salvador), and resulting imprisonment
and torture. Her testimony is followed by several contextual chapters that discuss recent
Salvadoran history, women’s grassroots organizing, and testimonial literature.

MEDIA-TIONS
Forays into the Culture and Gender Wars
By Elayne Rapping
Challenging the “backlash” theory head-on, Rapping uses decades of popular culture to show
how the mass media's gender representations have been increasingly complicated by feminist
interventions. Deconstructing such varied pop culture artifacts and figures as soap operas,
Madonna, and Amy Fisher, she uncovers a new paradigm of feminism’s future. Infused with a
refreshing, if embattled, optimism for feminist struggle, Rapping argues that the drama of
feminist struggle unfolds with uneven, but broadening influence in mass media.

This is the first time such a coalition effort has been
tried in the ten years we've been open.
After much discussion, we settled on a one day
event to “celebrate locally owned bookstores and
the communities they serve.” Each participating
store had one or more Connecticut authors read in
the store that day. We pooled money to take out a
joint ad in the two major Connecticut newspapers
and the Connecticut section of the New York Times.
(Stores grossing more than $500,00 gave $100 and
stores grossing less than $500,000 gave $50.) Each
store also donated 10% of its net sales that day to a
local literacy program. :
A few publishers donated money towards
advertising. Random House gave $500, Bantam

Has Two Mommies and How Would You Feel If Your
Dad Was Gay?
My first two moves were to write a letter to the
editor and to order copies of both books, neither of
which was available on the island. I showed them
around at every opportunity to help correct the
impression created by their opponents, one of whom
wrote in a letter to the editor: “These books are so
destructive and so radical to a young child’s devel-
oping notions of what a healthy sexual and family
relationship should be that you would have to have
no conscience at all to not be disturbed by them.”
Martha's Vineyard (year-round population
about 15,000) has been returning Gerry Studds to
Congress by landslide margins since the early
1970s. It’s no hotbed of homophobia, but
liberal/progressive political groups are few, small,
and fragmented. The Island Lesbian and Gay
Association (ILGA) is primarily a social group with
125 members, only a handful of whom ever come
out in public. No organized opposition to the chal-
lenge was expected and none materialized. What
we had was individuals writing letters and speak-
ing up at meetings. Artist unknown. Reprinted from Progressive Librarian.

Feminism is more than politics. It is a move-

these politics are themselves oppositional. Because
politics are so immediate — the personal is politi-
cal/the political is personal — it is easy to (mis)take
our particular activity for feminism. In this devel-
opmental stage of feminism, I think it is time to put
all our pieces on the kitchen table and sense the
whole of what we as feminists are about. From this
we can energize our visions and choose strategies
that serve that goal.
I suspect that what we do would begin to be
very different. I know feminists come in all ages,
but my perception is that baby boom feminists (a
lot of FBN readership and leadership), are taking
the movement along on our own mid-life crises.
Recognition, security, safety, individual indepen-
dence and autonomy as themes are playing louder
than inventiveness, risk, outrage, and rebellion.

quently, its specific meaning becomes more cloudy.
Often confusingly clumped along with “transves-
tite” and “transsexual,” “transgenderist” originally
referred to someone who lived the life of the oppo-
site sex, While remaining anatomically in their orig-
inal gender. “Transvestite” is generally used to
refer to cross-dressers, and “transsexual” to people
who have undergone some type of medical proce-
dure (from hormone injections to surgery) in order
to anatomically change to a different gender. Now,
in its loosest form, “transgender” can refer to any-
one who plays with their gender or bends gender
roles, much as the word “queer” has been claimed
by a spectrum to people who don’t fall within tradi-
tional heterosexual or homosexual boundaries.
As with many sexually-related terms, these
words mean different things to different people — Suzo Hickey

to say there'd be a slight change in format; they'd
decided the show would be a lot more fun if,
instead of answering questions about my book, I
answered questions about my own sex life.
“More fun for whom?” I asked. They ran some
sample questions by me (“What do you do to turn
your man on” What do you fantasize about?” “How
often do you fake orgasm?”). I thought about it for
about a second, then bailed out of doing the show.

humor book editor who wasn’t in the least bit
squeamish about revealing all sorts of fascinating
stuff about her sex life on television; she even faked
an orgasm. (Which was then critiqued by various
women in the audience.) It was a really funny
show, and I was thrilled not to have been part of it.

Give Me Your Good Ear is Francie’s story. A story about a daughter who
chooses to speak the truth, and in doing so chooses herself. Maureen Brady’s
essential prose is as vital and relevant today as it was 15 years ago when her
words were first published. Give Me Your Good Ear is a book of enduring value, |.
about violence and silences echoed through generations, about coming to
consciousness and learning to heal. With a new introduction by the author.
Second book in the Spinsters Ink Coming of :A g e 0 se-rie9s.33216-00-9 $9.95
The Lessons is by Melanie McAllester, a police officer with ten years
experience. She brings authentic police procedural detail to this riveting, fast-
paced suspense novel that is as much about the devastating effects of ignorance
and homophobia as it is about seeing justice served.
A special police investigative team is assembled to apprehend a serial rapist
whose victims are all lesbians. The team is led by lesbian homicide detective
Elizabeth “Tenacity” Mendoza, who never closes a case without an arrest and
. who never gives up, even when she is at risk of becoming the next victim.
Tension is heightened to an almost unbearable pitch as while stalking the stalker,
the detectives learn lessons they will never forget.

Once upon a time Amazons lived on the Black Sea coast...
Amazon Story Bones is a sumptuous and gratifying feast of story and song,
of image and lyric, of history and invention. Author Ellen Frye (The Other
Sappho, Firebrand, 1989) begins with the premise: What if the Amazons told
their own stories? The result is a collection of familiar Greek myths retold from
an Amazon perspective. Ellen Frye starts from the bones of a myth and
reconstructs history—women telling tales around a fire, weaving adventures on
their looms, easing the life passage of each other. 1-883523-00-1(pbk) $10.95
