Now, in Examining Myself, Musa Mayer offers a beautifully crafted memoir written for the nearly two hundred thousand American women stricken with breast cancer each year, as well as for their partners, families and friends. In a compelling narrative that resists sensationalism and easy answers, Mayer chronicles her experience with cancer over the past several years - from biopsy and diagnosis through mastectomy, chemotherapy and reconstructive surgery. Fears of recurrence and death, challenges to femininity, the imposing medical establishment with its often conflicting treatment options, the bewildering array of alternative methods and theories, the search for emotional support and the fear of losing new-found friends to the disease - these are the issues each breast cancer patient faces in her own way. In Examining Myself Musa Mayer shares a very personal odyssey that offers invaluable information and support about a disease that touches us all.",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",10.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/50/9780571198450.jpg,Success,100.0,17.2

Kling,Smithsonian,356.0,1994-03-17,,Hardcover,"Defying Social And Family Expectations, The Wealthy, Often Eccentric Alice Pike Barney (1857-1931) Zestfully Committed Herself To The Arts And Became Known For Her Lively Art Salons, Bohemian Lifestyle, And Unusual Family. Alice And Her Counterparts In Other Cities Represented A New Social Type: Women Who Lived Proper Upper-class Lives But Did Not Follow The Rules Using Their Wealth And Privilege To Buy Themselves Freedoms And To Promote Causes The Rich Did Not Customarily Embrace. As An Artist, Writer, Theater Director, Philanthropist, Civic Leader, And Patron Of The Arts, Alice Moved In The Turn-of-the-century Artistic Circles Of Paris, London, And Washington, D.c. Throughout Alice's Life, Which Often Seemed A Dramatic Play Of Her Own Writing, She Encountered A Brilliant Cast Of Characters: Among Them Oscar Wilde, James Mcneill Whistler, And The Legendary Explorer Henry Morton Stanley, Whose Impassioned Offer Of Marriage She Rejected. Her Easygoing Personality And Charming Wit Dazzled The Artistic Circles She Traversed With Such Ease, Winning The Friendship Of Anna Pavlova, Sarah Bernhardt, Ruth St. Denis, And Emma Calve, Among Many Others. Shortly After She Turned Nineteen, Alice Accepted The Marriage Proposal Of Gilded Age-industrialist, Albert Clifford Barney. Throughout Their Married Life, Albert Encouraged Alice To Work At Her Social Position Rather Than Her Artistic Pursuits. Her Stubborn Refusal To Compromise Her Ideals Infuriated Him And Led To Continuous Conflict. They Led Separate Lives For Much Of Their Marriage, Albert Eventually Drinking Himself Into An Early Grave, While Alice Raised Their Two Daughters, Natalie And Laura, And Established Her Salon In Europe And The United States. Alice Began Seriously Painting During The Barneys' First Trip To Paris In 1883, Studying With Charles Emile Auguste Carolus-duran, A Master Portrait Painter. She Continued Painting On Her Return To The United States, Winning Accolades And A Congressional Commission, That Shocked Washington Society, Who Found It Unseemly That A Woman Of Wealth And Social Standing Would Paint At All. She Pursued The Arts All Her Life, Exhibiting A Rare Versatility Between The Fine Arts And The Performing Arts. After Albert's Death, And During Her Subsequent Marriage To Christian Hemmick, A Man Thirty Years Her Junior, Alice Devoted Herself To The Arts And Converting Washington, D.c., From A Cultural Backwater To A True Capital Of The Arts. Among Her Other Accomplishments, Alice Designed And Built What Was Considered An Anomaly In Her Time, A Studio House Intended To Provide A Focus For The Arts And Artists Of Washington, D.c. The Studio House, As She Called It, Became The Base For Her Manipulation Of Washington Culture. However, Foremost In Alice's Intentions In Building Studio House, Was Her Desire To Show Others How To Live Artistically. To This Day, Studio House Exists As One Of The Few Extant Examples Of A Turn-of-the-century Artist's Studio Residence. With Illustrations Of Her Most Important Paintings As Well As Archival Black-and-white Photographs, This Biography Adds A Significant Chapter To The History Of Women In The Nineteenth And Twentieth Centuries.

Moraga crosses literary genres to ruminate on the paradox of being at once inside and outside the myriad struggles and communities—interlocking and often at odds—that spur her art and activism. Speaking from her experience as a queer Chicana activist/artist, Moraga is committed to building a broad politic of solidarity and justice for all dispossessed people.</p>

Although women's roles in society and marriage have changed drastically over the past few decades, the traditional concept of husband as breadwinner and household head has not kept up with these changes. According to Barreca, it is still common for women--even those with lucrative careers--to allow themselves to drift into emotional and financial dependence on men, a point she bolsters with examples from literature, popular songs and movies which illustrate how women have long regarded men as their ``saviors.'' There are problems for a woman who doesn't take responsibility for herself: the author speaks of her own failure to learn how to drive until age 33, depending on others to take her where she needed to go, all too often to places of their choice. Barreca doesn't denounce marriage, but she urges women to regard it as a journey instead of a destination and to look upon men as fallible humans instead of husband material. Only then, she notes, can there be true equality in marriage.

First of all, it's a motive; the power Che Guevara was trying to invoke in his much-quoted assertion&#58; ""At the risk of appearing ridiculous . . . the true revolutionary is moved by great feelings of love."" I think also of Paul Nizan&#58; ""You think you are innocent if you say, 'I love this woman and I want to act in accordance with my love,' but you are beginning the revolution. . . . You will be driven back&#58; to claim the right to a human act is to attack the forces responsible for all the misery in the world."" Neither of them, admittedly, was claiming the love of a woman for women, the love of a man for men, as revolutionary, as a human act.<P>But the motive is ""directed by desire"" in Jordan</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This latest offering by Jordan ( Naming Our Destiny ) begins with a series of poems written in 1991 and 1992 to Haruko, her female lover. What strikes one here is the absolute fragility of love, the premonitions of future loss that invade the speaker's present. ``Then how should I / subsist / without the benediction of our bodies / intertwined / or why?'' she asks. Never answered, the question will be posed again and again with slight variations as if, in the act of writing, one finds continuance. Moving on to love poems culled from four previous volumes, the reader senses Jordan's full range. Not only is heterosexual love given its due, but one poem seems to capture the transitional moment when the speaker wavers between her love for men and the newfound possibility of loving women. Jordan's writing is sensual and hard-edged at the same time, insisting that passion exists among commonplace objects. By beginning a poem with ``but,'' Jordan makes one feel as if one has entered a room mid-conversation and is immediately included and welcome. Her throbbing, relentless rhythm is so effective that readers find themselves mouthing the words. It's impossible to sit silently back.

0-451-18136-0,Midnight Baby: A Maggie MacGowen Mystery,"Hornsby, Wendy",Signet,304.0,1994-08-01,,Paperback,"A filmmaker's eye sees things other people miss. And Maggie MacGowen often spots the dark, hidden reasons people get lost, hurt - or murdered. So when she sees a fourteen-year-old hooker in the streetlights of MacArthur Park, Maggie knows that beneath the blond hair and garish make-up is a child with a secret dangerous enough to make her choose the mean streets over the ""safety"" of home. But as Maggie looks past all the trappings of a prostitute, ""Pisces"" begins to remind her of her own teenage daughter, Casey. Maggie knows she cannot let Pisces go back to the streets, so she does what little she can: She takes Pisces to a friend who doesn't ask questions and has a spare bed. But it isn't enough. By the following night Pisces is back in MacArthur Park, with her throat slashed. Her next bed is in the L.A. County Morgue. It's the kind of case Maggie MacGowen just can't leave to the cops, even if it brings her into contact with Mike Flynn, the veteran L.A. homicide detective with whom she has a sometimes warring, sometimes loving, relationship. Yet uncovering Pisces' true identity and finding out how a teenage girl ended up soliciting johns in the underbelly of Los Angeles will take Maggie down some mean streets she never wanted to travel. All she has going for her is a nanosecond of videotape of the killer's face. But the shocking reality outside the camera lens is that no one protected Pisces from the quick, brutal death that claimed her. Maggie needs all her sharp wits and keen instincts for exposing the secrets that conceal the killer: a shadowy man in a red Corvette who will kill to keep the past buried.

                        <p>Maggie MacGowen, the feisty heroine of Telling Lies, is an investigative filmmaker-turned-sleuth exposing the truth as she tracks down the killer of a 14-year-old streetwalker known only as Pisces. ""Well-plotted, deft suspense . . . plenty of action and sex.""--Publishers Weekly.

0-275-94735-1,Women in Baseball,"Berlage, Gai I",Holtzbrinck,224.0,1994-02-23,,Hardcover,"<p><P>Very few people are aware that women were active in baseball in the United States as early as 1866. In this volume, Gai Berlage reports the histories of the umpires, players, owners, and sportswriters as well as the teams.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>The reader of this book quickly realizes that the history of women in baseball has been little written about because there hasn't been much. Baseball became a sport at women's colleges almost simultaneously with the development of professional men's baseball. But 19th-century college authorities initially discouraged and then prohibited intercollegiate games, so baseball never became a major campus sport. There was also pressure on women to play softball instead of hardball. Then, between 1943 and 1954 the short-lived All American Girls Baseball League in the Chicago area played an amalgam of softball and hardball. Berlage, a sociology professor at Iona College in New York, has done prodigious research to uncover the few women who played semi-pro ball, but the results, especially given his pedestrian writing, hardly justify his efforts.

0-525-93821-4,When the Rainbow Goddess Wept,"Brainard, Cecilia Manguerra",Dutton,224.0,1994-03-15,,Hardcover,"<p>Set against the backdrop of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, Cecilia Manguerra Brainard's brilliant novel weaves myth and legend together with the suffering and tragedies of the Filipino people. When nine-year-old Yvonne flees with her family into the jungle to join the resistance effort, she witnesses death and destruction on an almost unimaginable scale.</p>
<p>In the face of terror and despair, she finds comfort in the stories her people have passed down over generations. In particular, the legends of Bongkatolan, the Woman Warrior, and the merciful rainbow goddess offer her strength and hope. Yvonne becomes determined to preserve these ancient legends and to give voice to the epic she herself is living.</p>
<p><i>When the Rainbow Goddess Wept</i> is an exploration of the collective wounding of the Filipino people and their heroic response. It shows us the Philippines through an insider's eyes and brings to American audiences an unusual reading experience about a world that is utterly foreign and a child who is touchingly universal.</p>
<p>Cecilia Manguerra Brainard was born in Cebu City, Philippines. Her published works include <i>Woman with Horns and Other Stories</i> and <i>Philippine Woman in America</i>. She is also the editor of the anthology <i>Fiction by Filipinos in America</i> and teaches creative writing at the Writers' Program of UCLA Extension.</p>


                        <p>Brainard's fresh and powerful voice fills a void in Asian-American literature with a novel steeped in the enchantment and suffering of the Filipino people. In the story of nine-year-old Yvonne's flight from the Japanese invasion and her determination to hold fast to her people's myths and legends, Brainard lays bare the real-life drama of World War II's devastating effect on the lives of the Filipinos.

The human side of the civil war in El Salvador and decades of repression come to the fore in this woman's tale of extraordinary courage and ordinary labor.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>While military solutions to social problems take an awful toll in human suffering, the military's gain in wealth and power is apt to make it reluctant to support peace unless funds are cut off. Tiny, overpopulated El Salvador has recently emerged from a savage 13-year civil war that devastated the country. The war, in reality an agrarian movement to rectify the ownership of over half the land by two percent of the people, gave rise to such human rights abuses that thousands were massacred or fled abroad. Protests by women in turn made them aware of their own status as a disadvantaged group. The author herself was transformed from a peasant to an international human rights activist. Those who know Latin America will not be surprised at her story; a similar story is Nidia Diaz's I Was Never Alone: A Prison Diary from El Salvador (Ocean, 1992).

<p>As a prizewinning foreign correspondent for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Geraldine Brooks spent six years covering the Middle East through wars, insurrections, and the volcanic upheaval of resurgent fundamentalism. Yet for her, headline events were only the backdrop to a less obvious but more enduring drama: the daily life of Muslim women. <b>Nine Parts of Desire</b> is the story of Brooks' intrepid journey toward an understanding of the women behind the veils, and of the often contradictory political, religious, and cultural forces that shape their lives. Defying our stereotypes about the Muslim world, Brooks' acute analysis of the world's fastest growing religion deftly illustrates how Islam's holiest texts have been misused to justify repression of women, and how male pride and power have warped the original message of a once liberating faith.</p>

Will I teach my daughter the right things? How do I correct the mistakes my mother made with me?
<p>Mother Daughter Revolution: From Betrayal to Power addresses all the issues that a mother guiding a budding woman could possibly need to know about. Authors Elizabeth Debold, Marie Wilson, and Idelisse Malave approach these dilemmas as would any other mother who is concerned with the survival of her daughter in a male-dominant society would. This book centers on women's attempts to build trusting relationships with their daughters. The foundation of this trust is based on removing the feeling of betrayal that develops when daughters feel that their mothers have not prepared them for the earthshaking changes they experience during adolescence. Lack of preparation for these changes leads to a lack of confidence and an inability to deal with competition.</p>
<p>Mother Daughter Revolution is written in a problem and solution style and describes the path from adolescence to womanhood through identifiable stories and anecdotes. Many mothers recount stories of being told by their mothers to ""be nice"" because ""nice girls get married and get good things."" Well, these new mothers opt to tell their daughters that being nice is not always an option, especially if ""being nice"" infringes upon their rights.</p>


                        <p>Essential reading for women of all ages, this compassionate and impassioned book looks at the astonishing phenomenon wherein young girls, initially so much more individual and self-assured than their male peers, find themselves subtly silenced--boxed in by the social standard of ""good girl"" behavior.

<p>The most popular citizen of Virginia has been dead for nearly 170 years. That hasn't stopped the good people of tiny Crozet, Virginia, from taking pride in every aspect of Thomas Jefferson's life. But when an archaeological dig of the slave quarters at Jefferson's home, Monticello, uncovers a shocking secret, emotions in Crozet run high—dangerously high.</p>
<p>The stunning discovery at Monticello hints a hidden passions and age-old scandals. As postmistress Mary Minor ""Harry"" Haristeen and some of Crozet's Very Best People try to learn the identity of a centuries-old skeleton—and the reason behind the murder—Harry's tiger cat, Mrs. Murphy, and her canine and feline friends attempt to sniff out a modern-day killer. Mrs. Murphy and corgi Tee Tucker will stick their paws into the darker mysteries of human nature to solve murders old and new—before curiosity can kill the cat—and Harry Haristeen.</p>


                        <p>Virginia postmistress Mary Minor Haristeen and Mrs. Murphy, her tiger-striped Sherlock, return for their third wise and witty adventure. Tracking down the identity of a 200-year-old corpse unearthed at Thomas Jefferson's home, and learning why someone today would kill to keep the identity hidden, keeps humans and animals alike on their toes.

A delicious puzzle.&quot; The Boston Globe The murder is in America, but the call goes out to Scotland Yard superintendent Richard Jury. Accompanied by his aristocratic friend Melrose Plant and by Sergeant Wiggins, Jury arrives in Baltimore, Maryland, home of zealous Orioles fans, mouth-watering crabs, and Edgar Allan Poe. In his efforts to solve the case, Jury rubs elbows with a delicious and suspicious cast of characters, embarking on a trail that leads to a unique tavern called &quot;The Horse You Came In On&quot; . . .</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In her latest Richard Jury novel (after The Old Contemptibles ), Grimes sends her Scotland Yard superintendent to the States to investigate a murder but assigns most of the sleuthing to his pal Melrose Plant. Jury and Inspector Wiggins take a busman's holiday in Baltimore to look into the murder of a young American, the nephew of a friend of Jury's acquaintance Lady Cray, at a cabin in Pennsylvania. Plant has come along to visit his friend Ellen Taylor, a novelist whose student at Johns Hopkins was recently murdered near the grave of Edgar Allan Poe. The intricate plot also involves the murder of a homeless man in a Baltimore alley and unfolds in oblique, unexpected turns, hinging on the partial manuscript, found by the dead student, of what might be a lost Poe short story and on the ambitions of descendants of an old Baltimore family. Jury and Wiggins talk to local police and shopkeepers; Plant tours Baltimore with Hughie the cabbie, picking up clues; and Ellen writes (while chained to her chair) the sequel to her first novel while agonizing over its near plagiarism by another writer. Notable for its themes of authorship and authenticity and for the cast of delightfully eccentric characters--who gather each day at a blue-collar bar called The Horse You Came In On--this mystery, with its feathery plot and fey, lighthearted tone, moves in quite a different direction than earlier Jury tales.

Esi, a woman living in Accra, Ghana, takes her career as a data analyst for the government seriously. An incident of marital rape, the result of her husband's anger at Esi's independence, leads to their separation. She is attracted to a married man named Ali who offers to make her his second wife. At first the arrangement appeals to Esi--she can make her work a priority--but eventually Ali's constant traveling and the way he puts off coming to see her begins to bother her. Aidoo makes use of different formats. Occasionally she provides an explanation in the form of a poetic note embedded in the text, and there are spurts of conversation in script form. In one such section Esi's mother and grandmother discuss her choice. Esi's no-nonsense grandmother says, ``Leave one man, marry another. What is the difference?''

Petite, attractive, hip, cholesterol-conscious, and gay, Lauren isn't your typical private detective. She shares a brownstone apartment with her psychologist lover, Kip, in New York's fashionable Greenwich Village, where they are surrounded by a circle of warm friends who keep them well insulated from the craziness of city life. But when Lauren's closest childhood friend, Megan Harbaugh, is murdered in her West Village jewelry store, the illusion of protection is instantly shattered. Lauren is hired by one of Megan's former husbands to investigate the crime, which propels her on several searches at once. The first is personal. Not only must Lauren come to grips with her best friend's death, but she finds herself questioning just how well she really knew Megan, who, though straight herself, was the first person to accept Lauren's lesbianism. While the list of suspects grows and the danger mounts, Lauren also begins wondering how well she knows anyone as she uncovers one startling surprise after another about her friends - and herself.

In her eloquent prose, Yamauchi, a Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) illuminates the neglected social and emotional history of two generations of Japanese in the United States, recalling the harsh lives of rural immigrants, tenant farmers, and itinerant laborers. Informed by her own family history, her stories and plays recreate the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans and their postwar return to urban centers. She captures their ambivalent longings for the prewar family and culture of Japan. She also writes more recently of very young Mexican immigrants hired in as cheap labor in southern California who view a middle-aged Japanese woman as ""the American"", and ask her for advice. The irony is almost too daunting for her to bear, as she thinks about the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without bitterness, and often with quiet humor, Yamauchi's human-sized dramas open into larger social histories and the great narrative myths of culture.
