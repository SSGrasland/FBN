Lesbians in Long-Term Recovery
OUT FROM UNDER, Volume Two

Ten years after the publication of her widely loved and groundbreaking
book about lesbians and recovery, Jean Swallow takes a new look at long-
term recovery in lesbian communities. Here are heartbreaking stories, fine
writing, and raw courage. “If you want to know where we've been for the
last ten years,” writes Swallow, “take a look: we went away and came back
whole. These are our stories.”

THE PERSISTENT DESIRE
A femme-butch reader
edited by Joan Nestle
A generation ago, butch-femme identities were taken for granted in the
lesbian community. Today women who think of themselves as butch or
femme often face prejudice from both the lesbian community and the
straight world. Here, for the first time, dozens of femme and butch lesbians
tell their stories of love, survival, and triumph.

court. There has never been a case like this in
Canadian — or any other — courts.
Little Sisters isn’t “just” protesting the prohibi-
tion of certain specific titles that ought not be

Columbia Supreme Court throw Canada Customs
out of the censorship business.
The goal of the case is to nail the current system
on two grounds: 1) that Canada Customs’ power of
prior restraint (to detain material prior to its being
legally determined to be obscene by the courts)
infringes on section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms and, 2) that Canada Customs
has been unfairly discriminatory to writers, readers
and distributors of gay and lesbian erotica, contrary
to section 15 of the Charter — the right to equality
under the law. Little Sisters’ challenge also declares
that neither of these infringements are justified The Case to Date

A new translation
by celebrated
novelist
John Fowles
OHN FOWLES presents a remarkable translation
of a nineteenth-century work that inspired his
acclaimed novel The French Lieutenant's Woman
and will astonish and haunt modern readers.
Based on a true story, Ourika relates the experiences of a
Senegalese girl who is rescued from slavery and raised by an
aristocratic French family during the French Revolution.
Brought up in a household of learning and privilege, she is
unaware of her difference until she overhears a conversation
that makes her suddenly conscious of her race—and of the
prejudice it arouses. From this point on, Ourika lives her life
primarily not as a French woman but as a black woman “cut
off from the entire human race.” As the Reign of Terror
threatens her and her adoptive family, Ourika struggles with
her unusual position as an educated African woman in
eighteenth-century Europe.
A best-seller in the 1820s, Ourika captured the attention
of Duras’s peers, including Stendhal, and became the sub-
ject of four contemporary plays. The work represents a
number of firsts: the first novel set in Europe to have a black
OURIKA: Aan English Translation heroine, the first French literary work narrated by a black
Claire de Duras female protagonist, and, as Fowles points out in the fore-
word to his translation, “the first serious attempt by a white

intelligent, brave and true. Next time you hear somebody
talking nonsense about sex radicals, refer them to this
book... Public Sex is the real thing without the tedious
bullshit and self-serving obscurity that characterizes so
much writing about sex.” — DOROTHY ALLISON
For 15 years, Pat Califia has been “fussing and fuming
about sexual repression and censorship.” Public Sex
collectsCalifia’s best essays on porn, lesbian S/M,
unmonogamy, the modern leather community

A young boy looking in the reflecting waters of
a lake with his friends suddenly realizes that he is
different from them. Through the pages of Less
Than Half, More Than Whole by Kathleen and
Michael Lacapa, illustrated by Michael Lacapa,
Tony searches for a way to understand what it
means to be “less than half” of a particular heritage.
Finally, while visiting his grandfather and examin-
ing the creator's gift of corn, he is shown that he is
“more than whole.” Although it would be nice if a
female character had been included in Tony’s group
of friends, the gorgeous graphic illustrations in this
book as well as its effective handling of what it
means to come from a multicultural background
make it well worth adding to your children’s sec-
tion ($14.95 cl, 0-87358-592-5).

Curious Wine
by Katherine V. Forrest
Read by Jane Merrow
Produced by J. Urling-Clarke
Adapted for recording by Prelude Audio Books
Considered the most popular lesbian novel of all time,
Curious Wine, by Katherine V. Forrest, has now been
released by Naiad Press in audio book form on two 100-
minute cassettes.
The group of women who meet for a ski weekend will
all be touched by what happens in the intimate log
cabin at Lake Tahoe, For beautiful Lane Christianson
and hurt, vulnerable Diana Holland, the events are to
prove cataclysmic. Breathtakingly candid in its
romantic eroticism — a love story to cherish.
Reader Jane Merrow moved to Los Angeles in 1971.
Her film credits include a Golden Globe nomination
for her role in The Lion in Winter. She has appeared
in many movies and dozens of TV series including
Hart to Hart and The Incredible Hulk. In recent years she has
worked in film development. A project of hers that will be widely known in
women’s circles in Against the Tide, the story of Dame Naomi James’ single-handed sailing
voyage around the world.
Available now for only $16.95! ISBN: 1-56280-105-8
