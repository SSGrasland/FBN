satisfactory explanation for why Madonna’s Sex

Canadian Customs’ regulations, eroticizes violence
against women in exactly the way banned by the
Butler decision, was passed through Customs on

took the time to give us her top five picks for books
about menopause:
e The basic premise of Dr. Susan M. Lark’s
Menopause Self-Help Book: A Woman’s Guide to
Feeling Wonderful for the Second Half of Her Life
is that nearly all of the symptoms of menopause can
be prevented or relieved using a variety of dietary
and other natural techniques. With an empathetic
and direct approach, Lark tells how to manage
menopause and turn it into a significant — not a
painful — transition into a wonderful new phase of
a woman's life. In Theresa's experience, this is the
book most often recommeded to customers by their
physicians. $16.95 pb, 0-89087-529-8, Celestial Arts,

Theresa Corrigan at Lioness Books recommends
' the following four titles on breast cancer, plus one
sidelines item:
° Dr. Susan Love’s Breast Book by Susan Love
and Karen Lindsay. Susan Love is a leading femi-
nist physician “expert” on breast cancer, and has
had breast cancer herself. The book is honest and
direct; but more than that, it tends to dispel panic
by recognizing that breast cancer is a slow-moving
disease and that women should take the time to
make good decisions. Love does not always recom-
mend the most radical treatment, and puts this
aspect of medical intervention in perspective. Two

dedicated, gifted physician-teacher who will act as her preceptor.
Into this situation comes only one problem: Diana and Torrie fall deeply in love.
Torrie has one other difficulty, so enormous that it will become the overriding challenge

Yu REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND WRONGS
End The Global Politics of Population Control
Press O ASSAaElaiEi
As population control again becomes a national and international obsession, this
completely revised second edition of the feminist classic repudiates, with clear
analysis and thorough documentation, the attempts of population policymakers to
appropriate the language of progressive feminist and environmental movements.
“If I had time to read just one book to gain an understanding of the popula-
tion and development link, this one would be it.” '
—Dianne J. Forte, National Black Women’s Health Project `:
“Stands out amid the rising tide of books on the population question. Hartmann’s
critique of global special interests in population and the environment are must
reading for students and policy analysts.”
—Judy Norsigian & Norma Swenson, co-authors, The New Our Bodies, Ourselves
“At this juncture in history when victim blaming has become more blatant and op-
pressive, there is a need for voices of sanity. This book is such a voice. It reflects
conviction, courage, sensitivity, and deep insight.” Beny Hatsan

BEYOND THE DOUBLE BIND
Women and Leadership
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON
Drawing on interviews with hundreds of working women, Kathleen Hall Jamieson
provides a groundbreaking account of how women can overcome the social binds
that block their success. She astutely analyzes many of the catch-22s that
society uses to block women’s advance, shows how other women have
successfully dealt with these obstacles, and sharply criticizes the victim
feminism of Susan Faludi and others. With extensive research and incisive
analysis, Jamieson provides a truly landmark account of the traps that
ensnare women's lives, and the ways they can escape them. $25.00, 272 pp.
