1-56023-040-1,Women and Sexual Harassment: A Practical Guide to the Legal Protections of Title VII and the Hostile Environment Claim,"Berring, Robert C, Chan, Anja A",Routledge,124.0,1994-09-30,,Paperback,"<p>Here is a valuable guide that saves researchers investigating sexual harassment in the workplace enormous amounts of time and money. Focusing on the hostile environment claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Women and Sexual Harassment is a complete resource tool. In one easy-to-use volume, it provides a detailed background and history of the hostile environment claim as well as an extensive guide on how to use and where to find the best resources available on this topic. Unlike some legal books, Chan’s book does not require cover-to-cover reading to access pertinent information.</p>
<p>Anyone, whether they are interested in the specifics of the hostile environment claim or sexual harassment in general, will be able to locate the information they’re looking for with the help of this handy guide. It saves enormous amounts of time, effort, and money for researchers by providing extensive listings and evaluations of statutes, cases, agency decisions, law review articles, annotations, and books containing information on this subject. Readers can use the book to get a better understanding of the hostile environment claim or use it like a dictionary to pinpoint the specific resources that will be most useful to their area of research.</p>
<p>Women and Sexual Harassment is logically divided into five complete parts to make it easy to use: Part 1: Clearly explains how to best use the book to access specific information. Part 2: Describes the history and present state of the hostile environment claim in a manner that is to the point, yet is more thorough than descriptions of the claim found in articles, cases, or other sources. Part 3: Research guide—Directs researchers to the best sources for information, categorized by type and area. Includes tips that will save hours in the library and will help researchers find the most up-to-the-minute articles and cases. Part 4: Bibliography of primary legal sources—Covers statutes, regulations, and case law on the hostile environment claim and sexual harassment. Part 5: Bibliography of secondary sources—Includes books, articles, surveys, and legislative history.</p>
<p>The annotated bibliography, broken down by type of source and type of information, not only points researchers in the right direction but also steers them away from sources that seem valuable from their title, but are in fact not worthwhile. The insightful written analysis of the hostile environment claim alone provides researchers unfamiliar with the subject with a clearly written history and definition of the claim, its key elements, employer liability, statute of limitations, remedies, considerations of discovery and evidence, and related claims.</p>
<p>Women and Sexual Harassment is an invaluable guide for all types of researchers including victims of sexual harassment considering filing a hostile environment claim, scholars interested in women’s issues, attorneys unfamiliar with this area, employers interested in limiting their liability by taking steps to prevent sexual harassment in their workplaces, and law students in any level of courses related to sex discrimination or sexual harassment.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.38 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds, Width: 0.28 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/03/9781560230403.jpg,Success,101,17.5

0-89096-617-6,Mountaineering Women: Stories by Early Climbers,,Texas A&M University Press,200.0,1994-10-01,,Paperback,"Women have known the challenges and triumphs of mountaineering for nearly two centuries, and for nearly as long they have been writing about their accomplishments, creating a fascinating, often thrilling literature of adventure and daring. As with other aspects of women's history, however, the literature of mountaineering women has been scattered and largely forgotten. Sixteen of their stories - sometimes published under the name of a male relative, sometimes under anonymous bylines such as ""a Lady"" - are here recovered and collected for the first time. The women who speak to us in this book climbed on the world's highest peaks and most difficult rock faces, from the English Lake District to the Alps to the Andes and Himalaya. Some were politically motivated, like the American Annie Smith Peck, who considered her spectacular ascents a strategy for advancing the liberation of her sex. Others were staunchly conservative about all matters save their personal right to climb mountains, a right that could rarely be taken for granted and sometimes proved as difficult to win as the summit itself. These stories are as much about people as about mountains. They tell of conflict and cooperation, of women struggling not only to reach a summit but also to negotiate their freedom in a society that preferred they simply stay at home. The editor's introduction provides an overview of the two hundred-year history of women's climbing and places it in the context of that struggle. Mountaineering Women shows how highly skilled, courageous, and determined women have revised and transformed a traditionally masculine activity, while at the same time transforming themselves - each arriving, as Mary Crawford put it, ""at last upon the summit to gaze out upon a new world. Surely not the same old earth she has seen all her life? Yes - but looked at from on top - a point of view which now makes upon her mind its indelible impression.""",en,1st Ed.,"Height: 8.48 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/74/9780890966174.jpg,Success,38,17.5

Larque's loved ones accept her uncanny, unconscious, often embarrassing habit of producing temporary doubles - ""doppelgangers"" - of people and their inner aspects from out of thin air. But now her latest creation, herself at age ten, refuses to fade away quietly - leaving Larque no choice but to bear the taunts and accusations of the scabby-kneed golliwog girl she once was. For the child, Sky, will not accept the compromises Larque has made in her life - and, ultimately, leads her older self out into the vast, adult and mysterious night in search of lost dreams. Larque's nocturnal wanderings take her farther from home and hearth than she ever imagined possible - to the neon pinks and Day-Glo yellows of Popular Street, where life is exciting and gay. Here in this secret place, she meets the beautiful, tormented cowboy Shadow - and Argent, the handsome stud-lover Shadow has molded from the pliable clay of middle-aged angst. And it is here, beneath Shadow's talented fingers, that Larque herself is remade - becoming a new ""Lark,"" younger, stronger, more courageous...and male. But freedom is a pricey commodity - and there are those who would gladly clip Larque's newly formed wings. Her loving, gentle, bearlike husband Hoot desperately wants her back - steadfastly refusing to accept his wife as a muscular, teenaged boy. And her disapproving mother is especially dangerous - since she has the power to ""blink"" her errant daughter into some maternally approved, no-warts ideal. But the most fearsome adversary of all lurks deep within an already splintered Larque/Lark - a doppelganger in sensible shoes who, if released, could swallow up the Harootunian family whole and leave Popular Street in ruins: the dreaded Virtuous Woman.

Only when they are already on the river do the participants realize how difficult and dangerous their time together will be. All of them must deal with ``insect stress'' caused by bees that feast on human sweat, foot fungus, raging rapids, and perhaps an evil river spirit. On top of that, Johnston begins to have menopausal hot flashes and questions whether it is time to give up the thrill of risky journeys. Her descriptions of both natural phenomena and local customs are lyrical: she compares salespeople in an outdoor market to ``baby birds, mouths open, arms aflutter.'' In writing about the seemingly cursed journey, Johnston keeps her chin up and sticks to what she calls ``the adventure code of travel: go with the unexpected and make do with what you get.''

1-55972-230-4,My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold,"Barr, Geraldine, Schwarz, Ted",Birch Lane Pr,293.0,1994,,Hardcover,"Geraldine Barr knows her sister Roseanne Barr Arnold like no other person. She grew up with her, dreamed and schemed with her - from the trailer parks of rural Colorado to the pinnacle of television stardom. Roseanne's success was neither spontaneous nor unplanned. Flying in the face of Hollywood's sexist stereotypes, Roseanne and Geraldine created the brilliant persona of Roseanne the ""Domestic Goddess"" who showed that a working-class woman could be as funny, smart, and insightful as any man. My Sister Roseanne is a bittersweet memoir of growing up Jewish in Mormon Utah, of discovering feminism, lesbianism, and the power of community in a small Denver bookstore; it is a tale of hilarious collaboration on the development of the ""Domestic Goddess"" character, of learning how to deliver a feminist message with jokes that made women laugh and men think. It is an insider's story of the comedy club explosion of the 198Os, an exploration of the surreal dining rituals of Hollywood agents and of the miraculous adventure of two determined women taking Hollywood by storm. My Sister Roseanne is also a story of paranoia and betrayal, of Roseanne's abandonment of the sisters' shared dream for the dubious role of ""Mrs. Arnold,"" a plastic-surgery-enhanced habitue of the talk show circuit who discovered that she could say anything - and the media, from the tabloids to the talk shows to Vanity Fair, would treat it as gospel truth. A compelling and at times frightening story, My Sister Roseanne reveals what happens when collaboration gives way to blind ambition and the power to invent and reinvent yourself becomes as dangerous and destabilizing as any drug.

                        <p>My Life as a Woman, Roseanne Barr Arnold's 1989 bestseller, was largely written by her sister Geraldine. Now Geraldine offers her own pointed, bittersweet memoir of what it's like to be the kid sister, confidante, and now estranged business partner of the No. 1 entertainer of the 1990s. Photos.

Susan McCabe argues that Bishop counters modernist claims for an autonomous art object and an impersonal artist; Bishop's writing never represents an escape into perfected forms, but instead calls attention to the processes of language that construct identity. McCabe emphasizes how personal experience is deeply enmeshed with Bishop's poetics. Bishop's project returns to her early losses—the death of her father and her mother's madness—and uses them to disclose the instability of the concepts of self or place through a rhetoric of indeterminacy and uncertainty. Although Bishop has recently begun to receive the critical attention she deserves, this book uniquely brings loss to the foreground in connection with identity, gender, and the fashioning of a feminist poetics.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.08908357428 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches",30.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/89/9780271010489.jpg,Success,109,17.5

In 1830 traces of both men suddenly and completely disappeared from Mary Shelley's life, but not from historical evidence. Betty T.

1-55713-158-9,From Cuba With a Song (Sun & Moon Classics),"Sarduy, Severo",Sun & Moon Press,104.0,2000-04-01,,Paperback,"Born in eastern Cuba, Sarduy studied at the University of Havana, and, with Guillermo Cabrera Infante, was one of the few writers involved in the fight against Batista. At an early age he was made publisher of the Lunes de Revolucion, the official organ of the 26th of July Movement. In 1960 he left for Paris. In Paris Sarduy became the editor of the Latin American collection of Editions du Seuil, and became involved with the Tel Quel group. Among the books he introduced to the French were Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude and Lezama Lima's Paradiso. Sarduy himself, meanwhile, published several works including Escrito sobre un cuerpo (Written on a Body), Maitreya, Colibri, La simulacion, Overdose, and Daiquiri, a book of poems that uses Baroque prosody to describe gay sex in explicit terms. De Donde son los cantantes (From Cuba with a Song) was Sarduy's first truly experimental work. Divided into three sections, each corresponding to the ethnic groups that make up Cuban nationality (Spanish, African, and Chinese), the book explores the disparate elements at work in Latin American culture. Culture, for Sarduy, is a series of radical and often violent displacements and errors. Transvestitism becomes the common denominator as a symbol of transformation (physical and spiritual) and delusion. As Gonzalez Echevarria observes, ""In De Donde son los cantantes, the characters look as if they're made up for a carnival that will let loose their deepest and weirdest fantasies. Sarduy's novel exposes the complicity between the novel's conventions and society's patriarchal structure. He denounces the quest for Latin American identity as yet another ideological maneuver by essentially epic novelists who want to strengthen the hold of the mechanisms of authority.""",en,First Edition,"Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",10.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/84/9781557131584.jpg,Success,84,17.5

We must all negotiate the voice of our culture and its contradictory messages about food and the body. These cultural imperatives especially confuse and burden women as they struggle with the insidious power of the diet culture and current demands about body size and shape. In this insightful analysis of an treatment guide for eating problems, the authors develop a clinically useful theory of how society’s injunctions about the “right” body and the “right” diet become inscribed in patients and join with their intrapsychic emotional life. By merging their theory of the internalization of culture (and feminist critique of that culture) with an object relations and interpersonal psychoanalytic theory, the authors deliver for all therapists a powerful therapeutic model, one honed by twenty years of practice at the Women’s Therapy Centre Institute.Many treatments for eating problems make controlling the symptom their goal; this book demonstrates that this approach merely reproduces in the patient the loss of agency created by internalized messages from a fat-phobic society. Only by understanding the symptom as an expression of the confluence of intrapsychic, interpersonal, and cultural experience can the therapist help the patient learn to live in peace in her body. The authors present a psychodynamic understanding of hunger, satiation, food, and body image, and show how everyday body/self and eating experiences contain and reveal the essential dynamics of the person. They also describe how these dynamics, as well as the influences of consumer culture, affect transference and countertransference in treatment.A thoughtful discussion of the convergence of eating problems and sexual abuse extends the existing theory about how consumer culture injures women and aggravates the wounds of abuse. It also details the tremendous value of this feminist psychoanalytic treatment model for helping people with dissociative problems, including multiple personality disorder.Illustrated with rich case vignettes, this practical guide will show clinicians how to use an anti-diet, anti-deprivation model of treatment to help patients learn to feed themselves in tune with their psychic and bodily needs.

Fisher worked diligently, and against time, in the months just before her death to assemble her never-before-published journals, short stories, and correspondence, weaving them into two volumes. Continuing where she left off in To Begin Again, this book presents a candid and revealing portrait of the artist during what may have been the most traumatic period of her life. Fisher and her first husband, Al, had returned from France to California by 1933, but the Depression had reduced their hopes and frustrated their artistic aspirations. After a short stay, they left California for Switzerland, accompanied by their friend Dillwyn Parrish. This is Fisher's most open account of their complicated triangle, and in it she reveals the details behind her decision to divorce her husband and marry Parrish. A short time after their marriage, Parrish developed Buerger's disease, and Fisher chronicles their heartbreaking battle with this terrible degenerative illness. As fascism swept across Europe, they returned to California, remaining through Parrish's decline and ultimate suicide. This was an excruciating time for Fisher, who was forced to watch helplessly as the disease ravaged the man she would call ""the love of my life,"" just as the Nazis marched in to conquer her beloved France. ""When I write of hunger,"" says Fisher, ""I am really writing about love and the hunger for it... [and] the warmth and the riches and the fine reality of hunger satisfied... and it is all one."" Stay Me, Oh Comfort Me documents, with arresting candor and emotion, the loves and longing that would shape the rest of Fisher's remarkable life and forever inform her work.

Western history is thoroughly covered and supplemented by information on Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa. From Cro-Magnon childbirth and ancient Egyptian cosmetics to Janet Reno and the Tailhook scandal, the breadth, diversity, and accessibility of this work make it invaluable for identifying the accomplishments and circumstances of women in any given historical period. Entries are arranged by year or group of years in an easy-to-use format of ten subject categories. Here the reader will find information concerning women's legal rights, life expectancy, medical care, and daily tasks, as well as the achievements of thousands of individual women in politics, warfare, jurisprudence, literature, the visual and performing arts, athletics, exploration, activism, business, science, scholarship, and religion.</p><P></p><P>Women have had to overcome major obstacles throughout human history and they have accomplished much despite those barriers. This work contains many thousands of testimonies to their achievements. Brief entries summarize the most important or characteristic events of each period, while explanatory essays illuminate broad trends and unusual aspects of women's lives in a variety of cultures. Information can be located easily by consulting the topic and name index, and a bibliography is also included.</p></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Olsen (Remember the Ladies: A Woman's Book of Days, Main Street Pr., 1988) has compiled an international chronology of 5000 notable women who lived from 20,000 B.C. to 1993. Information is arranged by year or group of years and then by subject categories that include daily life, law and government, literature and the visual arts, activism, science, business, education, athletics, and the like. A great amount of information is cited, though some entries seem trivial-for example, a 1630 entry about English merchant Edith Doddington, who sold wheat, butter, and cheese in four counties. The 100-page index (not seen), which includes subjects as well as proper names, should do much to pull together related information. Modeled on his People's Chronology (LJ 3/1/92), Trager's work covers the same time frame as Olsen's, but he identifies about 3500 women as compared with Olsen's 5000. Like Olsen, Trager uses subject categories within divisions by year or years. While Olsen identifies her 11 categories by phrases, Trager employs the same 29 symbols he used in his earlier work. In general, Trager's entries are longer than Olsen's and, indeed, his work is almost twice the length. A comparison of several years yields surprisingly little overlap in information. In 1922, for example, each author listed about 40 entries, but fewer than a quarter of the events overlap. Similar entries are generally literary events. Because of its greater length, the Trager book is the preferred purchase, but given the high interest in the topic and the relatively low number of repeated items, a case could be made for acquiring both books. Another recent women's chronolgy, Judith Clark's Almanac of American Women in the 20th Century (LJ 8/87), is much narrower in focus and time period.

Such worlds are Middle Earth, Dune—and such a world is Winter.""&nbsp; Twenty-five years and a Hugo and Nebula Award later, these words remain true. In Winter, or Gethen, Ursula K. Le Guin has created a fully realized planet and people. But Gethen society is more than merely a fascinating creation. The concept of a society existing totally without sexual prejudices is even more relevant today than it was in 1969. This special 25th anniversary edition of <b>The Left Hand of Darkness</b> contains not only the complete, unaltered text of the landmark original but also a thought-provoking new afterword and four new appendixes by Ms. Le Guin.</p>
<p>When the human ambassador Genly Ai is sent to Gethen, the planet known as Winter by those outsiders who have experienced its arctic climate, he thinks that his mission will be a standard one of making peace between warring factions. Instead the ambassador finds himself wildly unprepared. For Gethen is inhabited by a society with a rich, ancient culture full of strange beauty and deadly intrigue—a society of people who are both male and female in one, and neither. This lack of fixed gender, and the resulting lack of gender-based discrimination, is the very cornerstone of Gethen life. But Genly is all too human. Unless he can overcome his ingrained prejudices about the significance of ""male"" and ""female,"" he may destroy both his mission and himself.</p>",en,Reissue,Weight: 0.35 Pounds,9.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/25/9780441478125.jpg,Success,81,17.5

0-8018-4873-3,"Illness, Gender, and Writing: The Case of Katherine Mansfield","Burgan, Professor Mary",The Johns Hopkins University Press,248.0,1994-10-01,,Hardcover,"<p>Katherine Mansfield is remembered for writing brilliant short stories that helped to initiate the modernist period in British fiction, and for the fact that her life--lived at a feverish pace on the fringes of Bloomsbury during the First World War--ended after a prolonged battle with pulmonary disease when she was only thirty-four years old. While her life was marred by emotional and physical afflictions of the most extreme kind, argues Mary Burgan in Illness, Gender, and Writing, her stories have seemed to exist in isolation from those afflictions--as stylish expressions of the ""new,"" as romantic triumphs of art over tragic circumstances, or as wavering expressions of Mansfield's early feminism.</p>
<p>In the first book to look at the continuum of a writer's life and work in terms of that writer's various illnesses, Burgan explores Katherine Mansfield's recurrent emotional and physical afflictions as the ground of her writing.</p>
<p>Mansfield is remarkably suited to this approach, Burgan contends, because her ""illnesses"" ranged from such early psychological afflictions as separation anxiety, body image disturbances, and fear of homosexuality to bodily afflictions that included miscarriage and abortion, venereal disease, and tuberculosis. Offering a thorough and provocative reading of Mansfield's major texts, Illness, Gender, and Writing shows how Mansfield negotiated her illnesses in a way that sheds new light on the study of women'screativity. Mansfield's drive toward self-integration, Burgan concludes, was her strategy for writing--and for staying alive.</p>
<p>""An outstanding psychobiographical study of Mansfield's life and creative struggle. It provides solid commentary on themajor stories and will be cited and debated by all subsequent Mansfield scholars. It is the most sustained analysis of Mansfield's psychological conflicts--and the way those conflicts produce literary texts--and a strong addition to the new tradition of 'body criticism.'""--Steven Gould Axelrod, University of California, Riverside</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1684499886 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",38.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/35/9780801848735.jpg,Success,108,17.5

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Madeleine Blais's book takes the reader through a season in the history of the Lady Hurricanes of Amherst, Massachusetts, from tryouts and practices during the regular season up through the final championship game. The result is a moving narrative that captures the complexities of girls' experiences in high school, sports, and society. It is a compelling and touching literary exploration of one group of girls' fight for success and respect... and a dramatization of the success of the women's movement and a testimony to all the changes yet to come.

But what are they like to live in? And particularly for women?

The book explores the impact of these differences on gender relations and the lives of the very poorest men and women. Dr Thorbek, a Danish sociologist, discusses how gender identity is defined; the contradictions between culture as publicly expressed and privately practised in women's daily activities; and how female identity may be understood in each country.

She discusses surgery and its options, life after mastectomy, treatment alternatives—including diet, herbs, acupuncture, manual lymph drainage, and yoga—as well as spiritual and emotional rehabilitation. She stresses the connection between the destruction of the environment and our deteriorating health. To cure the breast cancer epidemic, she insists, we must look beyond the disease and beyond our selves to heal our planet.</p>
<p>Currently, one out of every nine American women will hear the dreaded diagnosis of breast cancer at some time in her life—every twelve minutes this year a woman will die of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Despite advanced technology and early detection, incidence of the disease is actually rising while long-term survival rates are not.</p>
<p>The author points out the need to focus on prevention and political action. She shows how to start a grassroots organization, and offers advice for supporting loved ones with the disease.</p>

Sports are central to American culture and the socialization of children, yet the ""manly"" sports world rarely offers women a level playing field. Despite laws to the contrary, all-male teams routinely garner a vastly disproportionate share of college athletic budgets; despite two decades of ""sensitivity,"" men's sports are still a fertile breeding ground for Neanderthal attitudes about women; and despite increased awareness of sexual harassment, affairs between male coaches and underage female players are commonplace and gang rape of college women by male athletes has almost become a cliche. As women have become increasingly involved in sports, those ""manly"" American sports - football, basketball, hockey - have seen an enormous explosion in popularity, at least partly because they are seen as an inviolably male domain. Many women are finding that participation in sports can make them healthier, happier, more confident in their own abilities, more at home in their own skins, better able to compete with men in the workplace. Is this what men are fleeing when they watch football? Astute, provocative, and full of original research, Mariah Burton Nelson's book paves the way for a new awareness of the American culture of sports and its pervasive effects on both women and men.

                        <p>What can sports tell us about the relationship between men and women in America? Astute, provacative, and full of original research, this book paves the way for a new awareness of the influence of sports on American culture and relationships, for more constructive interaction among people of both sexes.

Vanished, never to be seen again. There were no portents, no notes, no bodies, no clue as to where they went or whether they would ever come back again. People woke to find their lovers no longer beside them. Children woke to find their parents missing, parents woke to empty cribs. Neighbors found empty houses, empty apartment buildings. Civilization collapsed. After a few months of violence spawned by fear and rage, a measure of peace was restored in the Bay Area. Enclaves formed and established defense pacts against the wandering bands of fanatics. They set about surviving, renewing contact with the rest of the world, establishing trading ties with each other, and trying to discover what had caused the Vanishing. Now, thirty years after the Disappearance, Dr. Easterman is coming across the continent from the Carnegie Institute to work with the Hackers Center in Silicon Valley, continuing a promising line of research on what caused the cataclysmic event. At the House, where a community of survivors has made a good life while continuing to build the Winchester Mansion, a young woman named Renzie is in the middle of the political struggles between various groups in the Valley. And up in the Oakland Hills a huge band of Heaven Bounders is gathering. The 'Bounders believe that the Vanishing was Judgement Day, and the Vanished have ascended to heaven. They believe that the only thing holding back their own salvation is the disbelief of others - disbelief that is manifested in building houses and growing food. If those others were dead, the Heaven Bounders believe, then Judgement would be fulfilled, and they would join their loved ones in Heaven.                        <p>It happened one night, without warning: 90% of the human race disappeared without a trace. There were no bodies and no clue as to where they went or whether they would ever return. After years of violence spawned by fear and rage, an uneasy peace is restored.

<p>The expulsion from school of their eldest son shatters the middle-class security of Maggie, a writer, and Charlie, a journalist. Since childhood, Toby has been diffident and self-absorbed, but the threat of drug taking, and his refusal (or inability) to discuss his evident unhappiness, disturbs them sufficiently to seek professional help. Veering between private agony and public cheerfulness, Maggie and Charlie struggle to support their son and cope with the reactions—and advice—of friends and relatives. Toby's situation is explored with great tenderness, while Maggie's grief and self-recrimination are rigorously, if compassionately, observed.&nbsp;This is a novel that raises fundamental questions about parents and their children, and offers tentative hope but no tidy solutions.</p>",en,New Ed,"Height: 7.83463 Inches, Length: 6.02361 Inches, Weight: 136 Grams, Width: 0.55118 Inches",16.44,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/33/9781853813733.jpg,Success,91,17.5

Stylishly written and featuring a wealth of illustrations, Consuming Angels demonstrates how advertisements picked up hedonistic patterns in Victorian culture, glorified the culture's consumerism, and mythologized a middle-class life which offered prosperity for all. Since advertisements appealed to female as well as male consumers, Lori Anne Loeb argues that on some level these advertising images must have touched on the Victorian woman's perception of herself as a powerful force in the home. And she finds in the Victorian conception of heroism democratic aspirations that reveal the origins of the twentieth-century's democracy of consumption, a society held together by a shared culture of consumerism. This richly researched book will appeal to historians, students, and anyone interested in examining the prominent role advertising played in reflecting and shaping Victorian social values and ideals.",en,1,"Height: 9.56 Inches, Length: 6.37 Inches, Weight: 1.32718281724 Pounds, Width: 0.779 Inches",155.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/69/9780195085969.jpg,Success,109,17.5

The contributors, including therapists and fat activists, aim to disconnect the issues of food intake and eating disorders from those of weight. They share personal and professional experiences of challenging fat oppression, offer strategies for therapists to rid themselves and their clients of fat oppressive attitudes, and most importantly, they confront long-held cultural myths that fat is unhealthy, and that fat women are physically unfit and are in hiding from their sexuality or personal power.</p><p>A practical and informative resource for therapists, especially those who work with fat women or who themselves struggle with issues of feeling critical of their own body size, <b>Overcoming Fear of Fat</b> will also be a valuable guide for fat women who wish to feel supported in their struggle for self-worth and respect.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.35 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.26 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/15/9780918393715.jpg,Success,47,17.5

The baby's here, he's healthy. That's the most important thing, isn't it? Few women planning a pregnancy or anticipating childbirth would dispute that the safe birth of a healthy child is their primary concern. Even when this happy outcome is achieved, however, the process of childbirth itself can wreak havoc on a woman's emotional and physiological well-being--especially when unforeseen medical complications change the expected course of labor and delivery. Rebounding From Childbirth--the first book to focus exclusively on the mother's feelings about a difficult birth--shows how traumatic childbirth forces a woman to suddenly relinquish cherished hopes for her experience of actually becoming a mother. Amid the joys of a healthy baby, the mother's feelings of anger, grief, failure and disappointment often get scant attention from family, friends and medical personnel. Drawing from her own life as a professional counselor and mother of three, Lynn Madsen argues that a woman should not underestimate her own need to recover emotionally and physiologically from a violent birth experience. Without true healing, Madsen's analysis reveals, a new mother's suppressed sense of loss and pain can affect her relationships with her baby and husband, her body image, her feelings about going back to work, even her hopes for future pregnancies and births. Through her own story and those of other women, Madsen offers comfort, hope, and an intensely personal perspective to new mothers who feel alone with a range of negative feelings about childbirth. Taking a dual stance as counselor and mother, she structures self-analytical questions and outlines techniques such as journal and letter writing to help the reader begin the healing journey. For obstetricians, nurses, midwives, new mothers and mothers-to-be, Rebounding From Childbirth provides moving insight and counsel on a difficult subject.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1401452 Inches, Weight: 0.62611282408 pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/80/9780897893480.jpg,Success,104,17.5

For months, even years, they faced the constant danger of discovery, fabricating new identities at a young age, sacrificing their childhoods to save their lives. These secret survivors have suppressed these painful memories for decades. Now, in The Hidden Children, twenty-three adult survivors share their moving wartime experiences — some for the first time.</p>
<p>There is Rosa, who hid in an impoverished one-room farmhouse with three others, sleeping on a clay pallet behind a stove; Renee, who posed as a Catholic and was kept in a convent by nuns who knew her secret; and Richard, who lived in a closet with his family for thirteen months. Their personal stories of belief and determination give a voice, at last, to the forgotten. Inspiring and life-affirming, The Hidden Children is an unparalleled document of witness, discovery, and the miracle of human courage.</p>


                        <p>In riveting first-person accounts, twenty-three adult survivors share the memories many had long supressed--how they lived in constant danger of discovery, fabricated new identities, and risked life, health and sanity to escape Nazi torture. Here, too, is how they grew, battled the guilt of surviving, and found the spirit to love and to heal.

At forty-five, Linda Green is a statistical norm: a working mother of two children who lives with her second husband in a Boston suburb. But no life is a mere statistic, and the story of Linda Green has the trajectory and the power of a novel. At the age of five, pretty Linda was her parents' princess, at sixteen she was a cheerleader, but by the time she was twenty she and her high-school-sweetheart husband were moving down an uncharted road marked the 1960s. How and why Linda moved from being the girl next door to starting a commune and experimenting with drugs and open marriage to being the controversial suburban mother and teacher she is now is the frame that holds this story together. But it's Cheever's talent for intimately, and honestly, describing the unique social, intellectual, and psychological pressures women like Linda confront that infuses this story with its harsh, eloquent beauty.

                        <p>An acclaimed writer takes a revisionist feminist look at what it means to be a woman, mother and worker today with this powerful true story of the life of Linda Green. How and why Linda goes from being the girl next door to starting a commune and experimenting with drugs to being a controversial suburban mother and teacher is the frame that holds this story together.

Janet Malcolm brings her shrewd intelligence to bear on the legend of Sylvia Plath and the wildly productive industry of Plath biographies. Features a new Afterword by Malcolm.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The story of the marriage of poets Sylvia Plath (1933-1963) and Ted Hughes has continued to fascinate readers and biographers since Plath's suicide, as somehow representative of our common lot and yet also inscrutably dramatic. In a cunningly resourceful look at Plath's life, at her posthumous existence and at the struggles of her biographers to penetrate, document and interpret her history and her husband's role in it, Malcolm seizes the opportunity to reflect on the moral contradictions of biography itself (``the biographer . . . is like the professional burglar''), somewhat as she examined journalism in <I>The Journalist and the Murderer</I> . The book, reprinted from the New Yorker , is a highly skillful, intrinsically arguable exploration of mixed motives, considering in detail the characters of several figures: Anne Stevenson, one of Plath's biographers; Hughes, whom she regards with more sympathy than many do; his sister Olwyn; and some of Plath's friends and neighbors (e.g., A. Alvarez). Malcolm's characteristic mingling of observation and criticism, her self-scrutiny, her finely modulated tonal shifts and the strategies of her skepticism expose, with a generous range of nuance, the stories that tend to emerge from any story and complicate it--while writing one herself that is of surpassing interest.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/03/9780679751403.jpg,Success,115,17.5

<br>
Writing provides a valuable medium through which the voices of women artists can be heard. Although all artists' writings are important sources for analyzing the art they have produced, those by women artists have had special significance. While artists of both genders ask similar questions (such as What is an artist? Am I an artist?), women artists have often had another level to negotiate to claim their artistic vocations. In this volume, fourteen contemporary women artists articulate the personal and aesthetic issues that shape their lives and their works.<br>
<br>
Like the earlier, critically acclaimed <i>Voicing Our Visions: Writings by Women Artists</i> (Universe, 1991), which offered the writings of 19th and 20th-century women artists, much of the material in this sequel is only now made widely accessible. Each artist is introduced by a representative work of art and brief biographical sketch that examines her place in the history of art.

                        <p>Women artist, such as Barbara Kruger, Eva Hess, Mary Kelly, and Adrian Piper, give voice to the visions that shape their work. This lively collection of texts provides a clear understanding and deeper enjoyment of the work of these leading women artists. 102 illustrations.

—Bernie S. Siegel, M.D., Author of <i>Love, Medicine, and Miracles</i></b><br>
Attitudes about breast cancer diagnosis are changing, and women and their families are becoming more assertive about managing their disease. They know that more choices are available now than ever before, and they are willing to make them. <br>
This book encourages you to take control. Cathy Hitchcock and Steve Austin, N.D., have written a book for women who are ready to actively participate in their diagnosis and treatment. <br>
A husband and wife team, Hitchcock and Austin walk you step-by-step through each part of diagnosis, treatment (both conventional and alternative), and prevention (including prevention of a recurrence). With the help of a flow chart, they examine different diagnosis options. They also suggest questions to ask your doctor and offer checklists, summaries, and overviews. <br>
Interwoven with all this information, Cathy shares her personal story as a breast cancer survivor. She describes her ordeal upon discovering the lump and the transitions she has gone through to live with the diagnosis in a life-affirming way. Unlike many other breast cancer patients, Cathy didn’t simply accept the choices offered by medical doctors. Instead, with the help of her husband, she studied the research and made her own decisions about conventional and alternative treatments.

                        <p>For women who want to actively participate in their diagnosis and treatment, this book explores pertinent medical information about breast cancer currently neglected by popular breast cancer books and by both conventional and alternative medicine.

Many women realize they must leave behind the traditional concepts and images for a more authentic spirituality. Yet they find to their dismay that the male symbols of God are deeply rooted in their psyches, and difficult to transform. A God Who Looks Like Me shows how the patriarchal images of early experience have wounded women and still stand in the way of a self-defined spirituality. In this book, the poignant personal memories of women of all ages and lifestyles are interwoven with the collective story of women buried in the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Bible. Together, these women explore the lost glory of Eve, Lilith, and Mary - and of other forgotten figures who speak to our lives in a society that prefers men. They teach us to plumb the depths of our relationships with our mothers, our bodies, and ourselves; our sexuality and vulnerability; and our journey into old age.

In a postmodern world where old uncertainties are undermined and identities fragmented, the way forward for those working with popular culture has become less clear. In contrast to more pessimistic readings of the possibilities of postmodernity, <i>Postmodernism and Popular Culture</i> engages with postmodernity as a space for social change and political transformation.<p>Ranging widely over cultural theory and popular culture, Angela McRobbie looks at everyday life as an eclectic and invigorating arena for the interplay of different cultures and identities. McRobbie assesses the contribution of key figures in cultural and postcolonial theory--Susan Sontag, Walter Benjamin and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak--and surveys the landscape of today's youth and popular culture, from salvation army fashion to the rave scene, from moral panic to teen magazines.<p>Throughout, Angela McRobbie argues for a commitment to cultural studies as an ""undisciplined discipline,"" reforming and re-inventing itself as circumstances demand, for the importance of ethnography and empirical work, dealing with living voices and spoken language, and for the necessity for feminists to continually ask questions about the meaning of a feminist theory in a postmodern world.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.62 Inches, Length: 6.78 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches",46.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/32/9780415077132.jpg,Success,116,17.5

In fact, diets turn us into compulsive eaters, driven to eat even when we are not hungry, spending our lives obsessed with food and weight. Yet, as all too many women also know, understanding that diets are counterproductive, and swearing them off forever, are two entirely different matters. In this revolutionary new book, Munter and Hirschmann explore the myriad reasons why women cling to diets despite overwhelming evidence of their ineffectiveness. They know that millions of women, of all shapes and sizes, wake up every morning, look in the mirror, and say ""Yuck."" Munter and Hirschmann call this syndrome ""Bad Body Fever."" They have discovered that dislike of their bodies is the single most pervasive reason women stay stuck in the diet/binge cycle. They also understand that when we say, ""I feel fat,"" we are really speaking in code, disguising the true feelings and concerns that are vital to our lives. Part I, ""Reclaiming Your Body,"" describes Bad Body Fever and its resilience, and shows how our ""bad body thoughts"" are clues to our emotional lives. Part II, ""Reclaiming Your Appetite,"" explores the difficulties women have when we stop dieting and reviews the Overcoming Overeating approach, which replaces dieting with demand feeding. Part III, ""Reclaiming Yourself,"" teaches us how to think about our problems rather than eat about them. Most important, Munter and Hirschmann show us how to create an internal caretaker who can provide us with what we really need - unconditional acceptance, attention, and empowerment so that food can resume its proper place in our lives. Based on the authors' research findings and more than twenty-five years of experience working with women who suffer from Bad Body Fever and compulsive eating. When Women Stop Hating Their Bodies is filled with workable solutio

They encourage women to move beyond obsession with what's wrong with their bodies to an understanding of the true feelings that are vital to their lives.

This Fascinating Book Examines The Motive Of Revenge As A Catalyst For The Creative Process. Evoking Bloomsbury And Paris In The Twenties And Thirties, Acclaimed Biographer Louise De Salvo Focuses On Four Famous Literary Partnerships Where The Written Word Was Used As A Weapon Of Revenge. Like Her Pioneering Virginia Woolf: The Impact Of Childhood Sexual Abuse On Her Life And Work, Conceived With Malice Challenges Our Conceptions Of How And Why Great Works Of Literature Are Written. The Ideal Marriage Of Leonard And Virginia Woolf Not Only Linked Leonard Woolf To A Partner Far More Talented Than He But Elevated Him To A Social Class That Dismissed Him As The Son Of A Jewish Shopkeeper. His Retaliation Was The Novel The Wise Virgins, Actually Penned During The Couple's Honeymoon. It Portrayed A Thinly Disguised Virginia As Deranged And Sexually Inadequate, Sending The Shattered Bride Spiralling Toward Depression And Attempted Suicide. The Mercurial Relationship Between D. H. Lawrence, A Coal Miner's Son, And His Patron Lady Ottoline Morrell, Whose List Of Lovers Included Bertrand Russell, Roger Fry, And Henry Lamb, Began As A Union Of Soulmates But Deteriorated Into An Enmity That Spawned Lawrence's Vicious Portrait Of Her As The Morally Corrupt Hermione Roddice In Women In Love. The Legendary Writer Djuna Barnes Reveals The Psychic Wound That Lay At The Core Of Her Classic Novels Nightwood And Ryder - And That At Last Was Excruciatingly Exposed In Her Final Major Work, The Antiphon, The Amazing Play That Discloses A Family History Of Multiple Incest And Child Abuse, Making Her Pain-filled And Boldly Experimental Work All Too Comprehensible. Henry Miller's Wife, June, The Beautiful, Strung-out, Coked-up Taxi Dancer Who Kept Him Up All Night Talking About Writers, Who Lived With Him And Her Lesbian Lover In A Squalid Brooklyn Apartment, Nearly Drove Him Mad. But She Also Became His Lodestone Over Forty Years Of Writing, From His First Novel, Crazy Cock - Only Recently Published - Through Tropic Of Cancer And His Later Classics. Full Of Enticing Literary Gossip, Conceived With Malice Is Also A Daring Exploration Of The Dark Side Of The Creative Process, Analyzing Much Never-before-addressed Material In Each Of These Writers' Lives. Blending Consummate Scholarship With Great Narrative Skill, Louise Desalvo Vividly Describes How These Great Literary Figures Each Perceived An Attack On The Self - And Struck Back Through Their Art, Creating Lasting Monuments To Their Deepest Hurts And Darkest Obsessions. 1.

                        <p>The great German mystic Meister Eckhart remains one of the most fascinating figures in Western thought. Revived interest in Eckhart's mysticism has been matched, and even surpassed, by the study of the women mystics of the late 13th century. This book argues that Eckhart's thought cannot be fully be understood until it is viewed against the background of the breakthroughs made by the women mystics who preceded him.
