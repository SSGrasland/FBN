0-316-50477-7,Riding for My Life,"Krone, Julie, Richardson, Nancy",Little Brown & Co,212,1995,,Hardcover,"Julie Krone has become the most celebrated female jockey in the history of horse racing. Among her many record-breaking accomplishments are being the first woman to win the Belmont Stakes, to win five races in one day at a New York track, and to compete in a Breeders Cup race. The winner of over $56 million in purses, Julie Krone has made more than 2,800 trips to the winner's circle. Despite her natural talent, Julie's road to success was anything but smooth. In a sport hostile to women, she had to curse louder, fight harder, and, above all, race faster in order to stand her ground against the men of the trade. A high school dropout with divorced parents, Julie faced personal hardship as well. As she struggled to reach the top, her mother was suddenly diagnosed with cancer, and Julie fell victim to periods of loneliness and depression, overcame a drug problem, and suffered a broken back that would pull her out of racing for four months. Julie's most devastating setback, however, was a near-fatal accident in August 1993, when a 1,200-pound horse hit her directly above the heart. But the unstoppable Julie would not be beaten. With a driving will to win (and with the help of fourteen screws and two plates in her ankle) Julie Krone is back - and riding for her life.

                        <p>Julie Krone is, without a doubt, the most celebrated female jockey in history. This is an intimate encounter with the champion, whose road to success was anything but a smooth ride. In a sport unaccustomed to women, she had to curse louder, fight harder and, above all, race faster in order to stand her ground against the men in her trade. Photos.

Award-winning journalist Jan Goodwin traveled through ten Islamic countries and interviewed hundreds of Muslim women, from professionals to peasants, from royalty to rebels. The result is an unforgettable, blistering journey into a world where women are confined, even killed, for the sake of a ""code of honor"" created and zealously enforced by men. This is a world where grandmothers can be whipped for showing a tiny lock of hair, rape victims are imprisoned for ""fornication,"" doctors surgically restore hymens for brides because nonvirgins can be killed by male relatives, and American converts to Islam accept their husbands' polygamy. Price of Honor brings to life a world in which women have become pawns in a bitter power game. Here is a provocative look inside Muslim society -- and a ringing wake-up call to the world.

                        <p>Islamic women, the badges of honor for their men, speak out in a timely and stunning book that takes us into the volatile heart and mystery of Islam. A provocative portrait of a culture that has become crucially entwined with our own.

Since its initial publication in 1994, <I>Coming of Age in America</I> has evolved from a groundbreaking collection of underrepresented voices into a timeless album of unforgettable literature. Its editor, Mary Frosch, has since created a series of celebrated anthologies, including <I>Coming of Age Around the World</I> and the forthcoming <I>Coming of Age in the 21st Century</I>. A wonderfully readable collection, this is a marvelous resource for those looking for stories that illustrate the convergence of cultural experience and literature.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The 20-odd short stories and novel excerpts comprising this book are all previously published works, several from critically acclaimed authors like Tobias Wolff, Paule Marshall, and National Book Award finalist Dorothy Allison.

The author explores the mystery of aging, past and present, and deals specifically with the interests, needs, and shared experiences of today's mature women. She speaks frankly about children, health, drugs, grief, memory loss, money, spirtuality, sex and much more. Many personal stories are also woven in, and there are special sections like ""House Rules for Husbands"" and ""100 Things to Do That Don't Cost Money.""</p>

Bradley envisions the ""old religion'' as a refreshing blend of classic and revisionist concepts, adding a distinct flavor to her seamless weave of history and myth. Most libraries will want this for their fantasy collections.

It Is A Powerful And Original Analysis Of The Changing Shape Of Private Life, A Profoundly Optimistic And Forward-looking Answer To The Dangerous Nuclear-family-only Nostalgia For The Fifties That Pervades The Ongoing National Debate On Family Values. Shere Hite Has Listened Carefully To The Real Stories Of Real People And Has Developed A Fascinating New Framework For Understanding Growing Up, Based On First-person Data Rather Than On A Preconceived Model Or Status Quo. In This Book, Hite Becomes The First Person To Give Theoretical Legitimacy To All Of The Infinite Ways That We Live As Families, Whether As Single Parents, As Same-sex Parents, In Traditional Family Groups, Or Alone. In The Hite Report On The Family Hite Challenges Established Views, Arguing That The Family Is Not Collapsing But Being Democratized. Hite Introduces A New Theory Of Male Eroticism By Investigating Why So Many Men And Boys Confuse Sex And Violence; She Presents A Lively New Portrait Of Girls Questioning Their Own Sexual Identity; And She Confounds Assumptions Of A Female Puberty Necessarily Parallel To The Male. Her Questions Are Provocative And Intimate: Do You Know How Your Parents Felt About Having You? Did Your Father Or Mother Look At Pornography? At What Age Were Your Children Closest To You? Do Men Raised By Single Mothers Enjoy Better Relationships With Women? Has Children's Respect For Their Mothers Increased With The Rise In Single And Employed Mothers?

When the coroner finds that Henry Hamilton was suffocated in his sleep, Marti and her partner, Jessenovik, know it's likely he was killed by someone he knew. They also know that Hamilton, a deacon of Mount Gethsemane Baptist Church, is the stepfather of Denise Stevens, a juvenile probation officer who has helped them on other cases. Hoping to prove that Denise is not a murder suspect Marti looks into the victim's church-centered community and his family's troubled past. But the closer Marti gets to identifying the killer, the more protective Denise becomes toward her mother and sisters: Gladys, whose lifelong struggle for respect may have taken a dangerous turn; Belle, a nightclub singer whose flamboyant style has a desperate edge; and Terri, her father's favorite, who feels trapped in her marriage to an older man. As the police learn more about who Hamilton really was, Denise withdraws further from the people who want to help her until Marti is forced to assume that she and her sisters are keeping a terrible secret.

                        <p>Gladys Hamilton has been planning to kill Henry, her husband of 35 years. But when she finds him dead, it appears natural causes beat her to it. But when detective Marti MacAlister discovers that Henry has been suffocated, he realizes that the key to finding Henry's murderer is hidden in the family's legacy of shame and abuse. Martin's Press.

Today, discussions of lesbian sex abound with such terms as romantic friendships, stealth lesbians, and genitally sexual. As we approach the end of the twentieth century, lesbian sexuality remains hotly contested ground. What exactly qualifies as lesbian sex? What is the relationship, if any, between lesbian erotica and heterosexual pornography? How did the issue of sex in lesbian communities come to be such a fiercely debated subject?</p>
<p><i>Lesbian Erotics</i> is the first anthology to investigate the cultural production of sexually charged images of lesbians in film, law, literature, and popular culture in general. The contributors address an enormous range of sexualities and fora in which these sexualities flourish. In her chapter, <i>Not Tonight, Dear, I'm Deconstructing a Headache: Confessions of a Lesbian Sex Therapist</i>, Marny Hall illustrates how difficult some women find it to maintain erotic tension in lesbian relationships. Elizabeth Meese grapples with increasingly complex sexual identities in cyperspace. Kitty Tsui, cover model for <i>On Our Backs</i>, relays how she developed her own body into an art form in order to combat stereotypes of passive and invisible Asian women.</p>
<p>This work, as Karla Jay writes in the introduction, invites readers to consider the implications, variations, and complexities of lesbian erotics. In the end, it is our sexual lives that mark us as outlaws. Therefore, we need to investigate and engage representations of our sexuality to define for ourselves, if we so choose, the scope, shape, and permutations of lesbian erotics.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.85098433132 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/59/9780814742259.jpg,Success,113,18.1

It is the variety of the representations of women--as gods, Madonnas, witches, and so on--that we hope to capture, in its permanence as well as its many transformations."" Informed by the work of seventy-five distinguished historians, this five-volume series sets before us an engaging, panoramic chronicle that extends from antiquity to the present day. The inaugural volume brings women from the margins of ancient history into the fore. The authors' deft analysis offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. In the minds of the ancients, the roles for which women were destined were silent ones: motherhood and homemaking, tasks relegated to obscurity by scribes who focused exclusively on the deeds of men. Even the census neglected women; in Rome, only heiresses were counted. But the dearth of information about women in official archives and the near absence of writing by women from this era stand in stark contrast to the astonishing profusion of texts and images created by men that are concerned with women and gender. The number of women's representations is astonishing. The authors draw upon sources ranging from gravestones to floor plans, from stele inscriptions to papyrus rolls, from vase paintings to Greek and Roman literary works, to illustrate how representations of women evolved during this age. They journey into the minds of men--from the Greeks imagining their goddesses to the Church Fathers inventing the figure of the martyred female saint--and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes. The authors explore select aspects o

 This book looks at both canonical and non-canonical works, over a variety of fiction and nonfiction genres, that offer counter-readings of familiar Western narratives. Nancy Walker begins by probing women's revisions of two narrative traditions pervasive in Western culture: the biblical story of Adam and Eve, and the traditional fairy tales that have served as paradigms of women's behavior and expectations. She goes on to examine the works of a wide range of writers, from contemporaries Marilynne Robinson, Ursula Le Guin, Anne Sexton, Fay Weldon, Angela Carter, and Margaret Atwood to precursors Caroline Kirkland, Fanny Fern, Mary De Morgan, Mary Louisa Molesworth, Edith Nesbit, and Evelyn Sharp.<br>",en,1998,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.19 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/64/9780292790964.jpg,Success,72,18.1

Barely five years later, with The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window, Hansberry gave us an unforgettable portrait of a man struggling with his individual fate in an age of racial and social injustice.

 In this study, Karin Tice explores the impact of the commercialization of mola production on Kuna society, one of the most important, yet least studied, social changes to occur in San Blas in this century. She argues that far from being a cohesive force, commercialization has resulted in social differentiation between the genders and among Kuna women residing in different parts of the region. She also situates this political economic history within a larger global context of international trade, political intrigue, and ethnic tourism to offer insights concerning commercial craft production that apply far beyond the Kuna case.<br>
 These findings, based on extensive ethnographic field research, constitute important reading for scholars and students of anthropology, women's studies, and economics. They also offer an indigenous perspective on the twentieth-century version of Columbus's landing--the arrival of a cruise ship bearing wealthy, souvenir-seeking tourists.<br>

An American public smitten with her wit, frankness, and ""unladylike"" bravado helped her become an American legend. In Babe, Susan Cayleff offers a comprehensive, in-depth biography of a woman who was a great athlete at a time when women's roles and opportunities were severely limited. Through interviews with Babe's friends and family, golf peers, and medical personnel, Cayleff sensitively reveals the life and probes the legend of this unusual American hero. Included is a for-the-record discussion of the remarkable love Babe shared with Betty Dodd, the young golfer who was her constant companion in her last years. Stricken with cancer in her prime, Babe went public as a self-help role model able to beat the disease. Her bravery further endeared her to the American public.

In Our Own Voices reclaims and affirms the previously ignored historical contributions of women by recovering many long-silenced voices. Here, woven together into a multicultural, multiethnic, and multifaith tapestry, are many of their remarkable contributions to American religion written in their own words. Restored for contemporary women and men are the lyric voices of women representing various locales, time periods, and religious viewpoints: indigenous women, early colonists, religious council leaders and reformers, slaves and free women, commune leaders, Christian lesbians, witches, and Islamic and Buddhist feminists. Controversial issues are examined, including the clash of Catholic nuns and lay women with the hierarchy of priests, bishops, and the Pope; black women's experience with slavery and more recently with the womanist liberation movement; and the rights of women to lead and hold official office within their own religious faith. Illuminating firsthand accounts - selections from diaries, letters, civil and religious documents, and formal histories - re-create in vivid and compelling detail the intricate fabric of women's religious aspirations, struggles, and accomplishments over the last four centuries, including: a pioneer nun's account of her meeting with Billy the Kid; Mother Jones urging miners to strike to ""get a little bit of heaven before you die""; and a letter written by the founder of Hadassah stating her decision to say Kaddish for her mother. Included among these works are the writings of such notable matriarchs as Mother Jones, Zora Neale Hurston, Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, Lucretia Mott, Toni Morrison, Las Hermanas, Kathryn Kuhlman, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The body of their work and the spirit of their words continue to speak to both the minds and the hearts of women and men everywhere.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 2.15 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/33/9780060668433.jpg,Success,39,18.1

Set mainly in contemporary Hawaii, it is a spectacular odyssey through fire and water, a journey that begins in the nineteenth century with the fateful meeting of a Yankee sailor and the runaway daughter of a Tahitian chief. Sweeping from that distant past into the present turbulent decade, Kiana Davenport has woven an astonishing, compassionate portrait of her people, one of personal and political complexities - a surreal and provocative, wise and erotic tale of villains and dreamers, of ""stone-eaters"" and queens, of revolutionaries, and of lepers and healers. Central to all is the matriarch Pono, a statuesque, pure-blooded Hawaiian, a kahuna, or seer, whose past is shrouded in mystery. Pono's love for Duke Kealoha - a man hidden from the world, a man his daughters and granddaughters have never knownis one of the most haunting love stories of our time, a love that lasts through sixty years, a love so profound she ""dares everything, commits every conceivable act for him."" As the novel opens, Pono's four granddaughters are converging on her run-down coffee plantation on the Big Island, summoned by Pono in her eighty-fourth year. United by their fear of and devotion to Pono, each woman is of ""mixed blood"" parentage: Ming - Hawaiian-Chinese, is a lover of art and music, who suffers from lupus; Vanya - Hawaiian-Filipino, is a lawyer and a fiery political activist; Rachel - Hawaiian-Japanese, is a great beauty, obsessed with her Yakuza husband; JessHawaiian-Caucasian, is a veterinarian, whose pale skin makes her ""inferior"" in Pono's eyes. Never having known their true genealogy ""Pono's girls,"" as they are called, have led tormented, scattered lives. Now, caught up in Pono's spell, feeling a sense of ""immi</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A sprawling but compelling first novel, Davenport's gargantuan family epic centers on the awe-inspiring Hawaiian matriarch Pono, a prophet gifted with magic powers, and her four estranged, mixed-marriage granddaughters. The book begins in 1834 with Pono's forebears, a shipwrecked Yankee sailor who had resorted to cannibalism, and a runaway Tahitian princess, and covers large chunks of Hawaiian history before ending up on a present-day island coffee plantation. Using flashbacks and detours, the novel chronicles how granddaughters Ming, Vanya, Rachel and Jess reclaim their heritage and achieve reconciliations with Pono, who terrifies them--she can metamorphose into a sea creature and live for days in the ocean--but commands their love and respect. Pono periodically goes on unexplained voyages to visit the girls' grandfather, Duke, a leper deeply ashamed of his putrefying limbs. A digression describes the history of the disease and treatment of its victims. Other sections evoke life on a 19th-century whaler, and offer a history of Hawaii's labor-union movement, the story of a drug-addicted Vietnam vet and cameo appearances of such real-life figures as Queen Lil'uokalani and F.D.R. Between wars, plagues, uprisings and earthquakes the book has a surfeit of events, but for the most part Davenport juggles the elements admirably as she moves from Hawaiian rain forests to downtown Manhattan, slipping easily from the fantastic to the actual. Breathtaking images studded throughout the densely poetic descriptive passages more than compensate for the occasional clumsy effort at stream-of-consciousness writing. Author tour.

Gabrielia De Ferrari, the author of the acclaimed novel A Cloud on Sand, grew up in Peru, the daughter of gringos, or foreigners: her parents had come from Italy as newlyweds to set down roots in an exotic and alluring country far from home. De Ferrari recalls her privileged upbringing in the small desert town of Tacna, at the foothills of the silent Andes: the wonders of her mother's inventive cuisine, an inspired melding of Italian and Peruvian ingredients; her friendship with her Peruvian neighbor Senorita Luisa, doomed to be an old maid because her betrothed left her for someone else; her ties to Saturnina, the Indian maid who taught her about curses and miracles; and her admiration for her father, the trusted sage of their town. Eventually De Ferrari attended college in the United States, where she is called a Latina. She married an American and raised her children, as her parents did, in an adopted country far from home. Today, as she contemplates her life in America, where she feels both estranged and accepted, she realizes how much Peru peoples the landscape of her memory and remains a lodestar. Gringa Latina, a book of recollections, celebration, and self-definition, is the enchanting result.

Set in Cleveland, the novel opens in 1967 as Evan Eichenbaum suffers a heart attack; it then moves back to the thirties and early forties before coming to a heartwrenching end in the present. Three generations of the Eichenbaum family, each in its turn, face the same crucial question: How is it possible to keep those we love safe when the world at large is beyond our control? In the 1930s, Evan and his wife, Vera - once immigrants to America - try to save their Jewish relatives left in Europe, only to be challenged by hostile U.S. immigration laws; during World War II, they try to shield their sons Teddy and Hankus from the draft; in the present, their daughter, Joy, and her children face the peril of AIDS. Marcie Hershman makes these characters come alive in ways that will astonish you, and she depicts so vividly the events that threaten them that it seems as if you are seeing history from an entirely new vantage point. Although the horrors of the past sixty years form the background of the narrative, Safe in America is in fact a love story: of parents for children, of brothers for sisters, of all the pain, grief, and grace that are part of the complex ways we are bound to one another by blood. In exquisite prose and with an understanding of history as subtle as it is profound, Marcie Hershman looks into the heart of a family to reveal the real triumphs that exist within devastation, and tells a story you will never forget.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/45/9780060171445.jpg,Success,125,18.1

By the end of the year the U.S. was at war, and columnist Kathy Hogan's weekly dispatches turned to soldiers, rationing, and the barbed wire that lined the sand dunes around her weathered cottage. Today, fifty years later, Kathy Hogan's writings provide a window onto how one Pacific Northwest community responded to World War II. Cohassett Beach Chronicles, a collection of Hogan's columns from the war years, offers a remarkable social history of the war at home. The attack on Pearl Harbor brought U.S. troops to Cohassett Beach and to towns up and down the West Coast. With sharp wit and perception, Hogan writes of civilians valiantly coping with this friendly occupation and wartime scarcity. Her neighbors - loggers, commercial fishermen, Finnish cranberry farmers - learn to live with blackouts, blimps, and a ban on beachcombing. From her victory garden, Hogan watches troops - city boys unnerved by the tall timber and farmers' sons in awe of the ocean - come and go. Hogan's weekly descriptions of life on the home front capture America's wartime mood.

Exploring The Startling History Of The Heterosexual Concept, Jonathan Ned Katz Reveals That As Late As The 1920s, Heterosexuality Was Still Defined In A Major American Dictionary As Morbid Sexual Passion For One Of The Opposite Sex. It Was Only Through A Slow Process That Heterosexuality Became This Society's Dominant Norm. Analyzing The Work Of Such Pioneering Students Of Sexuality As Sigmund Freud And Richard Von Krafft-ebing, Katz Considers The Effects Of Their Ideas About The Sacred Primacy Of Heterosexuality On Both Scientific Literature And Popular Culture. He Also Examines The Varied Commentaries On Heterosexuality By Such Contemporary Writers As James Baldwin, Betty Friedan, Adrienne Rich, Kate Millett, And Michel Foucault.--book Jacket.

This book documents a wide variety of different forms of feminist activism in the 1990s, from organisations such as Rights for Women and Southall Black Sisters to Asian Women's Work in Refuges. It raises questions about the meaning of feminist activism and its interpretation within women's studies and other academic disciplines. The chapters suggest, against much current representation within women's studies and elsewhere, that feminism is still alive.; With a comprehensive introduction providing an historical overview of the development of feminist activism from second wave feminism onwards, this text is intended to be of use as a resource for all students of women's studies and related courses.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Essays document feminist activism in the UK, describing the work of organizations such as Southall Black Sisters, Lesbians Organizing Together, and Women Against Fundamentalism, and highlighting the institutionalization and professionalization of the women's movement since the 1980s and its increasing diversity.

Now in their fifties, they are widowed within three months of each other. Sarah and Harriet gradually come to terms with each other, the men they buried and the life that continues to go on around them.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>It's always a pleasure to watch a writer mature, and in her 13th novel (after Hug Dancing ), Hearon offers plenty of satisfaction to the discriminating reader. Here she explores the mysteries and ironies of marriage, friendship, parentage and love with a frank, searching and compassionate eye. Friends since boarding school days, Sarah Rankin and Harriet Calhoun have lived synchronous lives in South Carolina and Texas: both married bankers, had two children and were widowed in their 50s, within a few months of each other. The way they deal with widowhood and, indeed, with their own mortality is the starting point of this engrossing novel. To Sarah, who never enjoyed the ``bondage'' of marriage and chafed over the societal biases against married women (the inability to get one's own credit card, etc.), it's a relief to live singly again. She runs a thriving custom wallpaper business, pursues a relationship with her late husband's physician. Though Harriet's marriage was little better than Sarah's, she is devastated: ``I feel like I've lost my job: wife.'' While Sarah's daughter seems obsessed with having children in quick succession, Harriet's offspring seems determined to be barren, and the younger man Harriet wants to take to bed has yet to succumb to her blandishments; but suddenly a new development wipes away all thoughts but survival. Hearon writes with energy and acuity; her wit takes the form of sharp apercus about human nature and society. If her themes are darker here than in previous books, her voice is stronger, more outspoken, and she wisely eschews easy answers to life issues. The narrative speaks instead of grace under pressure, of carrying on after loss and grief, of affirming the day and looking bravely at the future. It's a thoughtful and honest book, with real relevance to our lives.

Using journals, diaries, family letters, parts of Scottie's own unpublished memoir, and personal reminiscences of Scottie's surviving family and friends, Eleanor Lanahan has written a beautiful, intensely personal book that is as clear-eyed as it is compassionate. Spanning three generations, Scottie is as much a portrait of an American era as it is the story of a brilliant, troubled family.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 2.05 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/97/9780060171797.jpg,Success,126,18.1

Norton & Company,224,6/17/1995,,Paperback,"<p>This fascinating and revealing book is based on ten years of research during which Randall Brink brought suits against the government, interviewed key witnesses willing to talk for the first time, and made forays into the equatorial islands of the Pacific. He uncovered documents that provide strong new evidence about the circumstances of Earhart's last flight, and has used his background as a pilot to reinterpret photos and technical data that have been misunderstood until now. Meticulously pieced together is the shocking truth: the story of the Roosevelt administration's plan to turn Earhart's last flight into a mission in espionage, her capture by the Japanese, and her likely survival as a prisoner of war.</p>

This book, a comprehensive history of women in the Archaic and Classical Ages, completes our picture of ancient Greek society.<P>Largely excluded from any public role, the women of ancient Greece nonetheless appear in various guises in the art and writing of the period, and in legal documents. These representations, in Sue Blundell's analysis, reveal a great deal about women's day-to-day experience as well as their legal and economic position&#151;and how they were regarded by men. Here are women as portrayed in Homer, in Greek lyric poetry, and by the playwrights; the female nature as depicted in medical writings and by Aristotle; representations of women in sculpture and vase paintings. This is evidence filtered through a male view&#58; Sappho is the only female writer of antiquity much of whose work survives. Yet these sources and others such as regulations and law court speeches reveal a great deal about women's lives and about their status as defined by law and by custom.<P>By examining the roles that men assigned to women, the ideals they constructed for them, and the anxieties they expressed about them, Blundell sheds light on the cultural dynamics of a male-dominated society. Lively and richly illustrated, her work offers a fresh look at women in the ancient world.</p> <h3>J.M. Williams - Choice</h3> <p>Blundell offers here an excellent, brief survey of women in archaic and classical Greek art, literature, and history. It is the sole comprehensive account in English of women in ancient Greece (as opposed to Greece and Rome).

Each of their stories reveals the personal dilemma created by the societal demand for secrecy and the deep pain and intense joy associated with adoptees making contact with their birth mother. Karen March has created a compelling and informative analysis of this need of some adoptees. Little research has been done on the actual outcome of adoptee-birth parent reunion and most arguments in this controversial area are based on personal anecdotal reports. This book offers the first systematic study of the consequences of reunion.

There's Something Faintly Unconvincing About Gault (in A Competitive Field, It's Tough To Create A Really Horrific Serial Killer), And Scarpetta, Stuck With Her Own Family Troubles And Involved In A Rather Glum Affair With A Colleague, Seems To Be Running Low On Energy. Still, This Is A Compelling, Fast-moving Tale, Written In A Highly Compressed Style, And Only Readers Who Know That Cornwell Can Do Better Are Likely To Complain.

1-55885-125-9,A Perfect Silence,Alba Ambert,Arte Publico Press,199,1/31/1995,"Fiction, Fiction Subjects, Peoples & Cultures - Fiction",Hardcover,"<p>A PERFECT SILENCE is Alba Ambert's novel about a Puerto Rican woman brought up in the South Bronx and her struggles to break the cycle of poverty and oppression which has plagued her family for generations. As both child and adult, Blanca was abused by both people and the economic system the creates the meanest, most violent ghettoes. In Bianca, Ambert explores how oppression breeds violence and entraps people, even after they escape poverty and become successful. Once Bianca breaks out of the ghetto, she is not free; there is a severe emotional price to pay. She suffers the pain of living between two cultures, two languages, two ways of perceiving the world; she is caught in the emotional limbo of a dual identity.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Poet and short-story writer Ambert's first novel chronicles the harrowing tale of a young woman pulled unwillingly through life in New York's South Bronx. Blanca battles poverty, abuse and despair, but her toughest confrontation is with her own memories. ``The memory is not clear, but reeks of an atavistic sadness, passive for centuries,'' she muses. ``Atavistic sadness'' might suggest the novel is a statement on the Puerto Rican people, in which case it might have resonated. But the events of one young woman's life are doled out relentlessly to the reader like so many strikes of a hammer. The novel begins with Blanca's most recent suicide attempt-her way of fighting the persistent oppression of recollection. Yet, although the story is written partly in the first person and recounts many of Blanca's abysmal experiences, it circles around reflection without defining the core of the problem. One feels that the author is trying hard but unsuccessfully to expose a devastating truth in these pages, but the suffocating atmosphere of this relentlessly depressing story traps the reader inside Blanca's ``dark pain'' without catharsis or surcease.

These Concurrent Developments Have Led Some Observers To View This Religious Movement As A Means Of Melding Converts Into A Disciplined Work Force For Foreign Capitalists Rather Than As A Reflection Of Conscious Individual Choices Made For A Variety Of Personal, As Well As Economic, Reasons.<br> In This Pioneering Study, Elizabeth Brusco Challenges Such Assumptions And Explores The Intra-household Motivations For Evangelical Conversion In Colombia. She Shows How The Asceticism Required Of Evangelicals (no Drinking, Smoking, Or Extramarital Sexual Relations Are Allowed) Redirects Male Income Back Into The Household, Thereby Raising The Living Standard Of Women And Children. This Benefit Helps Explain The Appeal Of Evangelicalism For Women And Questions The Traditional Assumption That Organized Religion Always Disadvantages Women.<br> Brusco Also Demonstrates How Evangelicalism Appeals To Men By Offering An Alternative To The More Dysfunctional Aspects Of Machismo. Case Studies Add A Fascinating Human Dimension To Her Findings.<br> With The Challenges This Book Poses To Conventional Wisdom About Economic, Gender, And Religious Behavior, It Will Be Important Reading For A Wide Audience In Anthropology, Women's Studies, Economics, And Religion.

But to the eighteen West Virginia women Carol Giesen interviewed for this book, hard times are just everyday life.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Statistics reported in this well-researched study reveal the grim reality of daily life for coal-mining families in Appalachia. Between 1897 and 1939, nearly every day a West Virginia mining family lost a member to the mines (346 deaths per year), while dozens of men suffered injuries daily. Despite modern safety procedures and technological advances that lowered that astounding death rate to an average 22 deaths per year between 1981 and 1986, mining is still dangerous work, with cave-ins, explosions and toxic gases ever-present hazards. To find out how families deal with the stresses and strains of constant danger, Giesen, human development professor at St. Mary's college in Maryland, interviewed 18 coal miners' wives, ranging in age from late teens to the early 80s. Eschewing melodramatic anecdotes and making good use of face-to-face conversations, the author balances the interviewees' recollections of personal experiences with her own insights into the social and economic pressures of the coal-mining industry. In their own words, the women relate their domestic concerns and how they try to shield their husbands from household problems. They describe their fears of job hazards and tell how they cope with stress of strikes, layoffs, mine closings and companies that place more emphasis on profit than on safety.

Robin Gregg here draws on the words and stories of over thirty women to provide a first- hand perspective on pregnancy in the modern age.<p> <p>In an age where a new advance in reproductive technology occurs seemingly every month, pregnancy has come to be defined by such medical procedures as prenatal screening, amniocentesis, fetal monitoring, induced labor, and cesarean sections. Public policymakers, ethicists, religious figures, and the medical establishment control the debate, drowning out the voices of women who grapple in the most immediate sense with the issues. Even feminist theorists often overlook the nuances and paradoxes of the reproductive revolution as experienced by individual, particular women.<p> <p>The reader follows these thirty women as they speak about whether to become pregnant, and by what means; how to choose a health provider; what meaning they attribute to their pregnancies; and how they navigate their way through the contradictory pressures they face during pregnancy. The intimate nature of Gregg's research, consisting as it does largely of women's pregnancy narratives, lends her book a vibrancy often lacking in academic writing about reproduction. <p></p>",en,1st Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 0.69004688006 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches",22,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/51/9780814730751.jpg,Success,114,18.1

Edmund White, Andrew Holleran, Robert Ferro, Felice Picano, George Whitmore, Michael Grumley, and Christopher Cox - these are the writers whose novels, plays, short stories, and journalism defined what it was to be gay in that golden decade or so between the Stonewall Riots and the first announcements of AIDS. The Violet Quill Reader includes work never before published: stories, essays, and letters available nowhere else, as well as selections from Michael Grumley's and Felice Picano's journals and the correspondence of Robert Ferro and Andrew Holleran. There are also excerpts from their most important novels: A Boy's Own Story, Dancer from the Dance, Family of Max Desir, and Nebraska, among others. But The Violet Quill Reader is much more than a compendium of the first generation of post-Stonewall gay fiction. It is a portrait of the most exciting and tragic years of gay history, beginning in the heady possibilities of gay liberation, chronicling the roaring age of discos and Fire Island, and ending in the sober realities of AIDS. Award-winning author and scholar David Bergman helps readers survey this rich and exciting treasury of gay literature with his illuminating introduction and incisive notes.",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/26/9780312132026.jpg,Success,136,18.1

Many of the works here draw on the special experience of being a member of a minority group; all speak to the universal human condition. The contributors include such well-known names as Sandra Cisneros, Julia Alvarez, Denise Chavez, Ana Castillo, Cristina Garcia, and Sandra Benitez. Mexican Americans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and other women of the Americas are all represented. They write of their heritage; of their lives in an often alienating land; of the joys and sorrows of their particular communities; and of their political concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Sampling works from over 30 contemporary female Latin writers, this is a worthwhile and fashionable digest. The stories, recollections, letters and essays range widely in topic, tone, style and quality. Unfortunately, most of the strongest pieces are buried deep in the book. Among them, the story ``Personality Fabulosa'' by Monica Palacios captures with deceptive levity a heavy crush at the moment it develops into mutual courtship. Also terrific, Lucha Corpi's essay, ``Epiphany: The Third Gift'' depicts a tomboy distressing her traditional parents, who find solace in her bookishness: ""`When you educate a man,' my father would often tell my younger sister and me, `you educate an individual. But when you educate a woman, you educate the whole family.'"" Mary Helen Ponce's ``Just Dessert'' deftly portrays a disastrous dinner date, as the woman futilely tries to concentrate on the man's gorgeous lips and ignore the bigotry coming out of them. The stories of Cristina Garca, Aurora Levins Morales, Kathleen Ann Gonzlez and Judith Ortiz Cofer also work brilliantly. Less successfully, other writers rely too much on their ethnicity for interest rather than intrinsic merit. For example, Esmeralda Santiago's excerpt comes across as politically correct and facile: ``Americanos talk funny when they speak Spanish.'' By and large, however, the several gems in this collection outweigh the weak parts.

This Volume Presents Portraits Of Five Women Who Were Married To Husbands In The Same Professional Field As Their Own, While Also Helping The Reputations Of Their Spouses As Well As Achieving Their Own Personal And Professional Goals. The Five Biographies Focus On Women Who Have Achieved That Balance Between Family And Career. In The Cases Of Scientist Mileva Maric (albert Einstein's First Wife) And Artist Lee Krasner (painter Jackson Pollock's Wife), Both Women Sacrificed Time And Energy To Advance Their Husbands' Careers And Provide Harmonious Domestic Atmospheres (despite, In Krasner's Case, A Frequently Drunken And Abusive Partner). Although The Husbands Of Architect Denise Scott Brown And Nobel Prize-winning Physicist Maria Goeppert Mayer Encouraged Their Wives To Pursue Their Careers, The Women Were Hampered By The Sexism Rampant In Their Professions.

Juxtaposing autobiography and ethnography, Linden begins this study by situating herself in the context of her assimilated Jewish family, where the Holocaust was shrouded in silences. Urged forward by these silences, Linden, a feminist and sociologist, began to interview Jewish Holocaust survivors in 1983. As Linden interprets survivors' accounts of the death camps and the resistance, she reveals complex ways in which selves are constructed through storytelling. The stories that unfold are continuously fashioned and refashioned - never stripped of context or frozen in time. What emerges is an unexpectedly elegant montage in which interviewee, interviewer, and author are intertwined. Linden's meetings with survivors and her encounters with their stories transformed her as a feminist, a Jew, and a social scientist. Her analysis reveals the intimate connections between an ethnographer's lived experience and her interpretations of others'. Linden's reflections on the process of ethnography belie the rhetoric of positivism in the social sciences. They will inspire other scholars to break free of research and writing practices in their own disciplines that efface the ineluctable bond between knower and known. All readers will be challenged to reexamine the Holocaust in an intensely personal light and to reconsider the meanings of survival in our own time. Cutting across the boundaries of ethnography and autobiography to create a new kind of text, Making Stories, Making Selves offers a significant contribution to interpretive social science and the literature of the Holocaust. Linden's original and courageous work is vital reading for Holocaust scholars, students of modern Jewish life sociologists feminist theorists, and all readers seeking to understand their own relationship to the Holocaust.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.71 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/46/9780814205846.jpg,Success,115,18.1
