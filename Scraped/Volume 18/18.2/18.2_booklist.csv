Sex Surveyed focuses on the sex survey for a number of reasons: first, surveys have been extremely important in influencing popular opinion about sexual norms and conventions; second, this approach is crucial to ideas about science, generalisability and validity; third, developments in the form and status of the survey from the 1930s through the post-war period are complexly interwoven with the sex survey and are under-researched particularly from a feminist viewpoint. Section One examines the creation of Mass-Observation and the epistemological and methodological stance which led to the world's first national random sample survey of sex, as well as the major British sex surveys carried out from Mass-Observation's 1949 'Little Kinsey' through to the 1994 Wellcome 'National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles'. Section Two contains the full 'Little Kinsey' report, which many contemporary researchers allude to but which has not been published before now. Section Three discusses the structure and argument of 'Little Kinsey' and compares its approach with that of the feminist sex surveys carried out by Shere Hite through a detailed discussion of the Hite Reports. Illuminating reading for the general reader, essential reading for students on Sexuality, Methodology, Women's Studies and British Modern Social History courses, and a key text for all Sociologists.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches",59.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/84/9780748403684.jpg,Success,86,18.2

The first such organization in the country, this unit is charged with supervising every sex crimes prosecution in Manhattan. As a consequence Linda Fairstein and her associates have been at the very center of the massive changes in sex crimes law and procedure that have occurred over the past two decades. Emulated in most other major cities, New York's SCPU and its counterparts throughout the country have had extraordinary high success rates in prosecuting these violent crimes. Through their efforts, a victim of rape now can expect sensitive treatment from the police, can expect to be believed and supported, and has some reasonable expectation of winning in the courtroom. In Sexual Violence, Linda Fairstein shares the wisdom she has accumulated on the front lines in the war against rape, from her beginnings as a corporate law-bound female graduate of a prestigious law school to her job in the D.A.'s office at a time when criminal prosecution was ""no place for a woman."" Over the years, Linda Fairstein has personally tried or been involved in scores of nationally prominent rape cases, including the Robert Chambers Preppy Murder Trial and the case of the Central Park Jogger. She has been called upon to comment on virtually every significant sex crimes investigation in the country. Through the story of the Midtown Rapist case and other major investigations, she shows here how the system works to protect victims and punish criminals: how evidence is gathered, how witnesses are interviewed, how indictments are produced, and, finally, the nuts and bolts of trial, verdict, and sentencing. Sexual Violence is a living document of the transformation of our notion of sex crimes, an up-to-date commentary on the vital issues of stranger and date rape and the struggle to expunge the traditional stigma that has for too long been attached to victims of s

                        <p>For two decades, Linda Fairstein has waged war against rape. From directing Mahattan's Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit to her involvement in nationally prominent rape cases, this book offers the extraordinary story of the crimes, the trials, the convictions--and the massive changes within the legal processes that give new hope to sex crime victims today.

Magdalena Yoder, practical Mennonite proprietor of the determinedly quaint PennDutch Inn, has succeeded in converting a tranquil family farm into a thriving hostelry catering to sophisticated urbanites with a yen for charm and Amish ambience. With rooms in constant demand, Magdalena is usually able to select a compatible group of guests from her permanent waiting list. But a touchy situation develops when an arrogant congressman, his elegant wife, and an eager aide arrive for the start of deer hunting season, and a second contingent of customers turns out to be a curious assortment of animal rights activists. Then one strangely reclusive visitor is found dead, apparently as the result of a fall down Magdalena's quaintly steep staircase. Worried about lawsuits, infuriated by her wayward sister, attracted to one rough-edged reformed hunter, Magdalena does her best to mediate the conflicts between finicky vegetarian diners and a stubborn Amish cook, and to puzzle out the complex personal connections among her divergent group of visitors. With the kitchen a battleground between culinary lifestyles, Magdalena prevails upon her guests to cook the second night's dinner. The result is a farcical communal meal - and another death, this one no more an accident than the first turns out to have been. Everyone at the inn is under suspicion, including a most perplexed proprietor, whose stolid good nature won't stretch much farther.

                        <p>When a guest takes a fatal fall down the PennDutch Inn's quaintly steep stairs, Magdalena Yoder, the no-nonsense owner, is more worried about a lawsuit than foul play. But when a second guest is found dead on Magdalena's handsome quilt, she's sure there's a killer somewhere on the premises. This first book in a new series includes authentic Pennsylvania-Dutch recipes. Original.

This is the first time that a major American museum has considered this important subject in a broad cross-generational context.

Hip, computer literate, and chocoholic, Lauren Laurano breaks the P.I. stereotype. And her new case breaks records for perplexity. Boston Blackie hires Lauren to find out what really happened to his mother, who reportedly died almost forty years before. What appears to be simply a case of a hurt inner child and a cold trail turns into a complex exploration of the dark secrets that haunt families and small towns. Was Boston Blackie's mother murdered, as he believes? Or was the obituary describing her death in a car accident accurate? Or did she, as others claim, run off to Hollywood? After unearthing puzzles of identity and paternity, Lauren is left with an increasing number of questions but few answers. Pursuing a series of murky clues, she divides her time between upstate New York, where the missing woman's family and friends run her in circles, and the home she shares with her lover, Kip, in Greenwich Village, where a crew is intrusively filming a movie based on her adventures. Lauren knows she's getting close to the truth when the danger - and a new string of murders - hit her turf and threaten her life. The upshot is pulse-quickening excitement as Lauren's neighborhood know-how and resources kick into action. A murder mystery that delightfully spoofs a genre, My Sweet Untraceable You has the sense of humor and heart that Sandra Scoppettone's readers have come to love.                        <p>America's favorite lesbian detective returns.

Nelson DeMille and other advance readers have called it ""truly amazing,"" ""a classic"" with ""immense appeal"". It is all of that, and more: a stunning debut novel about a web of unsolved murders in New York's Gramercy Park and the singular woman who makes them her obsession. At its center is Kathleen Mallory, an extraordinary wild child turned New York City policewoman. Adopted off the streets as a little girl by a police inspector and his wife, she is still not altogether civilized now that she is a sergeant in the Special Crimes section. With her ferocious intelligence and green gunslinger eyes, Mallory (never Kathleen, never Kathy) operates by her own inner compass of right and wrong, a sense of justice that drives her in unpredictable ways. She is a thing apart. And today, she is a thing possessed. Although more at home in the company of computers than in the company of men, Mallory is propelled onto the street when the body of her adoptive father, Louis Markowitz, is found stabbed in a tenement next to the body of a wealthy Gramercy Park woman. The murders are clearly linked to two other Gramercy Park homicides Markowitz had been investigating, and now his cases become Mallory's, his death her cause. Prowling the streets, sifting through his clues, drawing on his circle of friends and colleagues, she plunges into a netherworld of light and shadow, where people are not what they seem and truth shifts without warning. And a murderer waits who is every bit as wild and unpredictable as she....

                        <p>Kathleen Mallory was saved from the streets of New York and taken in by a police sargeant when she was ten. Fifteen years later, she too is part of the NYPD and about to embark on the case of her life--finding her father's murderer.

Apprenticed to the outrageous Diana Vreeland, she put up with the temper tantrums and fits of pique and genius of some of the most sought-after creative minds of the era. She also saw everything she thought was wrong with fashion magazines: the distance from reality, the disinterest in real women and their lives, the disregard for money. When she succeeded Vreeland as Vogue's editor in chief in the 1970s, Mirabella redesigned and redefined the magazine. By the end of her seventeen-year term with Vogue, its readership had tripled. But in the 1980s, Grace was very publicly fired.

With sure authenticity, the author evokes the atmosphere of 1854, seven years before the Civil War, and brings to life the vivid cast of characters involved. A local election is pending, from which Glynis and Elizabeth Cady Stanton hope will come gains for women's rights. A wealthy resident has started Seneca Falls's first theater, and its production of Macbeth looms large in the story. Glynis herself faces a wrenching decision: Constable Cullen Stuart wants her as his wife when he moves west to become a Pinkerton man. Warm as her regard for Cullen may be, Glynis is reluctant, knowing how her life must change after marriage. Meanwhile, Seneca Falls has become an important stop on the Underground Railroad. Fugitive slaves following the North Star to Canada find support from many of the town's inhabitants, including Glynis. It is a difficult commitment at best, and when complicated by murder, a perilous one as well. Once again, Miriam Grace Monfredo has combined historical events, a moving personal story, and an engrossing mystery in a work of extraordinary interest.

                        <p>The year is 1854. In Seneca Falls, New York, everyone is busy with the opening of a new theater, no one notices the death of a freed slave. As a supporter of the Underground Railroad, Glynis hears information that raises her suspicions, and soon discovers more than she wants to know about some of the so-called sympathizers.

 From her childhood vacations at Sissinghurst, where her mentors, Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson, encouraged her first writings, to her successful career as a writer in New York and Charleston, Dawn Langley Simmons has experienced an extraordinary life of creativity, spent in the company of accomplished writers, actors and artists, including Dame Margaret Rutherford, who adopted her and was regarded by the author as her true ""mother.""<br>

0-385-47500-4,Joining the Tribe: Growing Up Gay and Lesbian in the '90s,"Due, Linnea",Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group,320,8/1/1995,,Paperback,"<p><P>As our country struggles to accept its gay and lesbian citizens, the debate for gay civil rights often focuses on the issue of choice, with the majority of Americans believing that to be gay is a choice, one that's embraced for its lifestyle. This belief ignores the presence and experience of one segment of the gay and lesbian population&#58; its youth. In <i>Joining The Tribe</i>, journalist Linnea Due travels America to create a portrait of gay and lesbian teenagers as an endangered and vulnerable community whose diversity, courage, and resiliency will inspire gay and straight readers alike. By vividly documenting the lives of gay and lesbian teenagers, Due shows that homosexuality is not about choice. It's about fights in the schoolyard, whispers in the locker room, cruel classmates, and oblivious or abusive parents. Most gay and lesbian youth endure severe humiliation and isolation for being gay, resulting in depression and low self-esteem for most, and suicide for some. Combining in-depth interviews with social analysis, Due reveals the realities gay and lesbian teenagers face, often without the support of family, peer groups, or adult gay and lesbian networks. With stories from across America, Due meets kids from a range of backgrounds and families, with some in the closet, some out, most somewhere-in-between, all struggling to grow into adulthood. By turns heartbreaking and infuriating, <i>Joining The Tribe</i> shows how against overwhelming odds, gay and lesbian teenagers continue to survive and bounce back, ready to join their brothers and sisters in gay America's fight for freedom and respect.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>If Due's (High and Outside) collection of poignant interviews with gay and lesbian youth reminds us of one thing, it is that greater visibility does not mean greater safety. Due (whose feature on gay and lesbian teenagers was declared one of the top six underreported stories of 1992 by Media Alliance/Project Censored) talked with lesbian, gay and bisexual adolescents of different ethnicities, classes and backgrounds across the U.S. They vividly recount the assaults they suffer in their families and schools and in the broader society, assaults including name-calling, beatings and death threats. Many testify eloquently to the fear, pain and shame that come not because of their sexual orientation per se, but because of the devastating results its disclosure had on many of their social relationships. At the same time, some speak touchingly of first love, of support from family and friends and of the efforts by some communities to provide services to gay and lesbian youth. Unlike many of the professional resources available for counselors, teachers and others concerned about these teens, Due lets her interviewees speak for themselves, while her sensitive editing provides background, commentary and balance between individual and collective experience. The result is a moving, vital pastiche. (Sept.)</p>",en,1st Anchor Bks Ed.

In many ways, gay and lesbian humor is no different from heterosexual comedy, but the material does raise a few eyebrows: the insufferable Jesse Helms, the military ban (""be all you can be ...but in private""), living up to the Lesbian Chic, the trauma of gay male dating rituals, body piercing (""sometimes a fashion statement is a cry for help""), coming out to parents (""Mom, would you please pass the potatoes to a homosexual""), and so much more. By rejecting stereotypes and playing with differences, gay and lesbian humor not only entertains, but educates by disarming ignorancc and fear and the homophobia they engender.&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, a portion of all proceeds from this book will be donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, the organization that, among other projects, initiated and promoted the ""red ribbon"" campaign for AIDS awareness.

As both child and adult, Blanca was abused by both people and the economic system the creates the meanest, most violent ghettoes. In Bianca, Ambert explores how oppression breeds violence and entraps people, even after they escape poverty and become successful. Once Bianca breaks out of the ghetto, she is not free; there is a severe emotional price to pay. She suffers the pain of living between two cultures, two languages, two ways of perceiving the world; she is caught in the emotional limbo of a dual identity.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Poet and short-story writer Ambert's first novel chronicles the harrowing tale of a young woman pulled unwillingly through life in New York's South Bronx. Blanca battles poverty, abuse and despair, but her toughest confrontation is with her own memories. ``The memory is not clear, but reeks of an atavistic sadness, passive for centuries,'' she muses. ``Atavistic sadness'' might suggest the novel is a statement on the Puerto Rican people, in which case it might have resonated. But the events of one young woman's life are doled out relentlessly to the reader like so many strikes of a hammer. The novel begins with Blanca's most recent suicide attempt-her way of fighting the persistent oppression of recollection. Yet, although the story is written partly in the first person and recounts many of Blanca's abysmal experiences, it circles around reflection without defining the core of the problem. One feels that the author is trying hard but unsuccessfully to expose a devastating truth in these pages, but the suffocating atmosphere of this relentlessly depressing story traps the reader inside Blanca's ``dark pain'' without catharsis or surcease.

This is the black Midwest of the 1950s, when towns could count their white folks on one hand - the years before the civil rights movement came along and changed everything. In perfectly cadenced vernacular, Maxine Clair speaks to us through the voices of Rattlebone's citizens: October Brown, the new schoolteacher with a camel's walk and shoulder-padded, to-the-nines dresses; Irene Wilson, naive and wise, who must grapple with her parent's failing marriage as she steps eagerly into adulthood; and Thomas Pemberton, owner of the local rooming house, an old man with a young heart. Sparkling with lyricism, Clair's interconnected stories celebrate the natural beauty of the Midwest and the dignity and vitality of these most ordinary lives.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Clair's debut short-story collection, 11 interlocked tales set in an African American outskirt of Kansas City, Kans., in the 1950s, launches her toward the front ranks of contemporary fiction. Of the several narrative voices, both first- and third-person, that tell of life in Rattlebone, Irene ``Reenie'' Wilson's occupies the passionate center, with well over half the stories related in her words, which evolve from a convincing childspeak vernacular to an engrossingly poetic prose that follows her coming-of-age amid the breakings and reshapings of her family and community, as well as of the unknown world around her. The opening story details the eight-year-old Reenie's experiences stemming from the first day of the school year. Awed by the new teacher, October Brown, and by local lore about the white mark (``a Devil's kiss'') on October's face, Reenie's fear turns to adoration and then to hate as she realizes the destruction that the woman has wrought upon the Wilson family. From the girl's suspicions about the spiritual ambitions of an itinerant white nun through various friendships and alliances, the accidental death of her first crush, her own near-death experience and, finally, her high school graduation, Reenie's lofty childhood motto, ``I am in this world, but not of it,'' aptly describes the inspired insight and strength that she comes to wield. Interspersed among Reenie's chronicle are equally intense stories about her father, James; rooming-house owners Thomas and Lydia Pemberton; Irene's mother, Pearlean; and the growing up of Irene's neighbor, playmate and competitor, Wanda. These and Reenie's own tales add up to an utterly addictive collection by a writer to watch.

It is the first in a series about Mary Greyfeather, a contemporary Native American girl whose world bridges two distinct cultures, that of the traditional Shawnee and that of a typical American child.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>First-time author Watkins, who is of Shawnee and Cherokee heritage, pens a sympathetic if wordy story that boasts a rarity for books about Native American culture: a realistic, contemporary setting. Four-year-old Mary's grandmother decides it's high time that the child receives her Shawnee name, and the task of selecting just the right one is entrusted to the elder women of the family. They focus on the horse-name group--helpful, hard-working, beautiful horses, the reader learns, were an important part of Shawnee culture--and choose Wapapiyeshe (it means ``white-necked, moving''). But when relatives gather for the ceremony, Mary's aunt Laura, who was supposed to bring the white bead necklace traditionally given to a girl at her naming, has car trouble and can't come. Grandma Greyfeather saves the day with a necklace made of white buttons from the sewing basket and the celebration begins. The book provides a welcome glimpse at how tribal traditions are woven into the fabric of modern-day life; its educational value is enhanced by the inclusion of Shawnee vocabulary cut-out ``flashcards'' and a thumbnail-sketch history of the Shawnee people. But it never entirely rises above the double handicap of an overlong text and pedestrian illustrations. Ages 5-8.
