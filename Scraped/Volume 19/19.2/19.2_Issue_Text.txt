Feminist Family Values Forum
Order now for delivery mid-September 1996
On May 10,1996 the Foundation for a Compassionate Society invited
these women to speak on family values from a feminist point of view.
A common thread in the presentations was that social change is
necessary in order to allow all humans to thrive. Let's begin, as this
year's presidential campaigns gear up, to spark public discussion
about values beyond right wing definitions of family.
Produced by Plain View Press in collaboration with the Foundation for a Compassionate
Society, the book will be available in September, 1996. A 50% discount will be given to
bookstores that order directly from: the Foundation for a Compassionate Society: 1711

° WHY DID THE MISCARRIAGE OCCUR?
° WHAT HAPPENS HORMONALLY AFTER MISCARRIAGE?
° HOW CAN ONE COMMUNICATE WITH LOVED ONES AND
ACQUAINTANCES ABOUT THE FEELINGS AFTER MISCARRIAGE?
° WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO TRY AGAIN?
° WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE’S A SECOND MISCARRIAGE?
A Woman Doctor's Guide to Miscarriage also includes up-to-date informa-
tion on recent medical breakthroughs and personal testimonies from
women who have suffered miscarriages themselves—making it an
indispensable source for helping women free themselves from misin-

to booksellers in many mainstream press booths. One
publisher, when queried about the effects of the re-
duced bookseller attendance, responded, “Yes, but
we're selling rights,” consciously or unconsciously
echoing an informal theme of the show, “Yes, but who
needs booksellers?”
When questioned at the “Town Meeting” about
the apparent low attendance of booksellers and their
plans to resolve this problem, ABA officials cited the
loss of 200 member stores (presumably to chains) and
that 19 stores had closed in Chicago since last ABA. The
assumption seemed to be that next year, when the new
convention hall is finished, booksellers will again flock
to ABA and exhibitors will again provide deep staffing
for their booths. But, I have to admit, the logic escapes me.

this situation is complicated by the fact that the ABA
Convention is a workplace for thousands of women
exhibitors and booksellers. U.S. courts have pretty
consistently stated that beaver-shots and “girlie”
posters in the workplace create a hostile work
environment.
This kind of imagery has not been a problem for
several years, and it was surprising to see ABA unpre-
pared to take appropriate action on either the grounds
of racism or sexism. ABA, as an institution, seemed to
be much more conversant with the state of sexual
harassment legislation as applied to the convention
workplace a decade ago than it was at this convention.
ABA, apparently, needs to spend some time reviewing
sexual harassment laws and court decisions and needs
to convey appropriate standards to all exhibitors
before it allows another situation where ABA could be
liable for sexual harassment-related charges.

and Publishers Weekly have declined to run an ad that

Anti-Abortion Propaganda
There are certain complications that come from
selling your display space — including that customers
hold you accountable for the values espoused in those
(sold) spaces.
This year ABA sold the official “show bag”
(racks of which are placed at each entry, free for the
taking) to a publisher called Life Dynamics Incorpo-
rated. (Estimated price $7,500.) It was a rather ugly,
badly designed, green-on-black bag that read “Lime
5.” Thousands of people carried them around the
show only to find out later that the bag was a promo
piece for an anti-abortion tract with the same title.
The bag included promo material for the book and a

Suggestions from booksellers were, generally,
met with explanations as to the history of the prob-
lem and explanation of why it couldn’t be readily
solved, or, worse, impractical solutions. Regarding
double-shipments of books, the suggestion was to
refuse the shipment. This only works if the book-
seller knows it’s a double shipment before
unpacking it — as if the box is marked “double
shipment — you don’t want these books” on the
outside. The hope is that the situation that led to
double shipments has been resolved and won’t recur
— but some stores are still stuck holding the bag for
return shipments.
Goodwill and frustration aside, the situation
seems to be that these problems will be fixed as soon
as possible, and that there's not much booksellers can
do except wait it out or order books elsewhere in the
meantime if they need faster turnaround or if they
need to cascade orders.

Brooke (Lammas/DC) and River Artz (Pandora /Kala-
mazoo, MI), with site organizing by Ann
Christophersen (Women & Children First/Chicago).
Attendance at this year’s meetings reflected
ABA's low bookseller registration, and was only
about 60% of last year’s attendance, although about
10% of the participants flew in for the FB-Net Confer-
ence and didn’t attend ABA at all. Moving the site of
the FB-Net Conference was seriously considered for
the first time in several years. (See “Future FB-Net
Conference Sites,” below.)
Discussions and Workshops
Workshops included “Rapid Response” (the art
of being fluid and flexible in the rapidly changing
bookselling environment); using the internet, build-
ing Web pages and why; competition, cooperation
and inclusion as Web practices; fundraising; selling
used books; more ways to use the FB-Net catalog; and
a “Missions, Visions and Goals” workshop, presented
by Donna Paz (Paz & Associates).
And, of course, a number of other topics were
discussed along the way. It would be too difficult to
discuss “rapid responses” without talking strategies
for staying current with returns —and we didn’t even
try. Cost of goods was a hot topic, with discussions

ABA's schedule and location were readily

of losing our collective visibility at ABA, the

AUSTEN’S PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
Marcia McClintock Folsom, ed.
In sixteen essays, teachers of Jane Austen's best-known work discuss social history; Austen's biography;
her unpublished writings and her reading; and the novel's structure, themes, and language. Teachers will
especially appreciate the variety of information gathered in this volume: a chart of British social structure
that allows students to identify the classes of individual characters, a discussion of how teachers and students
might use Austen's juvenilia and letters to study the novel, the illumination of Austen's debt to Samuel
Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison, and many other ideas for the classroom. The collection also represents
a spectrum of opinions (e.g., on whether Austen is a “feminist”) that will help focus class discussions.

BRONTE’S JANÉ EYRE
Diane Long Hoeveler and Beth Lau, eds.
This collection includes twenty essays that will help bring new dimensions to classroom instruction on
Charlotte Brontë’s most taught work. Contributors discuss Brontë's milieu and biography; the influence of
Christianity, fairy tales, and Gothic fiction on her work; the themes of the novel and its social and political
implications; its film and stage adaptations; relevant artworks (paintings, etchings, and portraits); and various
theoretical approaches to teaching the book (e.g., psychological, Kristevan, Foucauldian, new-historicist).

ABA:
By Midge Stocker
Third Side Press has exhibited at ABA four
times in its five-year history, twice in the
Gay/Lesbian & Feminist aisle (“the Aisle”) and
twice in the Small Press section. Many booksell-
ers have asked us why we're in the Small Press
section, so I want to share my reasoning with
FBN readers. There are three basic answers.
The first answer, in these times of financial
duress for all of us, is money. A small press
booth for the 1997 ABA costs $624 total, includ-
ing carpet, a draped table, two chairs and a
wastebasket. A regular booth on the main floor
(on “the Aisle,” with a distributor, or elsewhere)
costs $2350 for the space. With rental of carpet, ®
tables and chairs, the cost jumps to around
$3000 for a booth with a minimal furniture setup. That
$2376 difference is about half the cost of a print run for
one of our regular books. Many general independent bookstores have or are
