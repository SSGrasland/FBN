Looking for respite in London after a stupefying visit from relatives, Mary encounters a friend from Oxford. The young woman introduces Mary to her current enthusiasm, a strange and enigmatic woman named Margery Childe, who leads something called ""The New Temple of God."" It seems to be a charismatic sect involved in the post-World War I suffrage movement, with a feminist slant on Christianity. Mary is curious about the woman, and intrigued. Is the New Temple a front for something more sinister? When a series of murders claims members of the movement's wealthy young female volunteers and principal contributors, Mary, with Holmes in the background, begins to investigate. Things become more desperate than either of them expected as Mary's search plunges her into the worst danger she has yet faced.

                        <p>The eagerly awaited sequel to The Beekeeper's Apprentice. Bored with family celebrations, Mary Russell follows Sherlock Holmes to London, meets a former Oxford classmate who is doing good work for a charismatic woman--a quasi-religious leader, quasi-early feminist--and becomes involved in some mysterious doings behind the spiritual scenes.

In addition to such seasonal delights, Living It Up offers resourceful everyday activities and crafts, like making bathmats and coasters from the hair that collects in the tub drain, and how to throw the perfect divorce party.

In fact, the rate of substance addiction rises from one in ten in the general community to perhaps as many as one in three in the gay community. 
<p><i>Accepting Ourselves,</i> first published in 1989, was the first book to address the problems and needs of substance abusers in the homosexual community. Now, in this fully revised and expanded second edition which includes a workbook format, <i>Accepting Ourselves and Others</i> examines the issue of recovery as it affects the homosexual and bisexual communities of the nineties, as well as their friends, family, and therapists. The authors address the relationship between substance abuse and being a sexual minority both within and outside of traditional Twelve Step models. They also offer new research on the relationship of HIV and AIDS to substance abuse in the gay community, as well as the relationship to other issues such as anxiety, depression, sexual abuse, and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>A special section developed for therapists assists the professional in working with gay clients suffering from addictive/compulsive behavior by addressing the impact issues such as abstinence, relapse, homophobia, and the prevailing denial of the magnitude compulsive behaviors have on this community. The Kominars offer a road map to those in the gay community searching to understand themselves and their addictive/compulsive behavior, providing invaluable help in maintaining long-term recovery.</p>
<p>This book is the first full, in-depth exploration of recovery for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, and for counselors, therapists, clinicians, and clergy who work with them. <i>Accepting Ourselves and Others</i> is a dynamic, frank primer that gets right at the heart of issues that recovering gay, lesbian, and bisexual people face.</p>

In the tradition of Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem, Roiphe blends autobiography and cultural criticism to give us a vivid portrait of the sexual puritanism sweeping the nation. She also captures the shadowy sense of unease that lies behind a generation's search for safety and rules, and the national yearning for a new moral order to replace the social and religious structures we have lost. Here for the first time is the history, personal and cultural, of the most profound shift in our national life in the last three decades: the movement from a wild-eyed ethos of sexual freedom to the new conservative morality of the nineties. In prose as absorbing as a novel, Roiphe gives us the inner landscape of a generation that remembers where it was on the day Magic Johnson announced he was HIV positive the way previous generations recall the day JFK was shot. We meet right-wing prophets of sexual abstinence in Washington, D.C., and public high school students and their teachers in suburban New Jersey. We enter the world of Alison Gertz, the Park Avenue debutante, and Magic Johnson, the ebullient point guard for the Lakers who boasted of satisfying six women at once, whose stories have imprinted themselves on the national imagination as moral parables for the uncertain and often terrifying age in which we live now.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.77 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches",26.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/92/9780316754392.jpg,Success,123,19.4

In Fisher’s writings the razor-sharp rage is equalled only by the enveloping sweetness; the raw eroticism by a dazzling writerly elegance. Evocations of a haunting and mobile childhood are mixed in Fisher’s stories with an X-ray view of the racialized sexual vernaculars of gay San Francisco; while the journals braid together the narratives of sexual exploration and discovery, a joyous and deepening vocation as a writer, a growing intimacy with death, and an engagement with racial problematics that becomes ever more gravely and probingly imaginative.<br>
A uniquely intimate, unflinching testimony of the experience of a young, African American gay man in the AIDS emergency, <i>Gary in Your Pocket</i> includes an introduction by Don Belton that describes Fisher’s achievement in the context of other work by Black gay men such as Marlon Riggs and Essex Hemphill, and a biographical afterword by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches",24.65,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/99/9780822317999.jpg,Success,83,19.4

A wilderness is roadless, both by agreement and by law. Surely this should also mean trailless, signless, mapless, nameless: no trace of human writing on the land, nothing to say that we have inscribed this place as ours. An absence that signals the purity of the land, an absence at the center of our desire. Maybe we should go to the wilderness to get lost, to lose the familiar way of cities and towns, to let loose of our everyday sense of our place, and find another way of being in the world. Lost, amazed, I might forget myself and find myself, a creature among other creatures, a reed in the wind, fed by sunlight, dead plants and animals, minerals from the mountains crumbling at my feet."" --<b>SueEllen Campbell</b>, from Bringing the Mountain Home A deeply loved landscape holds us fast to the planet, says SueEllen Campbell in this engaging exploration of our relationships with wild places. What lies at the core of such love? What draws us to a windblown mountaintop, the slickrock desert, the crash and roar of a whitewater river? What desires shape our wilderness journeys--backpacking, rafting, hiking--and what events, emotions, and ideas shape the stories we tell about them? Campbell explores these questions through personal narratives that float between memoir and meditation, nature essay and adventure story. She travels to a remote spot in Kenya, where thousands of flamingos ""encircle the geysers and carpet the glassy lake. In therain forests of Dominica, she marvels at parrots as bits of green forest tipped with scarlet and given wing. But always she returns to the intimate landscapes of her home in the Rocky Mountain and desert West. There, a trudge into the Grand Canyon becomes a pilgrimage into the earth’s immensity. Layers of personal grubbiness offer an introduction to geology, and a comical obsession with equipment hints at how to live in the moment. A climb up a familiar mountain turns into a brush with death. By turns celebratory, funny, lyrical, and down-to-earth, Campbell’s is an exuberant new voice that will appeal to many readers.

Kent Anderson Leslie uses the events of Dickson's life to explore the forces driving southern race and gender relations from the days of King Cotton through the Civil War, Reconstruction, and New South eras.<p>Although legally a slave herself well into her adolescence, Dickson was much favored by her father and lived comfortably in his house, receiving a genteel upbringing and education. After her father died in 1885 Dickson inherited most of his half-million dollar estate, sparking off two years of legal battles with white relatives. When the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the will, Dickson became the largest landowner in Hancock County, Georgia, and the wealthiest black woman in the post-Civil War South.<p>Kent Anderson Leslie's portrayal of Dickson is enhanced by a wealth of details about plantation life; the elaborate codes of behavior for men and women, blacks and whites in the South; and the equally complicated circumstances under which racial transgressions were sometimes ignored, tolerated, or even accepted.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Amanda was the daughter of a 13-year-old Georgia slave who was raped by David Dickson, the white plantation owner in whose household she worked. Although legally a slave until 1864, Amanda was raised in luxury by Dickson and his mother. Leslie's outstanding scholarly detective work illuminates issues of race and class in the life of a woman who escaped the limits of both. After her marriage to a white man failed, Amanda returned with her two children to live with Dickson until his death in 1885. He bequeathed most of his fortune to her, angering his white relations, who contested the will. Despite the legal and social sanctions against interracial families in the post-Civil War South, the court upheld Dickson's will. Leslie, assistant professor of women's studies at Oglethorpe University, relates that Amanda purchased a luxurious home in Augusta and, before her death, was married briefly to Nathan Toomer, father of African American writer Jean Toomer.

These women defied the military dictatorship by embroidering their sorrow on scraps of cloth and using their needles and thread as one of the boldest means of popular protest and resistance in Latin America. The arpilleras they made - patch-work tapestries with scenes of everyday life and memorials to their disappeared relatives - were smuggled out of Chile and brought to the world the story of their fruitless searches in jails, morgues, government offices, and the tribunals of law for their husbands, brothers, and sons. Marjorie Agosin, herself a native of and exile from Chile, has spent over twenty years interviewing the arpilleristas and following their work. She knows their stories intimately and knows, too, that not one of them has ever found a disappeared relative alive. Still, many of them maintain hope and continue to make their arpilleras. Even though the dictatorship ended in 1989 and democracy returned to Chile, no full account of the detained and disappeared has ever been offered. This book includes a history of the women's movement, testimonies from the women in their own words, and, for the first time, full color plates of their beautiful, moving, and ultimately hopeful arpilleras. Anyone interested in the history of contemporary Latin America will want to read this powerful story.

                        <p>""Arpilleras are burlap-backed tapestries depicting the experiences and emotions of women whose sons and husbands were arrested and never heard from again during the years of military rule. Agosin's narrative traces the arpillera movement from its early days under the promotion and protection of the Catholic Church's Vicarâia de Solidaridad through the early 1990s, when newly reestablished civilian authorities decided not to more forcefully seek justice for victims of human rights abuses. The book includes 45 reproductions (on glossy plates), and the moving testimonies of a number of the arpilleristas themselves""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57.

In The Masculine Marine, author Steven Zeeland records, for the first time ever, what active-duty Marines have to say about what it means to be a man, to be a Marine, and to desire other men.</p>
<p>As the foremost surviving icon of traditional masculinity, Marines are often considered the opposite of “gay.” Yet in contemporary gay culture, Marines are stereotyped as likely to play the passive role in sexual encounters with other men. By vividly illustrating some of the startling ways in which gay and Marine attributes can coincide, The Masculine Marine uncovers the wild sexual contradictions built into military hypermasculinity.</p>
<p>From ordinary grunts to a major who flies a combat jet, Zeeland’s Marine interviewees provide thoughtful and articulate insight into aspects of this rarely documented culture, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>homoerotic bonding among Marines</li>
<li>how gay Marines reconcile their sexual identity with the ethos of “hard” Marine supermasculinity</li>
<li>how some Marines eroticize the pain and humiliation of Marine Corps boot camp</li>
<li>Marines in all-male pornography</li>
<li>male attitudes toward women in the Marine Corps</li>
<li>hazing and institutional violence 
<p>These Marines talk candidly about what motivated them to join the United States’most elite fighting force, and they reveal how becoming Marines has shaped their sexual and gender identities. For the student of gay or military studies or anyone sexually intrigued by men in uniform, The Masculine Marine must reading.</p>

But all the native animals communicate by telepathy, projecting images that drive humans mad. Only Nighthorses stand between civilization and madness. When a flare of human emotion spreads to all the horses, chaos erupts.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this perceptive and carefully crafted coming-of-age novel, humans share a remote and arduous world with telepathic fauna who communicate their instincts and desires to receptive colonists. Chief among the beasts that seek out companionship with humans are the nighthorses, who enter into a near-symbiotic relationship with their chosen partners, who become the riders and protectors of the world's isolated villages and the convoys needed to supply them. When Guil Stuart's lover, Aby Dale, is killed while guarding one such convoy, the rider sets out in a frenzy with his nighthorse, Burn, to avenge her death. While townsfolk urge that he be killed, three ostensible friends set out to find and help him, accompanied by novice rider Danny Fisher. A town boy sought out by the nighthorse Cloud, Danny was raised to fear and to hate communion with the beasts, which were reviled by the preachers, and was guided in his adjustment to rider life by the older, rider-bred Stuart. Also following Stuart into the wild is Ancel Harper, an old enemy with an obscure and dangerous grudge. Cherryh never overwhelms the narrative with exposition, skillfully unfolding her society of humans and aliens so that the reader gradually understands past events and present situations.

It is an exercise in sanity, an affirmation of life and community composed of the drawings and writings of women in Belgrade refugee camps. The I Remember project (Sjecam Se in Serbo-Croatian) was conceived by two women refugees who were working with Women in Black in Belgrade and was made possible by financial and moral support from women in Italy and Spain. Its purpose was to encourage and give hope to other women refugees - to challenge them to draw on their humanity as a resource against the despair caused by a war they never wanted. The memories these women chose to draw and write down range from mundane to extraordinary, lyrical to bitter. But running through the thirty-two memoirs is a common theme of bewilderment, not only about personal predicament, but about the lack of an understandable reason behind it. One of the worst tragedies of one of the most destructive wars of the late 20th century is that it came from the will of a few power-grabbing leaders - men who found that in unstable times they could play on nationalist sentiment, whipped up by lies in the media, to make people accept war over diversity and accommodation. I Remember, in which ordinary women reconstruct in words and pictures communities now torn apart by such rhetoric, offers a powerful testament to the brutality of nationalist drives toward sameness and purity. And, amidst outsiders' attempts to explain the war in terms of the history of old hatreds, I Remember will stand as a poignant record of courage and the desire to live in peaceful and culturally complex community - written by those women who lost the most.",en,First Edition,"Height: 6.6 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.99 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",21.6,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/66/9781879960466.jpg,Success,94,19.4

For the colorful Lady Imogen kept diaries documenting her passionate affair with a rising young politician who has since risen to high ranks in the government. Increasingly eccentric as the years have passed, Lady Imogen now threatens to reveal details of the affair, and of the subsequent and unsolved disappearance of a young journalist. Jemima's meeting with Lady Imogen is the first step in a sinister series of events which will remind the reader why Antonia Fraser is the reigning queen of murder&#151;British style!</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Lady Imogen Swain, once a Cecil Beaton beauty, now annoys Harrod's employees by trying to return 30-year-old ball gowns in this highly civilized, unexpectedly tepid tale of political doings in Britain. During a particularly nasty general election campaign, Lady Imogen decides to tell the world what she knows about the infamous Faber Mystery, a political scandal as old as her wardrobe. She invites Jemina Shore, TV's consummately professional investigative journalist, to her dilapidated townhouse to reveal what happened to Franklyn Faber, who vanished without a trace in the middle of his 1964 trial for selling state secrets. Could his fate, which has baffled the nation for decades, be described in one of the diaries Lady Imogen presses into her hands? Initially inclined to think not, Shore changes her mind later that evening when, after reading a few passages, it becomes clear that Lady Imogen, as former mistress to one of the players in the scandal who is currently up for reelection, does indeed know whereof she speaks. Unfortunately, the answer rests in one of the other diaries, which goes missing after Lady Imogen falls to her death that same night from her rickety balcony. Her disaffected daughters and her former lover's children are among the suspects in an intelligent tale that is filled with atmosphere but whose characters seem a bit remote.

In a famous Gilchrist story she dressed as a nun and robbed a bar in New Orleans. Now, happily married and the mother of twins, Nora Jane returns to college and finds herself faced with a series of disasters that threaten her blissful life: a chance encounter between her husband and an old boyfriend, who fathered one of the twins; the assassination of a visiting writer; and a camping trip that nearly proves fatal. The resolution of these complications, aided by a mysterious visit from Leonardo da Vinci, culminates in the adaptation of two waifs, the marriage of an old friend, and the introduction of two new families into Gilchrist's galaxy of characters. The nine stories that follow, collectivity entitled Past, explore the hazards of recapturing and reviving old affairs. Using new and familiar characters, these stories shed new light on the oldest and most powerful emotion.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The novella that occupies more than half of this satisfying volume displays many of Gilchrist's characteristics: the reappearance of characters encountered in previous works; frequent foreshadowing and flashbacks; a mix of the mundane and the miraculous; and copious literary and scientific referencesall employed in the service of an eventful story. Nora Jane and Company reprises the eponymous character whom we last saw giving birth to twins, in Light Can Be Both Wave and Particle. Here, the twins are now 10; Nora Jane is 29 and happily married to Freddy Harwood. As usual, all the players in a sizable cast of characters are larger than life: they live spontaneously, even recklessly; they have lots of money and spend it freely and frivolously; they are ruled by passionate emotions fueled by brilliant insights and sudden visions. In the course of the novella, Nora Jane, Freddy and the twins' godfather, journalist and film critic Neiman Gluuk, experience a terrorist assassination of one of their friends; enroll at Berkeley for graduate studies; survive an emergency in the California wilderness; and participate in a minor miracle that employs the long arm of coincidence and a cloak worn by the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci. Gilchrist's matter-of-fact prose carries a gloss of melodrama, and her characters are given to pontificating (about such matters as the fatwa against Salman Rushdie), didactic speeches (about the makeup of the universe, etc.) and outlandish behavior. Nine additional stories make up the second section. One of them centers on Nora Jane as a very special, charismatic child (Gilchrist is particularly good with children's and teenagers' dialogue), and all are imbued with wry humor, nostalgia for lost innocence and gratitude for the power of memory to enrich life. Gilchrist's hand is sure, her vision keen and sometimes antic, and the world she has created in 12 previous books is expanded and enhanced by these luminous tales.

Born in Guadeloupe in 1937, CondÃ© lived in Guinea after it won its independence from France. Later she lived in Ghana and Senegal during turbulent, decisive moments in the histories of these countries. Her writings-novels, plays, essays, stories, and children's books-have led her to an increasingly important role within Africa and throughout the world. FranÃ§oise Pfaff met Maryse CondÃ© in 1981, when she first interviewed her. Their friendship grew quickly. In 1991 the two women continued recording conversations about CondÃ©'s geographical sojourns and literary paths, her personality, and her thoughts. Their conversations reveal connections between CondÃ©'s vivid art and her eventful, passionate life. In her encounters with historical and literary figures, and in her opinions on politics and culture, CondÃ© appears as an engaging witness to her time. The conversations frequently sparkle with humor; at other moments they are infused with profound seriousness. Maryse CondÃ© is the recipient of the French literary awards Le Grand Prix LittÃ©raire de la Femme and Le Prix de l'AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise. She currently teaches at Columbia University and her most recent works include Tree of Life and Crossing the Mangrove.

Regardless Of Hiv Status, All Are Called On To Maintain Vigilant Safety With Sex, To Face Down A Cultural Stigma Greater Even Than Homophobia, And To Somehow Find A Way To Go Forward In A World Heavy With Loss. At Long Last, Current Medical Breakthroughs Offer The Hope Of Changing The Face Of The Epidemic, But The Psychological Crisis Continues. New Infections Are On The Rise Among Young Gay Men. Exhaustion And Grief Threaten To Overwhelm The Activism And Optimism Of Earlier Years. In A World Turned Upside Down, The Challenge Of Finding Meaning Is More Than An Idle Philosophical Exercise. It Is A Matter Of Psychological And Perhaps Even Physical Survival. Dr. Steven Schwartzberg Grounds His Insights In His Own Experiences As A Gay Man And As A Practicing Psychotherapist, And In In-depth Interviews With Nineteen Men Living With Hiv. Ranging In Age From Twenty-seven To Fifty, The Men Include A Construction Foreman, A Physician, An Art Historian, A Waiter, A Librarian, And A Licensed Massage Therapist. With Candor, Insight, Eagerness, And A Remarkable Ability To Share Of Themselves, They Speak Eloquently About How Hiv Has Affected Their Views Of The World, Their Senses Of Themselves, And How They Live Their Lives. Interweaving The Men's Stories With Observations From His Research And Clinical Practice, Schwartzberg Bears Witness To The Remarkable Transformations Some Men Have Accomplished, And The Anguish Of Meaninglessness That Weighs Others Down. He Strives To Uncover Why Some View Hiv As A Catalyst For Change Or Growth, While Others See It Only As Punishment. And Though He Passes No Judgment On The Coping Strategies He Describes, Schwartzberg Does Insist On The Vital Necessity Of Balancing Somber Reality With Healing, Life-sustaining Hope. He Argues That Men Who Opt For Too Much Illusion And Too Little Reality Risk Shoddy Self-care And Inadequate Preparation For The Future, While Those Who Find No Escape From Reality May Teeter Into Rage Or Suicidal Despair.--jacket. 1.

The views of politicians, the public, and the clergy have received much media attention, often overshadowing those of the parents themselves. Fiona Nelson attempts to bridge this gap with Lesbian Motherhood, the first study of its kind, which explores the many aspects and stages of lesbian motherhood. Nelson's study is based on over thirty interviews with lesbian mothers in Alberta. The women fall into two groups: those raising children who had been conceived in prior heterosexual relationships and those raising children who had been conceived within lesbian relationships. The two groups provide a valuable comparison because, although the effects of the social context can be quite similar for each, their experiences of mothering are often strikingly different. Nelson explores such topics as reproductive decision-making, interacting with other mothers, the effects of the social context in which lesbian mothering is occurring, step-parenting, domestic and parenting roles, and raising boys. The non-supportive social milieu in which they exist is one of the major factors distinguishing lesbian families from many other families. There is some discussion in the book of the political activism that has occurred in Canada around the legal status and equality of lesbian women and their families. There is also a Canadian resource directory for lesbian mothers and prospective mothers.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.52470018356 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",9.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/54/9780802071354.jpg,Success,118,19.4

A leading professor of psychology at Harvard University, Roger Brown bravely comes forth with his compelling story of grief, loneliness, and a relentless search for intimacy, healing, and self-acceptance. Readers gain insight into a stage of life experienced by gay men of which little is written or spoken due to the ageism that characterizes homosexual culture.</p>
<p>Against My Better Judgment reveals deeply personal truths that will prepare gay men for what to expect in the later stages of life. Universal in nature, these truths will speak to readers from various lifestyles and of all ages. Readers will recognize the book as a story of looking for love in all the wrong places, but will also see in it a process of discovery—both internal and external.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of his lover’s death, Brown turns to prostitutes for companionship, for relieving repressed sexual energy, and even for love. Through his unique relationships with three young men, he does not find the romantic love he so desperately seeks, but discovers that his idea of human nature has been formed by his particular life position and association with people who share his values, knowledge, and privileges. Once he goes outside his social and intellectual circle, he acquires a new perspective on life and realizes how far from universal truth his notions of humanity have been.</p>
<p>Readers of Against My Better Judgment will gain a different perspective on the complexities of love, relationships, fidelity, human nature, and the hardships of life inevitably faced by all humans—straight, gay, or bisexual. Gay men, lesbians, psychologists, widowers, therapists, and anthropologists, as well as sensitive readers of any background, will heighten their understanding of what it means to be human. This remarkable story makes a tremendous contribution to existing gay literature and the timeless struggle of art and literature to make sense of the universe and the place of humans within it. Echoing life, Against My Better Judgment, with its brutal honesty, intrigues and repels alternately, just as it elicits both sadness and laughter.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.35 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",47.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/81/9781560238881.jpg,Success,87,19.4

Isherwood writes in defense of the industry, and as a partial response to the accusations traces Stefano's life through a stereotypically troubled upbringing in Pennsylvania that culminated in his sporadically successful careers in dancing, prostitution and Los Angeles's pornographic film industry. This last achievement was unheard of at the time, specifically because the young superstar was a ""bottom""-defined by the author as ""the passive performer in anal sex, the active one in oral""-and it was believed that gay audiences preferred ""tops,"" or more ""masculine"" performers. Stefano's career peaked when he won the Best Actor AVN, the industry's equivalent to the Oscar, for his performance in More of a Man, but then his popularity faded. Coupled with this was his knowledge that he was HIV positive, and Stefano increasingly numbed himself with a variety of drugs including Ecstasy and Special K (ketamine). In his first book, Isherwood struggles to objectively report these events, providing a brief overview of the inner workings of the gay pornographic film business. This makes up somewhat for the lack of personal information on Stefano that would have enriched this account. Otherwise, much of the story is better suited to a feature-length article.

<p>Her earliest memories are of the wolves. And of the hunters who killed them and reclaimed her to human society—as a slave. Tanith has grown up as part of a savage, plundering clan, in a world ruled by brute strength, superstition, and animal cunning. Now, hated and shunned, Tanith flees human society for the more humane company of wolves. But the gentle son of a chief from a neighboring clan beckons her back. He offers Tanith the chance to join once again with her own kind. She must make her final choice of which cry to answer—the wavering, longing bellow of the human or the steady, beating call of the wolf.</p>


                        <p>When she is three-years-old, Tanith is taken from a den of wolves and lives for many years as the daughter of the chief of a warlike clan, until circumstances force her to choose between wolves and men.

Since the Native and non-Native worlds make such different demands, the quest for personal understanding is no easy one; addressing her non-Native audience, Joe says, ""It is hard for you to see our face, and sometimes it is hard for us to see ourselves.""

When he signed back on, his faithful following was prepared for the usual dose of wry humor, Clinton bashing, and brilliant banter.

Imposing a new format on a ""classic"" can be a tall order and a daunting task for a performer; fortunately, Susan Denaker's talents are level to the material. The book offers a full variety of challenges to a reader: over 60 characters, young and old, male and female, with accents from around the world. None of these pose any obstacle to Denaker, who deftly sculpts a voice for every one, including several famous historical characters. The Monteglane Service, a bejeweled chess set that holds great power, has been buried in an obscure abbey in the French countryside and later scattered throughout Europe to keep it out of the wrong hands. The tale takes place both in the 1790s and the 1970s, when it may finally fall into evil hands. Denaker is able to emphasize the appropriate speech nuances of each century with subtlety and deftness by adding the cadence of the aural to the mix. Perhaps the audio book, too, will reach cult status. <I>A Ballantine paperback (Reviews, Nov. 4, 1988).

Larque's loved ones accept her uncanny, unconscious, often embarrassing habit of producing temporary doubles - ""doppelgangers"" - of people and their inner aspects from out of thin air. But now her latest creation, herself at age ten, refuses to fade away quietly - leaving Larque no choice but to bear the taunts and accusations of the scabby-kneed golliwog girl she once was. For the child, Sky, will not accept the compromises Larque has made in her life - and, ultimately, leads her older self out into the vast, adult and mysterious night in search of lost dreams. Larque's nocturnal wanderings take her farther from home and hearth than she ever imagined possible - to the neon pinks and Day-Glo yellows of Popular Street, where life is exciting and gay. Here in this secret place, she meets the beautiful, tormented cowboy Shadow - and Argent, the handsome stud-lover Shadow has molded from the pliable clay of middle-aged angst. And it is here, beneath Shadow's talented fingers, that Larque herself is remade - becoming a new ""Lark,"" younger, stronger, more courageous...and male. But freedom is a pricey commodity - and there are those who would gladly clip Larque's newly formed wings. Her loving, gentle, bearlike husband Hoot desperately wants her back - steadfastly refusing to accept his wife as a muscular, teenaged boy. And her disapproving mother is especially dangerous - since she has the power to ""blink"" her errant daughter into some maternally approved, no-warts ideal. But the most fearsome adversary of all lurks deep within an already splintered Larque/Lark - a doppelganger in sensible shoes who, if released, could swallow up the Harootunian family whole and leave Popular Street in ruins: the dreaded Virtuous Woman.

Stereotypes Depict Islamic Societies As Economically Backward, Hyper-patriarchal, And Fanatically Religious. But In Fact, The Islamic World Encompasses A Great Diversity Of Cultures And A Great Deal Of Variation Within Those Cultures In Terms Of Gender Roles And Sexuality. The First Collection On This Topic From A Historical And Anthropological Perspective, Homosexuality In The Muslim World Reveals That Patterns Of Male And Female Homosexuality Have Existed And Often Flourished Within The Islamic World. Indeed, Same-sex Relations Have, Until Quite Recently, Been Much More Tolerated Under Islam Than In The Christian West. Based On The Latest Theoretical Perspectives In Gender Studies, Feminism, And Gay Studies, Homosexuality In The Muslim World Includes Cultural And Historical Analyses Of The Entire Islamic World, Not Just The So-called Middle East. Essays Show Both Age-stratified Patterns Of Homosexuality, As Revealed In The Erotic And Romantic Poetry Of Medieval Poets, And Gender-based Patterns, In Which Both Men And Women Might, To Varying Degrees, Choose To Live As Members Of The Opposite Sex. The Contributors Draw On Historical Documents, Literary Texts, Ethnographic Observation And Direct Observation By Both Muslim And Non-muslim Authors To Show The Considerable Diversity Of Islamic Societies And The Existence Of Tolerated Gender And Sexual Variances.

Coward's writing is playful, sarcastic, absurd; Hall's is brooding and melancholic, rife with misery and suffering. Where she throws her head back in despair, he merely lifts an eyebrow. Yet as Terry Castle displays in her provocative new study, the two had much more in common than critics have been willing to concede. The first look at the literary and biographical link between these influential contemporaries, Noel Coward and Radclyffe Hall recounts a forgotten literary friendship and shows that Coward and Hall even make subtle, ""ghostly"" appearances in each others' works. This captivating tale is brought to life in a series of 45 illustrations, including photographs of Hall, Coward, and others in their social circle, along with cartoon renditions of the two from the popular press. Through its imaginative juxtaposition of two major literary figures, this provocative work illuminates how traditional ideas of the differences between male and female homosexuals shield from view a vast arena of cultural understanding. Castle pushes past stale definitions - the tragic lesbian and the witty, urbane gay man - to present a broader picture. In the process, Noel Coward and Radclyffe Hall provides a rich critical vocabulary for bridging the experiences of gays and lesbians in history, casting light upon deep-rooted stereotypes that have long separated the two.",en,First Edition,"Height: 0.66 Inches, Length: 7.81 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 6.24 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/65/9780231105965.jpg,Success,112,19.4

Maria Buhrig here seeks to make the ""invisible"" role of women in the church visible, and to explain why, despite the service women have rendered to the church for centuries, they have either been silent or forced into silence. She discusses problems of methodology posed by the sheer paucity of texts, and by texts shaped by men; going on to discuss how women use the Bible, how the Bible has been used to oppress women, and the process of reinterpretation now taking place. She then examines images of God, the ""goddess"" movement, and feminine responses to Jesus. Her thought can be summed up in the phrase ""We women too are Church"". This is a much-needed book, one capable of building bridges between Christian feminists and traditionalists. It can explain Christian feminism to those who cannot see what it is trying to achieve, or why, in a way few - if any - Christian feminist works published to date are able to do.

A third woman survived, cowering in a sea cave until dawn. More than a century later, Jean, a magazine photographer working on a photoessay about the murders, returns to the Isles with her husband, Thomas, and their five-year-old daughter, Billie, aboard a boat skippered by her brother-in-law, Rich, who has brought along his girlfriend, Adaline. As Jean becomes immersed in the details of the 19th-century murders, Thomas and Adaline find themselves drawn together-with potentially ruinous consequences. Shreve (<i>Where or When</i>; <i>Resistance</i>) perfectly captures the ubiquitous dampness of life on a sailboat, deftly evoking the way in which the weather comes to dictate all actions for those at sea. With the skill of a master shipbuilder, Shreve carefully fits her two stories together, tacking back and forth between the increasingly twisted murder mystery and the escalating tensions unleashed by the threat of a dangerous shipboard romance. Written with assurance and grace, plangent with foreboding and a taut sense of inexorability, <i>The Weight of Water</i> is a powerfully compelling tale of passion, a provocative and disturbing meditation on the nature of love.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.16 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",28.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/74/9780316789974.jpg,Success,123,19.4

Mitchell, she confesses, was adopted - and Mitchell has an identical twin. This long-lost, separated-at-birth sibling isn't hard to find ... but he may be hard to take.

But Kitten thinks it's Mitchell who needs superego surgery, and she's just the gal to wield the scalpel.

                        <p>The unabashed author of Fag Hag and Closet Case chronicles the plight of Mitchell Sayer, a gay, urban professional whose well-ordered life is thrown into disarray when his mother--unburdening her soul en route to a Buddhist convent--reveals a devastating secret: Michael has a twin brother.

0-8032-1474-X,Automatic Woman: The Representation of Woman in Surrealism,"Conley, Katharine",University of Nebraska Press,189,10/1/1996,"Literary Criticism, Feminist",Hardcover,"<p><br>Contemporary feminist critics have often described Surrealism as a misogynist movement. In Automatic Woman, Katharine Conley addresses this issue, confirming some feminist allegations while qualifying and overturning others. Through insightful&nbsp;analyses of works by a range of writers and artists, Conley develops a complex view of Surrealist portrayals of Woman. <P>Conley begins with a discussion of the composite image of Woman developed by such early male Surrealists as Andr&#233; Breton, Francis Picabia, and Paul Eluard. She labels that image &#8220;Automatic Woman&#8221;&#8212;a term that comprises views of Woman as provocative and revolutionary but also as a depersonalized object largely devoid of individuality and volition. This analysis largely confirms feminist critiques of Surrealism. The heart of the book, however, examines the writings of Leonora Carrington and Unica Z&#252;rn, two women in the Surrealist movement whose works, Conley argues, anticipate much contemporary feminist art and theory. In concluding, Conley shows how Breton&#8217;s own views on women evolved in the course of his long career, arriving at last at a position far more congenial to contemporary feminists.</P><P>Automatic Woman is distinguished by Katharine Conley&#8217;s judicious understanding of how women&#8212;and the image of Woman&#8212;figured in Surrealism. The book is an important contemporary account of a cultural movement that continues to fascinate, influence, and provoke us.</P></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.46827866492 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/43/9780803214743.jpg,Success,117,19.4

Raging egomaniacs she can handle, but the streetwalkers in her neighborhood are another matter. She meets her match in tiny, tenacious Crystal, a street companion from her past. Crystal's younger sister, a drug-addicted prostitute, has been beaten to death in an alley, and Crystal is seeking revenge. Little Crystal, or ""Monkey Face,"" as Eva nicknames her, has the brains and she connections, but she needs the big wrestler's protection while she investigates. Her first step is to con Eva into teaching self-defense to an angry but easily distracted gang of street girls, and it doesn't take long for this dirty half dozen to wreck Eva's carefully organized, antisocial existence. She's banned from her training gym, in trouble with her high-rolling manager, and definitely on the wrong side of the law. Not even Anna Lee, Cody's well-known private investigator, can deter Eva from ripping off cars, clothes, and a few wallets as she makes the streets safe for women of all sizes. Pimps, punters, and out-of-control bodybuilders beware: with Eva and her two attack dogs on the prowl, the thugs better clear the aisle and let the London Lassassin come through.

                        <p>Eva Wylie, aka the London Lassassin, wants only to win the British women's heavyweight wrestling championship. But when a murderer who specializes in killing prostitues hits too close to home, Eva reluctantly interrupts her training to dole out her special--and unforgettable--brand of justice.

In this intimate and personal book fourteen contemporary Zuni potters tell us in their own words about the traditions and techniques of their craft—how they collect and handle clay, how they fire and decorate pots, and how they learn, develop, teach, and adapt their art. Some of these potters have learned in the traditional way from their mothers, but many have also taken advantage of modern mobility and education to learn at school and by visiting museum collections of pueblo pottery. Their work and their lives combine tradition and innovation.</p>
<p>Pottery is a traditional female art among the pueblos, but five of the potters included in this book are men. One potter uses an electric kiln at home but travels to workshops in the midwest with sheep manure so that she can demonstrate traditional firing techniques. All of them are as generous in sharing their stories in this book as they are in working cooperatively to develop their craft.</p>",en,,"Height: 11.75 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 1.46386941968 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",45,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/27/9780964140127.jpg,Success,91,19.4
0-19-510180-4,The Mythology of Transgression: Homosexuality as Metaphor,"Highwater, Jamake",Oxford University Press,272,1/16/1997,,Hardcover,"<br>
Jamake Highwater is a master storyteller and one of our most visionary writers, hailed as ""an eloquent bard, whose words are fire and glory"" (Studs Terkel) and ""a writer of exceptional vision and power"" (Anaïs Nin). Author of more than thirty volumes of nonfiction, fiction, and poetry, Highwater--considered by many to be the intellectual heir of Joseph Campbell--has long been intrigued by how our mythological legacies have served as a foundation of modern civilization. Now, in <em>The Mythology of Transgression</em>, he uses his remarkable narrative powers to offer a personal and extraordinarily far-ranging examination of how people who stand outside of society--by dint of their sexual orientation, physical appearance, ideas, artistic inclinations, or ethnic heritage--often achieve lasting, even profound influence upon the culture at large. <br>
 Drawing from a stunningly rich variety of sources ranging from the arts and literature to biology, physics, psychology, and anthropology, Highwater looks at his own outsider status--as a gay man, an artist, and an orphaned Native American--in an attempt to explore how mythologies from ancient times to the present have shaped the ways we think about social ""abnormality"" and alienation. Throughout, he points to a paradox at the center of Western values--the competing notions that the outsider is at once sinful and wise, that in everyday life the transgressor is ostracized, while in our most durable folklore and religious legends, heroes must break the rules to achieve greatness. Focusing in particular on homosexuality as a modern metaphor of transgression, Highwater brilliantly mixes personal anecdotes with wide ranging research, leading us on a tour through the history of social conformity and rejection, citing examples that span from Judeo-Christian-Islamic doctrines of good and evil, to the Navajo Nation's ambivalence toward the nature of sexuality, to Carson McCullers's treatment of physical deformity in the novella <em>Member of the Wedding</em>, to Descartes's theories of dualism. He also pays special attention to the debates currently raging in science regarding the biology of homosexuality and provides an engaging discussion of why we are motivated to seek a genetic basis of sexual orientation in the first place.<br>
 Jamake Highwater has long been celebrated as a writer uniquely suited to give voice to the social outsider. Often provocative, always fascinating, <em>The Mythology of Transgression</em> is a tour de force of eloquent scholarship, a book that will prompt discussion and debate on the subject for years to come.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.375 Inches, Weight: 1.2676580065 Pounds, Width: 1.001 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/05/9780195101805.jpg,Success,85,19.4

After more than a year the strikers lost their union certification, but the battle permanently altered the social order in these small, predominantly Hispanic mining towns. At the time the strike began, many women said they couldn't leave the house without their husband's permission. Yet, when injunctions barred union men from picketing, their wives and daughters turned out for the daily picket lines. When the strike dragged on and men left to seek jobs elsewhere, women continued to picket, organize support, and defend their rights even when the towns were occupied by the National Guard. ""Nothing can ever be the same as it was before,"" said Diane McCormick of the Morenci Miners Women's Auxiliary. ""Look at us. At the beginning of this strike, we were just a bunch of ladies.""</p>

This outstanding anthology shares poignant experiences of growing old from the perspectives of both women and men.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>""The need to be loved, the importance of family connections, an acceptance of the aging process,"" are all concerns of the contributors to this new collection by the editor of the Abby-winning When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple. These poems, short fiction and photos by men and women over 50, are written from experience and from the heart. In many cases, they pinpoint for an instant exactly how it feels to be older. In some, the best has already been, as in the devastating ""Choices"" by Nancy Robertson and ""Can Opener"" by Dianna Henning, two deceptively simple poems. But the romance of Anne C. Barnhill's story, ""Washing Helen's Hair,"" the surprise of Peter Meinke's ""A Woman Like That,"" and the guts and energy of ""Aerodynamic Integrity"" by Rose Hamilton-Gottlieb show a wealth of posibilities ahead. Each piece can be enjoyed for itself, but together they speak well for a growing but overlooked population. The many photos throughout show strength, resilience and devotion. Sooner or later, if they're lucky, everyone moves into this stage of life. And, as many of these writers point out, they're still the same inside, only the packaging has changed.

The young vet's second effort at detection takes her back into the world of Western cowhorses - the working horses of today's West. The pay's not great, but the work is rewarding, and Gail McCarthy is a horse vet with a hectic schedule - not to mention a dog, a horse, a house payment, and a new boyfriend all clamoring for attention. Her life is more than a little disrupted when she discovers two dead bodies during the course of a routine call. Murder is upsetting enough, but when a midnight emergency turns into an attempt on her own life, Gail begins to see the quiet beachside town of Santa Cruz as a rather frightening place. The cops are not too concerned with the situation, writing off the two deaths as the work of a vagrant and the attack on Gail as the work of an overactive imagination. Once again, the forthright young vet finds herself trying to catch a killer and restore some peace to her little world - before it's too late. Laura Crum has used her many years of training and showing cowhorses to craft a unique mystery where murder occurs in a world of modern cowboys and working horses.

It is presented in the form of a secret autobiography, a soul-baring document intended for the eyes of a single reader: Elizabeth's brother, lover, and spiritual other half - Victor Frankenstein. The writings are discovered by Sir Robert Walton, the Arctic explorer who, in Mary Shelley's original novel, recorded Victor's deathbed confession. Walton becomes obsessed with learning the full story behind the mad doctor's last words. From the tattered pages of Elizabeth's journal and the scattered clues Walton finds as he re-creates her life, a compelling tale of moral horror unfolds. In her memoirs, Elizabeth emerges as a spirited woman far ahead of her times. Rescued as a child from the Gipsies by the brilliant Lady Caroline Frankenstein, she is raised as young Victor's adopted sister. Under Lady Caroline's guidance, Elizabeth is initiated into a circle of cunning women - outsiders would call them witches - who are the guardians of long-forgotten pagan ceremonies and healing arts. She and Victor are schooled in ancient teachings that have been transmitted through female adepts who understand the mysteries of nature. The goal is to unite the two in the chemical marriage, a step toward the union of all opposites that will restore the Earth to balance. The two youths pursue their education through the shadowy realms of alchemical lore and tantric sexual rites until a moment of weakness disrupts the quest. Tormented by shame and anger, Victor turns to the unhallowed arts that result in his misbegotten Creature, the vengeful fiend who will haunt Elizabeth's fatal wedding night.                        <p>Rescued from an impoverished life among the Gypsies, raised by a remarkable noblewoman of Geneva, Elzabeth Lavenza was much more than a foster sister to Victor Frankenstein. Together, they forged a sensual bond and entered a world of mythical lore.

Wade decision in 1973, nearly thirty million legal abortions have been performed in the United States. Every year hundreds of thousands of women choose to have abortions. Yet a veil of secrecy is drawn across abortion sites, disturbed only by protest demonstrations and violence outside clinics. For years the antichoice movement has loudly condemned the abortion procedure. Opponents use such words as ""baby-killing,"" ""murder,"" and ""blood-dripping abortionists"" to describe what goes on in an abortion clinic - highly charged words that are intended to frighten women who are facing one of the most important decisions of their lives. What does - and does not - go on inside an abortion clinic? Why do women seek this procedure? Why would a physician specialize in this service? Why I Am An Abortion Doctor provides a unique, firsthand look at the life and work of a leading abortion provider. With compassion and courage Dr. Suzanne T. Poppema shares the intimate details of her private and professional struggle - including a view from the abortion clinic operating room as well as a recollection of her own fifth-month abortion - to promote better understanding of the reality of abortion and the violent forces that threaten a woman's right to choose. Dr. Poppema's journey has led her from a Catholic upbringing in rural New Hampshire to professional training at Harvard Medical School, where she made a critical career decision to forgo the fame and fortune awaiting those who enter lucrative medical specialties in favor of becoming a family physician. She has traveled to some of the poorest places on earth, where she observed the expendability of human life and the subjugation of women. Dr. Poppema's work has brought her a world-wide reputation as an authority on abortion. She served as a member of an international panel in Paris to discuss the French abortion pill, RU 486.

Both an affecting, outspoken autobiographical memoir and a veritable manual for women considering abortion, her personal testament (written with Henderson, who teaches at the University of Washington School of Communications) begins with her 12 years of rigid Catholic schooling in rural New Hampshire followed by the ordeal of Harvard Medical School, where her classmates disdained her choice of family medicine over a lucrative specialty. She also discusses her own abortion while an intern in Seattle. Poppema believes that wide availability of abortion would alleviate misery by preventing unwanted children and helping poor women break out of the cycle of poverty. She describes in clear detail the counseling of patients and how abortions are performed, and discusses her clinic's trials with the drug mifepristone (brand name RU 486), the French abortion pill, which she hopes will become easily available in the U.S. (Mar.)</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.3 Inches, Length: 6.3 Inches, Weight: 1.17 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",31.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/52/9781573920452.jpg,Success,110,19.4

Saturna's conception violates those laws, and therefore her very existence is a dangerous secret that could initiate interplanetary war.

But Kofman's Close Attachment To Meme Also Resulted In A Rupture Between Mother And Child That Was Never To Be Fully Healed. This Slender Volume Is Distinguished By The Author's Clear Prose, The Carefully Recounted Horrors Of Her Childhood, And The Uncommon Poise That Came To Her Only With The Passage Of Many Years.--jacket.

0-553-56452-8,Guilty as Sin: A Novel (Deer Lake Book 2),"Hoag, Tami",Bantam,624,2003,,Kindle Edition,"The abduction of eight-year-old Josh Kirkwood sent small-town Deer Lake, Minnesota, into a tailspin. Even now, after the arrest of a suspect and the return of the boy, fear maintains its grip and questions linger. What happened to Josh in the hands of his kidnapper? Why has he not spoken a word since his return, not even to name his abductor? Is the nightmare over or just beginning? Assistant County Attorney Ellen North knows her assignment to the Kirkwood case has landed her in the hot seat - a position she thought she'd left behind in the crime-choked Minneapolis court system. But politics and ulterior motives abound even in rural Park County. And if there was any hope of controlling the media frenzy, it is shattered when Ellen's boss grants full access of the case to bestselling true-crime writer Jay Butler Brooks. Now, as Ellen prepares for the trial of her career with an ex-lover arguing for the defense, her every move will be shadowed by Brooks, a man as mysterious as the case itself. All the while, another shadow follows Ellen with deadly intent. It is a soul-chilling whispered voice on the telephone. A knife-etched obscenity on the door of her car. The finger on the trigger of an apparent suicide...

                        <p>Night Sins, Hoag's impressive hardcover debut, revealed her to be a masterful spinner of spine-chilling thrills. Her new novel continues that bestselling momentum, bringing terror to a whole new level. As prosecutor Ellen North prepares her case against a kidnapper, she faces a sensation-driven press corps, political maneuvering, and her ex-lover as attorney for the defense.

Unfortunately, her professor father has speculated away the family money and died, leaving young Rosalind with no fortune and no future. Desolate with grief, forced to cut her education short, she agrees to go West to take a job as a governess to a wealthy man in San Francisco. A boom town in the 1850s, in 1905 San Francisco is the center of culture in the new West, and perhaps there she will rediscover a reason for living. But when she arrives at Jason Cameron's mansion on a hill overlooking the Pacific, she discovers that there are no children, not even a wife, in residence: just the gentleman himself and his enigmatic manservant. Penniless, Rosalind stays despite her misgivings. For the household is very odd indeed. Despite there being but one servant, the huge house is immaculate and food is prepared and served in the most elegant manner. Oddest of all is the master of the house: Rosalind never sees him, but communicates only through a speaking tube, and only at night. But then...she is happy. For her job in the household is to read to him: Latin, French, Greek, German - and she feels herself coming alive once more. As for Jason Cameron, through his contact with Rosalind, he, too, is renewed. An Adept and Alchemist, Master of the Element of Fire, he had attempted the old French werewolf transformation - and bungled it.

In 1993, this question became the center of a heated debate when President Clinton attempted to lift the long-standing ban on gays in the military. This debate persists because the compromise policy ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue,"" faces serious legal challenges, and is likely to go to the Supreme Court before the end of the decade. Just below the surface of this debate rages a more general argument about the status of gay people in America.</p>
<p>Both sides base their views on assumptions about the consequences of integration. Even defenders of the ban grudgingly acknowledge that homosexuals are fully capable of serving with distinction. Few question gay service members' abilities or patriotism; justifications for the ban are now predicated on heterosexuals' negative reactions.</p>
<p><i>Out in Force</i> refutes the notions that homosexuality is incompatible with military service and that gay personnel would undermine order and discipline. Leading social science scholars of sexual orientation and the military offer reasoned and comprehensive discussions about military organizations, human sexuality, and attitudes toward individuals and groups. They demonstrate forcefully that the debate is really about the military as an institution, and how that institution will adapt to larger social changes. The contributors show that the ban could be successfully eliminated, and set forth a program for implementation. In sorting opinion from fact, myth from reality, <i>Out in Force</i> stands as an invaluable guide for the military, lawmakers, and the courts as they continue to grapple with this question of institutional and societal change.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.0582188576 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/88/9780226400488.jpg,Success,87,19.4

Yet health and health care cannot be viewed outside of the social context. We cannot, William B. Rubenstein, Ruth Eisenberg, and Lawrence O. Gostin insist, lose sight of the fact that the questions involved in living with HIV disease are often human rights issues that are negotiated through the legal system. Can a hospital refuse to treat me because I’m infected? Can my insurance company terminate my coverage? Will the government deport me? Who has a right to know of my health status?</p>
<p>The health policies, practices, and programs generated by the HIV epidemic also give rise to legal questions: Can doctors be forcibly tested and removed from practice if they are infected with HIV? Can hospital patients be required to have HIV tests? What are the responsibilities of a pregnant woman with HIV infection? Do school children have a right to information about HIV disease?</p>
<p>In fact, legal questions affecting HIV-positive people have grown tremendously complex, cutting across multiple areas of life as well as of law. Using the question-and-answer format common to all ACLU handbooks, this book makes clear how to take advantage of the laws designed to secure the rights of people who are HIV positive.</p>
<p>The authors have divided the book into four sections. The first five chapters provide background information about HIV disease and about the public health response to the epidemic. The second five chapters deal with day-to-day issues: health care decisions, private and public insurance, available public benefits, planning in consideration of futureincapacity and death, and issues of HIV within families. The third section considers discrimination against people with HIV in accessing health care, in places of public accommodation, in the workplace, and in the housing market. The book concludes with a look at HIV in schools and prisons and among immigrants and drug users.</p>

These women defied the military dictatorship by embroidering their sorrow on scraps of cloth and using their needles and thread as one of the boldest means of popular protest and resistance in Latin America. The arpilleras they made - patch-work tapestries with scenes of everyday life and memorials to their disappeared relatives - were smuggled out of Chile and brought to the world the story of their fruitless searches in jails, morgues, government offices, and the tribunals of law for their husbands, brothers, and sons. Marjorie Agosin, herself a native of and exile from Chile, has spent over twenty years interviewing the arpilleristas and following their work. She knows their stories intimately and knows, too, that not one of them has ever found a disappeared relative alive. Still, many of them maintain hope and continue to make their arpilleras. Even though the dictatorship ended in 1989 and democracy returned to Chile, no full account of the detained and disappeared has ever been offered. This book includes a history of the women's movement, testimonies from the women in their own words, and, for the first time, full color plates of their beautiful, moving, and ultimately hopeful arpilleras. Anyone interested in the history of contemporary Latin America will want to read this powerful story.

                        <p>""Arpilleras are burlap-backed tapestries depicting the experiences and emotions of women whose sons and husbands were arrested and never heard from again during the years of military rule.

Thus Umm Ali sums up the nearly impossible challenge of her daily existence. Living in a poor neighborhood of Cairo, she has raised eight children with almost no help from her husband or the Egyptian government and through hardships from domestic violence to constant quarrels over material possessions.<p>Umm Ali's story is amazing not only for what it reveals about her resourcefulness but for the light it sheds on the resilience of Cairo's poor in the face of disastrous poverty. Like countless other poor people in Cairo, she has developed a personal buoyancy to cope with relentless economic need. It stems from a belief in the ability of people to shape their own destiny and helps explain why Cairo remains virtually free of the social ills&#8212;violent street crime and homelessness&#8212;that have eroded the lives of poor people in other major cities.<p>Unni Wikan first met Umm Ali and her family twenty-five years ago and has returned almost every year. She draws on her firsthand experience of their lives to create an intimate portrait of Cairo's back streets and the people who live there. Wikan's innovative approach to ethnographic writing reads like a novel that presents the experiences of Umm Ali's family and neighbors in their own words.<p>As Umm Ali recounts triumphs and defeats&#8212;from forming a savings club with neighbors to the gradual drifting away and eventual return of her husband&#8212;she unveils a deeply reflective attitude and her unwavering belief that she can improve her situation. Showing how Egyptian culture interprets poverty and family, this book attests to the capacity of an individual's self-worth to withstand incredible adversity.<p></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Details economic trends in Latin America and the Caribbean in 1993, with sections on macroeconomic policy and inflation, level of activity, total supply and demand, employment and wages, public finances, foreign trade, and external financing.

Isobel's husband&#8212;a gentleman of mature years&#8212;is felled by a mysterious and agonizing ailment. The Earl's death seems a cruel blow of fate for the newly married Isobel. Yet the bereaved widow soon finds that it's only the beginning of her misfortune...as she receives a sinister missive accusing her and the Earl's nephew of adultery&#8212;and murder. Desperately afraid that the letter will expose her to the worst sort of scandal, Isobel begs Jane for help. And Jane finds herself embroiled in a perilous investigation that will soon have her following a trail of clues that leads all the way to Newgate Prison and the House of Lords&#8212;a trail that may well place Jane's own person in the gravest jeopardy.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>With this series opener, Barron catches the Jane Austen popularity wave with impeccable timing-but that may be the best that can be said of this debut. Purportedly editing Austen manuscripts found in an old Maryland estate, Barron recounts the suspicious death of the elderly Frederick Payne, Earl of Scargrave. Anonymous notes accuse Isobel, Austen's friend and Payne's young bride, and a ""grey-hared Lord"" of murdering the earl. Intensifying Isobel's misery is Lord Harold Trowbridge, who badgers the widow to sell him her estate in Barbados. Concerned for her friend and for Fitzroy Payne, the new earl who not-so-secretly loves Isobel, Austen undertakes snooping that leads her to a second corpse and leads Isobel and Fitzroy to trial before the House of Lords. As Austen explores a passel of suspects who are heavy-handedly cast as the originals for the characters in her novels, the reader is offered imitation scholarly footnotes. To be truly helpful, Barron might have better explained how Austen hears Big Ben, a bell cast some 40 years after her death. Austen as mystery writer is an appealing idea, but inadequately served here. Author tour.

In Lucid And Often Poetic Prose, She Offers A Dazzlingly Complete Portrait That Is Essential To Our Reading Of Woolf. Rich In Detail And Imaginative Insight, Art And Affection Meticulously Documents How The Twin Desires To Write And To Be Loved Drove Woolf All Her Life. Drawing On A Wealth Of Original Documents, Many Unfamiliar And Heretofore Unpublished, Including The Surviving Letters Of Woolf's Parents And Grandmother, The Vast Collection Of Letters Written Among Bloomsbury Friends And Acquaintances, The Manuscripts Of Woolf's Writing, Her Suicide Notes, And Other Sources, Reid Allows Woolf And Her Intimates To Speak For Themselves. Her Findings Correct Many Misconceptions About Woolf's Upbringing And Her Most Significant Relationships. She Reveals, For Instance, That Recent Reports Of Sexual Abuse In Woolf's Childhood Have Been Exaggerated - That While The Writer Was Sexually Traumatized By Her Half-brothers And Emotionally Scarred By Her Father, She Was Most Deeply Wounded By The Neglect Of Her Mother (often Depicted As The Very Model Of Victorian Maternal Devotion) And By Her Love For And Rivalry With Her Sister, The Painter Vanessa Bell. Reid Describes The Competition Between The Sisters That Became For Virginia A Contest Between Their Arts, The Pen Versus The Brush. The Effects Of This Rivalry Were Not Uniformly Negative - Reid Shows That Virginia's Jealous Preoccupation With Modern Painting Sparked Her Own Aesthetic Vision And Experimentation With Written Forms - But The End Results Were Tragic. Virginia's Flirtation With Vanessa's Husband, Carefully Documented Here, So Alienated Her Sister That After 1910 Virginia Never Again Felt Secure Of Vanessa's Affection. Reid Presents Powerful Evidence That Fear Of Losing Both Vanessa's Love And Her Own Writing Gift Ultimately Triggered Woolf's Final Suicidal Depression. She Also Reevaluates Virginia's Marriage To The Writer And Publisher Leonard Woolf, And Finds That Leonard Was Surprisingly Supportive Of Virginia's Erotic Relationship With Vita Sackville-west And That His Constant Devotion Provided Virginia With The Secure Emotional Soil In Which Art And Affection Could Flourish And She Could Keep At Bay, Until Her Fifty-ninth Year, The Demons Of Manic-depression.

This is the question that Kathleen Norris herself asks as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at a Benedictine monastery. Yet upon leaving the monastery, she began to feel herself transformed, and the daily events of her life on the Great Plains - from her morning walk to her going to sleep at night - gradually took on new meaning. She found that in the monastery, time slowed down, offering a new perspective on community, family, and even small-town life. By coming to understand the Benedictine practice of celibacy, she felt her own marriage enriched; through the communal reading aloud of the psalms every day, her notion of the ancient oral tradition of poetry came to life; and even the mundane task of laundry took on new meaning through the lens of Benedictine ritual. Writing with lyrical grace, Kathleen Norris here takes us through a liturgical year, as she experienced it both within the monastery and outside it. She shows us, from the rare perspective of someone who is both insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world - its liturgy, its rituals, its sense of community - can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. Through her masterly prose and rare insight, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>The allure of the monastic life baffles most lay people, but in her second book Norris (Dakota) goes far in explaining it. The author, raised Protestant, has been a Benedictine oblate, or lay associate, for 10 years, and has lived at a Benedictine monastery in Minnesota for two. Here, she compresses these years of experience into the diary of one liturgical year, offering observations on subjects ranging from celibacy to dealing with emotions to Christmas music. Like the liturgy she loves, this meandering, often repetitive book is perhaps best approached through the lectio divina practiced by the Benedictines, in which one tries to ""surrender to whatever word or phrase captures the attention."" There is a certain nervous facility to some of Norris's jabs at academics, and she is sometimes sanctimonious. But there is no doubting her conviction, exemplified in her defense of the much-maligned Catholic ""virgin martyrs,"" whose relevance and heroism she wants to redeem for feminists. What emerges, finally, is an affecting portrait-one of the most vibrant since Merton's-of the misunderstood, often invisible world of monastics, as seen by a restless, generous intelligence.

Both a basic social relationship and a model for other social hierarchies, gender helped determine the construction of racial categories and the institution of slavery in Virginia. But the rise of racial slavery also transformed gender relations, including ideals of masculinity.</p>
<p>In response to the presence of Indians, the shortage of labor, and the insecurity of social rank, Virginia's colonial government tried to reinforce its authority by regulating the labor and sexuality of English servants and by making legal distinctions between English and African women. This practice, along with making slavery hereditary through the mother, contributed to the cultural shift whereby women of African descent assumed from lower-class English women both the burden of fieldwork and the stigma of moral corruption.</p>
<p>Brown's analysis extends through Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, an important juncture in consolidating the colony's white male public culture, and into the eighteenth century. She demonstrates that, despite elite planters' dominance, wives, children, free people of color, and enslaved men and women continued to influence the meaning of race and class in colonial Virginia.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9.21258 Inches, Length: 6.14172 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 1.0377932 Inches",19.87,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/30/9780807846230.jpg,Success,5,19.4
