BEYOND THE PALE
Elana Dykewomon
A remarkable historical chronicle destined to become a feminist and lesbian

York at the turn of the century. They are women who lead extraordinary lives

HE
VALKYRIE
By Roz Warren
If you loved Wonder Woman when you were a girl,
yovw'll be as excited as I am about Trina Robbins’ terrific
new book, The Great Women Superheros ($21.95 pb,
0-87816-481-2, Kitchen Sink). Beautifully written by a
woman who is a feminist cartoonist herself, this book is
a wealth of information about those flying, fighting,
fabulous women. (For instance, did you know that
psychologist Dr. William Moulton Marston, who cre-
ated Wonder Woman, also invented the lie detector?
Robbins records that Marston's initial suggestion to
publishers that girls might want to “read about and
identify with a strong heroine” was “met by a storm of
mingled protests and guffaws.”) There are great graph-
ics on every page (my favorite being the moment when
70s superhero Valkyrie first realizes that she has some-
how gained “fantastic strength! unbelievable power!”
and cries out: “Male Chauvinist Pigs — Beware!”).
Robbins tells the stories of a number of 40s—era women
superheros that I had been unaware of (many of whom
were drawn by women), as well as many whose adven-
tures I remember eagerly paying twelve cents a book to
read about when I was a kid. Best of all, this book is
grounded in a feminist worldview. Robbins places these
characters in historical and political contexts, and ques- Valkyrie, from Marvel comics, in The Great Women

Two Insightful New Resources from Guilford
Growing Up in a Lesbian Family
Fiona L. Tasker and Susan Golombok
“The authors effectively challenge assumptions about the ways in which
parents of any sexuality influence their children’s development...….If
evidence has any effect on prejudice, this book should go a long way
toward ending discrimination against lesbian mothers and reassuring
those who need it that the children raised by lesbians are in no way
disadvantaged or harmed by their upbringing. In fact, the book points
to several benefits for children growing up in a lesbian-led family.”

book explores an intriguing topic — the spiritual
aspects of knitting and other handicrafts (usually
women’s). According to Lydon, “The hands of knitters
and craftspeople spin tales of creation, life, death,
geneaology, and history; they connect us to the heavens,
the ages and the earth itself at once. To knit is to be freed
from time and the constraints of everyday life, to take
our place at the table of the ancients, to claim citizenship
of the entire planetary culture and relationship with the
widest community of people from the present to the
past.” $18/C9$25 cl, 0-06-251202-1.

The Activist's Daughter
Ellyn Bache
ISBN 1-883523-18-4 $10.95 (Pub. date: May 1997)
'The moving account of a young woman's rebellion against her unconventional
mother's involvement in the '60s civil rights movement by enrolling at The
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in the heart of the segregated South.
"Ellyn Bache has written a wonderful coming of age book. She beautifully
delineates a young woman's rebellious nature in conflict with itself. In showing
us Beryl Rosinsky’s serious intentions and giddy impulses, her cowardice and
her bravery, she reminds us how we've all made irreversible life choices before
we were old enough to know what life is." — Margaret Maron, author of the
Edgar Award-winning Deborah Knott mysteries
Deadline for Murder
Val McDermid
ISBN 1-883523-17-6 $10.95 (Pub. date: April 1997)
From the critically acclaimed author of the Kate Brannigan series! When ace
reporter Lindsay Gordon travels to Glasgow in search of her estranged lover
Cordelia Brown, there are some surprises in store for her: Cordelia is partnered
with someone else; Lindsay's ex-lover, journalist Alison Maxwell, has been
murdered; and Lindsay's friend Jackie Mitchell has been tried and convicted of
the crime. As Lindsay investigates, she is drawn into a tangled web of lies,
secrets, and intrigue surrounding Alison's colorful life and untimely demise.
Along the way, she uncovers blackmail, prostitution, betrayal of trust,
the theft of classified State papers — and a long list of suspects who wanted
Alison Maxwell dead.
