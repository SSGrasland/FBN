0-226-04022-4,When Men Meet: Homosexuality and Modernity,"Bech, Henning",University Of Chicago Press,324,3/15/1997,"Social Sciences, Discrimination & Race Relations",Paperback,"<p><p>For sociologist Henning Bech, the image of the male homosexual has become emblematic of the modern urban condition, in which freedom and mobility contend with transience and superficiality, in which possibility, energy, and engagement vie with uncertainty and restlessness. In this powerful and frankly provocative critique, Bech skillfully examines the distinctive relationship between urban modernism and the gay experience, exploring in compelling fashion its growing ramifications for the cultural mainstream. <p>Gay society has persevered, even flourished, in this highly charged urban environment, aestheticizing and sexualizing the spaces, both public and private, where men meet. With profound insight and honesty, Bech details this world, candidly reflecting on sex, friendship, love, and life as manifest in the homosexual form of existence. He convincingly demonstrates that, in the face of modern alienation, successful coping strategies developed by gay men are gradually being adopted by mainstream heterosexual society. <p>These adaptations are often masked by what Bech calls an absent homosexuality,  in which sublimated themes of homosexuality and masculine love surface, only to be disavowed in expressions of social anxiety. This absent homosexuality acts as a kind of cultural filter, allowing key traits of gay life to be absorbed by the mainstream, while shielding heterosexual males from their own homophobic anxieties. Ultimately, Bech foresees, a postmodern convergence of hetero- and homosexual forms of exisce emergent from this urban landscape and, with it, a new masculine synthesis. <p>Certain to ignite immediate controversy, <i>When Men Meet</i> offers both a penetrating scholarly analysis of the modern homosexual condition and an unflinching cultural vision of the masculine in transition.<p></p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/26/9780226040226.jpg,Success,119,20.1

In the title story of Gina Berriault's latest collection, an unsure young actress watches as wrenching changes take place, row upon row, bed upon bed, in the women's ward of a hospital where she fills in as a social worker. Finding there both kindness and harsh fate, she also discovers a reflection of her own life. Nine new stories are included in this collection of thirty-five. All are such models of economy that they seem almost telepathic. Berriault employs her vital sensibility - sometimes subtly ironic and sometimes achingly raw - to touch on the inevitability of suffering and the nature of individuality, daring to see into the essence of our predicaments. What moves us? What dictates our behavior? What alters us? These stories illustrate Berriault's depth of emotional understanding: the tragic loss of innocence in ""The Stone Boy,"" where nine-year-old Arnold accidentally kills his brother with a shotgun; the pointed wit in ""God and the Article Writer"" where a man is first demeaned and then elated by his submission to the people he interviews.",en,Reprint,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.09375 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/89/9781887178389.jpg,Success,110,20.1

But in 1993-amid considerable attention from the national academic community-Jane Gallop, a prominent feminist professor of literature, was accused of sexual harassment by two of her women graduate students. In Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment, Gallop tells the story of how and why she was charged with sexual harassment and what resulted from the accusations. Weaving together memoir and theoretical reflections, Gallop uses her dramatic personal experience to offer a vivid analysis of current trends in sexual harassment policy and to pose difficult questions regarding teaching and sex, feminism and knowledge.
<p>Comparing ""still new"" feminism-as she first encountered it in the early 1970s-with the more established academic discipline that women's studies has become, Gallop makes a case for the intertwining of learning and pleasure. Refusing to acquiesce to an imperative of silence that surrounds such issues, Gallop acknowledges-and describes-her experiences with the eroticism of learning and teaching. She argues that antiharassment activism has turned away from the feminism that created it and suggests that accusations of harassment are taking aim at the inherent sexuality of professional and pedagogic activity rather than indicting discrimination based on gender-that antiharassment has been transformed into a sensationalist campaign against sexuality itself.</p>
<p>Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment offers a direct and challenging perspective on the complex and charged issues surrounding the intersection of politics, sexuality, feminism, and power. Gallop's story and her characteristically bold way of telling it will be compelling reading for anyone interested in these issues and particularly to anyone interested in the ways they pertain to the university.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.33951188348 Pounds, Width: 0.29 Inches",18.19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/84/9780822319184.jpg,Success,115,20.1

Until I Was Ten, She Writes, Three Things Were True. We Always Had A Car. We Always Had A Backyard. And We Lived With My Father. Hard Times Set In When Veronica's Father Quit His Job To Become A Full-time Nightclub Performer And Soon After Quit The Family, Too. The Job Of Raising Veronica And Her Little Brother, Malcolm X Chambers, Was Left Exclusively To Her Mother, A Panamanian Immigrant Whose Secretary's Salary Just Barely Met The Needs Of Her Family. From A Young Age, Veronica Understood That The Best She Could Do For Her Mother Was To Be A Perfect Child - To Rewrite Her Christmas Wish Lists To Her Mother's Budget, To Look After Her Difficult Brother, To Get By On Her Own. More Than A Family Memoir, Mama's Girl Gives Voice To The First Generation Of African-americans To Come Of Age In The Post-civil Rights Era.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>while Billed As A Memoir From The Post-civil Rights Generation, Chambers's Remarkable Story-told With Admirable If Sometimes Frustrating Control-is Very Much Her Own.

Chambers Grew Up In Brooklyn In The 1970s, Her Mother Enduring, Her Father Violent And Philandering. The Marriage Broke Up. Cecilia Chambers Downplayed Her Daughter's Scholastic Achievements, More Worried About Her Struggling Son, And Never Discussed Sex. So The Author Absorbed The World On Her Own, In School, In The Hair Salon, Ambitious To Reap The Opportunities Black Trailblazers Had Sown. A Fight With Her Mother Sent Her To Her Father; There She Survived A Stepmother Of Fairy-tale Cruelty And Her Dad's Rage. She Escaped, At 16, To Simon's Rock College In The Berkshires, Where She Learned To Claim Her Black Identity And Was Launched On A Path Of Academic And Professional Success (including A Stint As An Editor Of The New York Times Magazine). Chambers Writes Of A Tender, Belated Rapprochement With Her Mother, And A Daughter's Gift-in Money And Support-that Allows Cecilia To Be Finally More Than Just Coping. Some Threads Of Chambers's Story, Particularly The Path Of Her Imprisoned Brother, Are Underdeveloped, But This Remains An Impressive Debut, All The More So Since The Author Is Just 25.

Exploring this dynamic in Charlotte Bronta's <i>Villette</i>, Mary Elizabeth Braddon's <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i>, George Eliot's <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, and Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i>, she argues that although women's disclosures to male confessors repeatedly depict wrongdoing committed against them, they themselves are viewed as the transgressors. Bernstein emphasizes the secularization of confession, but she also places these narratives within the context of the anti-Catholic tract literature of the time. Based on cultural criticism, poststructuralism, and feminist theory, Bernstein's analysis constitutes a reassessment of Freud's and Foucault's theories of confession. In addition, her study of the anti-Catholic propaganda of the mid-nineteenth century and its portrayal of confession provides historical background to the meaning of domestic confessions in the literature of the second half of the century.</p>

Examining British novels written in 1890-1914, Jane Eldridge Miller demonstrates how these social, legal, and economic changes rendered the traditional narratives of romantic desire and marital closure inadequate, forcing Edwardian novelists to counter the limitations and ideological implications of those narratives with innovative strategies. The original and provocative novels that resulted depict the experiences of modern women with unprecedented variety, specificity, and frankness. <i>Rebel Women</i> is a major re-evaluation of Edwardian fiction and a significant contribution to literary history and criticism.

In this revised and enlarged edition, author Raquel Martin continues to pick up where most doctors leave off, providing additional information and examining recent findings on this quickly developing subject. Many of the physical discomforts that women face-from menstrual cramping to symptoms of menopause-may actually result from a deficiency of natural progesterone combined with estrogen dominance. More and more women are seeking nondrug alternatives to synthetic hormones and their unpleasant and sometimes dangerous side effects such as osteoporosis or cancer of the breast, cervix, or uterus. Fortunately, safe plant-based alternatives are now available. One of these, found in the roots of the wild yam, is nearly identical to the progesterone produced in our bodies and is thus easily absorbed. Botanical progesterone supplementation is useful in treating or preventing many conditions, including PMS, menstrual irregularity, infertility, depression, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and osteoporosis. It is also extremely effective in relieving or avoiding the discomforts of menopause. Martin sifts through the often confusing spate of studies on hormone replacement therapy and guides readers to the natural alternatives, and in this new edition she adds insight on conditions related to breast cancer, fibromyalgia, and osteoporosis. Additions to the book address the therapeutic use of essential oils, methods for detecting hormone levels and bone density, and the myths of mammography. Martin offers advice on how to work with a physician to come up with a personalized approach and lists mail-order sources for botanical progesterone creams and supplements.

                        <p>Provides information on how botanical progesterone therapy can provide relief of PMS, fibromyalgia, miscarriages, etc.

This biography tells of the obstacles she faced and how she overcame adversity to follow her dreams of flying.</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Fear was not an emotion known to Beryl Markham. Whether as a horse trainer or pilot, or just living among wild animals, she strove to succeed and never look back. Growing up in early twentieth-century British East Africa (now known as Kenya), she spent most of her childhood outdoors, barefoot, and in the company of her African servant and his son. Abandoned physically by her mother and emotionally by her father, a series of governesses, teachers, and housekeepers could not teach her any of the feminine skills of the time period. Adulthood brought a series of unsuccessful marriages, renown as a female pilot who dared fly solo from England to New York in 1936, and an eventual return to Kenya. Adventure figured strongly in whatever she did. There is little warmth in the retelling of her life story-which often includes quotes from her memoir West with the Night (North Point Press, 1985)-perhaps reflecting the loveless existence she led. The connectedness one might feel from reading a biographical portrait is missing here; events in Markham's life seem more strung together than a flowing story that draws the reader in. Index.

Part memoir, part travelogue, and part exploration of the beauty and power of language, The Names of Things captures the imagination with delight and detail. This widely reviewed and praised title is a beautifully written book that superlatively manages to combine linguistic scholarship, philosophy, and adventure into a profoundly original and magical book. It enchants in several mutually illuminating ways: as a finely written travel book about Egypt and its desert people, as a celebration of the mystery of language and its power of revelation and creation, and as a refined, poignant memoir of the making of a soul. She sees with an artist's eye and listens with the ear of a poet, interweaving her travels with her personal and family background. It is a literally amazing and wonderful book. In prose that is spare yet richly descriptive, Morrow describes her childhood growing up in a small town near the Finger Lakes; recalls her early fascination with words and language; and talks of the unexpected deaths of her brother and sister -- losses that would forever influence the way Morrow experiences and views the world. She tells how she left home at sixteen to immerse herself in the study of Arabic and Egyptian hieroglyphs at Barnard, and how this led to her first of many trips to the desert. As she shares tales from her courageous travels in places where it's still rare for women to be unaccompanied, Morrow gives an illuminating view of the desert and its people, offers fascinating insights into the nature of language and life, and articulates the struggle of many women to reconcile a need for independence with the ties of love and commitment. All of these are topics that she's well-prepared to discuss in an interview.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.24 Inches, Length: 6.42 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/79/9781573220279.jpg,Success,128,20.1

Raised in the glittering French court, returning to Scotland to rule as a Catholic monarch over a newly Protestant country, and executed like a criminal in Queen Elizabeth’s England, Queen Mary lived a life like no other, and Margaret George weaves the facts into a stunning work of historical fiction.</p>

Rather than accept conventional conceptual dichotomies of public and private or man and citizen, Fermon suggests that Rousseau's teachings on the family represent a connecting strand in an overarching philosophy: man not only creates institutions to satisfy his own needs, she writes, but the needs themselves are crucially formed and transformed by the social setting and the educational experience. Thus the family in general and women in particular play a key role in the Rousseaurean project, as the household becomes entrusted not only with the reproduction of life and daily necessities, but with the reproduction of sociality itself.",en,First Edition,Weight: 1 Pounds,2.45,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/57/9780819563057.jpg,Success,121,20.1

How well do national agendas address all women's health care priorities? What are the implications for social action?

1-55970-387-3,Jane Austen: Obstinate Heart,"Myer, Valerie Grosvenor",Arcade Publishing,288,4/28/1997,,Hardcover,"At the heart of Jane Austen's story lies a mystery: how a woman of ""genteel poverty,"" the seventh child of a country clergyman, an unmarried spinster for whom life was often a struggle against the indignities of financial dependency, could have produced works of such magnificent warmth and wisdom. Valerie Grosvenor Myer's flawless research proves Austen's books grew from the preoccupations of her social set - respectability, financial security, and most of all, marriage. ""It is a truth universally acknowledged,"" begins Pride and Prejudice, ""that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."" In that one line are revealed the principal forces at work in Austen's novels - and in the world from which they were drawn. For many middle-class women of Austen's day, marriage was paradoxically the only method of achieving independence. Marriage could also be a life sentence. Myer shows that by many accounts Austen was pretty and flirtatious (though occasionally also sharp-tongued), and the object of at least two proposals, but obstinate in her refusal to marry for other than love. Her obstinacy condemned her to reliance on her family for financial support. As Myer points out, it also enabled Austen to write her immortal novels. Using letters, family memories, and of course the novels themselves, Myer provides a detailed and revealing look at Jane Austen - her relationship with her beloved sister Cassandra, her devotion to and pride in her brothers and their children (who remembered ""Aunt Jane"" with warm affection), and her independence of mind and spirit. Austen's fondest dream was to establish herself not as another ""silly female novelist,"" but as a serious and self-supporting writer. She reveled in the reviews of those of the novels published - anonymously - during her brief lifetime. Yet as Myer shows, no one, least of all Austen herself, could have imagined her posthumous popularity.",en,2nd prt.,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/71/9781559703871.jpg,Success,127,20.1

She Finds That Certain Characteristics Such As Ideal, Beautiful, Decorative, And Pure Both Describe This Art And Define The Perceived Role Of Women In American Society At The Time. Van Hook First Places The American Artists In An International Context By Discussing The Works Of Their French Teachers, Including Jean-leon Gerome And Alexandre Cabanel. She Goes On To Explore Why They Soon Had To Distance Themselves From That Context, Primarily Because Their Art Was Perceived As Either Openly Sensual Or Too Obliquely Foreign By American Audiences. Van Hook Delineates The Modes Of Representation The American Painters Chose, Which Ranged From The More Traditional Allegorical Or Mythological Subjects To A Decorative Figure Painting Indebted To Whistler. Changing American Culture Ultimately Rejected These Idealized Female Images As Too Genteel And, Eventually, Too Academic And European. Ideal Women As The International Language Of Art -- The Return Home : What To Paint? -- Ideal Women In Late Nineteenth Century American Art : Modes Of Representation -- Modes Of Representation Continued : Mural Painting -- Ideal And Real -- Beautiful And Decorative -- Pure And American.

The showgirl lover of a dead New York mafioso is murdered in Las Vegas. Her last words are difficult to understand but included the name of Verico, which might refer to a bio-research company in New Jersey. An Ivy League scientist is found dead in a Boston parking lot after a job interview at Verico. And the Mafia has secretly invested in this firm doing cutting-edge work with recombinant DNA. Cavanaugh knows it's all tied together, but not how, and he doesn't have enough hard evidence to convince his boss there's a case anywhere. People keep dying, but nothing makes sense, and Cavanaugh gets more desperate to find the key.

                        <p>Two people are murdered in different parts of the country and a maverick FBI agent knows that both are somehow connected to a Mafia investment in a biotech engineering firm. He joins forces with the widow of a murdered scientist to find out how, and the answers are really bizarre and convincingly frightening. HC: Forge.

<p>The American author Alan Brown crosses both racial and cultural lines to tell his story through the eyes of a young, handsome Japanese cartoonist, Toshiyuki (""Toshi"") Okamoto, who traces his strong attraction to Western women bock to his ninth birthday, when his mother took him to see Audrey Hepburn in the movie ""Roman Holiday.""</p>
<p>Leaving behind a sad, silent childhood — which was spent living in two rooms above the family noodle shop on an isolated peninsula in the far north of Japan — Toshi moves to Tokyo to pursue his career. There he falls under the spell of three Americans: his best friend and confidante, the generous and extroverted Paul, a gay advertising copywriter who has plenty of his romantic mishaps with Japanese men; Jane, his glamorous but emotionally unstable teacher at the Very Romantic English Academy, with whom Toshi has a hazardous sexual affair; and, finally, the lovely and talented composer, Lucy, with whom Toshi falls in love.</p>
<p> The novel deftly moves back and forth between present and past, as Toshi explores his unhappy childhood, the reasons behind his mother's unexplained abandonment when he was eight years old, and her move to a seaside inn across the peninsula. As the novel draws to a close, tragic events, both public and personal, bring past and present together, revealing the painful truth of Toshi's parents' lives during World War II, and a secret in Toshi's own past that, in the end, gives him the strength and knowledge to confront the future.</p>


                        <p>Bursting with energy, wit, and surprising imagery, this thoroughly charming debut novel is as unique as it is compelling. From the day he first saw her in Roman Holiday, young Toshi has been infatuated with Audrey Hepburn. Now an adult making his way in Tokyo, he feels the contours of his life collide as he tries to balance his family's secrets, his mystifying American friends and lovers, and his own burgeoning identity.

Now, with this unique book, Carolyn Russo and the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum set the record straight by celebrating America's unsung pilots. Ninety spectacular duotone photographs, accompanied by extensive interviews and biographical sketches, capture thirty-six women aviators and astronauts from all walks of airborne life. The range of the women included is inspiring, from an eighty-eight-year-old who still operates an airfield to the first woman assigned to fly a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft for the U.S. Air Force; from the only Eskimo woman aviator in Alaska, Ellen Paneok - or Owl Eyes to the Eskimo elders - to Shannon Lucid, the astronaut who set an American record for length of time in space. Here are women in commercial and military occupations: a skywriter, a crop duster, an aerial photographer, a cattle herder, a helitack pilot, sport aviators, and several women in the U.S. Armed Forces, including one of the first female Navy combat pilots. For anyone interested in aviation and space flight, women trailblazers, and photography, Women and Flight is a fascinating journey of discovery.                        <p>Women pilots took to the skies soon after the Wright brothers, but only a handful have ever been recognized for their achievement.

However, all too often, women in Western society view midlife as the beginning of the end. This, maintains Dr. Karen Kaigler-Walker, is tragic, for when women equate self-worth with socially dictated standards of youthful attractiveness, they run the risk of failing to fully develop their true selves. In Positive Aging, Dr. Kaigler-Walker illuminates the quest women must take to free themselves from this cultural trap to enjoy the fruits that aging can bring. Identifying the problem as essentially one of the spirit, she guides the reader in a step-by-step process to heal the wounds caused by such social standards. Through myths, fairy tales, and a series of practical exercises, the reader will learn to love herself and make conscious choices about her appearance - choices that reflect her midlife wisdom and inherent beauty.",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/40/9781573240840.jpg,Success,109,20.1

Ezekiel Murphy, a black West Indian immigrant, takes up a new job as an attendant in a large London lavatory. The supervisor, Josiah Reynolds, and another West Indian, Jason, explain to him that one of the main problems they face is the amount of casual sex that takes place in the cubicles. They are under pressure from the council authorities to reduce such behaviour and expect Ez to help them in 'cleaning out the swamp'. Each of the protagonists brings his own moral assumptions to the problem. Ez, a devout Adventist, is shocked by such revelations. Jason believes that this kind of sex occurs because 'Whitey' is inherently corrupt. Reynolds, having been warned by the council that their Gents has always had a bad reputation, takes a more pragmatic view of the problem and is concerned to prevent such sexual encounters in case the council attempts to close the establishment down. A determined campaign by the three attendants effectively reduces the furtive activity in the cubicles, but the turnstile takings also fall by forty percent. The council argues that, in view of the reduction in revenue, the urinal is no longer worth the cost of keeping it open. Ez, Reynolds and Jason, their future employment prospects in jeopardy, must take a fresh look at their job and themselves.                        <p>From the Booker-nominated author of The Rationalist comes a touching and brilliantly funny exploration of a clash of cultures and morals set in the underground world of a men's public urinal. 160 pp.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.44974301448 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/84/9780714530284.jpg,Success,84,20.1

Written by a Hollywood insider and based on interviews with more than 140 of Streisand's friends, family, lovers, associates, and enemies - many of whom go on the record for the first time - Streisand takes you on a revelatory journey from her Brooklyn beginnings to the controversies surrounding her latest movie, The Mirror Has Two Faces. In between, we come to know Barbra Streisand as never before. We enter her world of childhood angst, of unprecedented youthful ambition and glittering Broadway stardom at twenty-two. We learn what went into her extraordinary success as singer, screen actor, and director - and what went on in her tempestuous private life, from her first bruising teenage affair to her marriage to Elliott Gould and her romances with Omar Sharif, Jon Peters, Pierre Trudeau, Don Johnson, James Brolin, and others. We are given moving insight into her relationship with her only son, Jason, and her acceptance of his gay lifestyle; her complicated feelings toward her mother; her unusual and deeply felt connection to her goddaughter, Caleigh - the daughter she never had - and the lowdown on her high-profile political activism. Above all, we come to understand as never before the unique blend of talent, vulnerability, passion, and ambition that has made Barbra Streisand the enduring, fascinating star she is.

Full-color illustrations.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>``My mother and Bootsie Barker's mother are best friends,'' begins the diminutive narrator of this uproariously illustrated story. Bootsie stops short of actually biting, but she bares her teeth in a gleeful lethal grin as the daily mom-and-daughter visit begins. Wearing her broad-brimmed black hat and wickedly pointy hot-pink boots, Bootsie ignores all injunctions to ``play nicely, girls!'' She pretends to be a hungry dinosaur, tears up her timid host's book about turtles and knocks over an aquarium housing Charlene the salamander. Alas, the girls' parents are blind to Bootsie's malevolence and plan an overnight stay; the narrator, certain that she and Charlene will be ``rushed to the hospital with dinosaur bites,'' confides her fears to her mother, whose calm response plants the germ of an idea. The next day the beleaguered heroine thinks fast and gives Bootsie a witty comeuppance. Bottner ( Let Me Tell You Everything ) smoothly adopts the understandably anxious child's point of view, while Rathmann ( Ruby the Copycat ) contributes formidable, hyper-bright watercolors that echo the story's nightmarish but hilarious exaggeration.

But Jo Beth's life doesn't lend itself to leisure. Before the couple can leave for a picnic, a visitor arrives. Gilly Ainsley has a bizarre message for Jo Beth: a letter from Gilly's dead mother claiming that she was murdered by the man for whom she kept house - a superior court judge - and stating that Jo Beth would bring him to justice. Jo Beth has to rack her brain to remember Gilly's mother, whom she met once years before. But when it becomes clear that Gilly, too, is in danger, Jo Beth stops worrying and goes into action. Naturally Gilly will stay at the compound. Its security is first-rate due to the fact that Jo Beth's ex-husband, Bubba, a truly dangerous man with the reddest neck this side of the Mason-Dixon line, has been stalking her ever since his release from prison. It seems that Gilly's mother saw something she shouldn't have in the woods of the Okefenokee Swamp. But that place guards its secrets well, so finding out just what the judge is hiding there will have to wait. First a search-and-rescue call plunges Jo Beth, along with her best bloodhounds, into the dense, steaming, snake-and-gator-infested swamp looking for an abducted little boy. Then the town's first bank robbery in forty years gets everyone good and excited, especially a blind one-year-old bloodhound with long ears and a remarkable nose. And in the midst of it all, Jo Beth is devastated by a brutal reminder of just how hazardous it is to be her friend. Finally it is time for the judge. JoBeth knows that in a month of Sundays she'd never be able to nail His Honor for murder. But maybe, with a little luck and a lot of legwork, she'll uncover something of which he can be found guilty.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/97/9780061010897.jpg,Success,75,20.1

Public paranoia about the AIDS virus and its successors has led to the imprisonment of the &quot;subversives&quot; of the society (namely, drug users and gays) in forced labor quarantine camps known as quarries. Meanwhile, Earth itself is dying from a progressive lack of greenery, as the UV irradiation from a successively depleted ozone layer is killing off all the plants, and therefore the planet's ability to sustain itself. <P>To counteract this problem, the powers of Earth have decided that new greenery must be found on alternate worlds, to supplement Earth's dying stock with heartier, alien strains. But since faster-than-light travel is still unavailable, a new method must be found to achieve this. Enter time travel, in which a quick jaunt down through time can bring ships into the position of planets which had rotated through Earth's present position in the distant past, due to the galaxy's extended period of rotation.<P>As most people are unable to remain awake during these temporal Dives, the guiding duty is left to an exclusive class of Dive pilots. Only dive pilots have a limited span before they burn out. Most can last thirty to forty Dives. Clio Finn has lasted fifty-five, and she is on the ragged end of burn-out, kept on track only by a handful of outlawed drugs. <P>But the potential rewards are great. A previous haul of greenery, once thought to be Earth's salvation, is dying off, and an illicit jaunt into the future taken by Clio and her colleagues has discovered the violent end of humanity itself. So her current destination, Niang, an Edenic tropical planet, seems the answer to mankind's prayers. Only, on Niang's surface, Clio discovers a desperate secret. The green which may save mankind also subsists on metals, and may therefore destroy all of mankind's existing technology. Clio's dilemma&#151;whether to regreen Earth at the risk of driving man back into the dark ages&#151;is only exacerbated when an accidental loop in time catches her in a paradox between two alternate futures, each of which is determined to eradicate the other completely and absolutely.</p><h3>Pixel Planet</h3><p>The book works both as a cautionary tale and a SF adventure.

Lydian and Merle's careening love affair takes them from Paris to Jamaica, from the wrong side of the law to the far side of late-millennium family values, and ultimately, to a face-off between technology and civilization that spurs Lydian to question - and then dismantle - the very essence of human existence.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/37/9781878067937.jpg,Success,82,20.1

These twenty stories, each told from a mother's point of view, evoke every stage of the journey, from pregnancy and birth on through the childhood years, adolescence, and adulthood. Together, they depict the complexities of mothering in America today as women are actually experiencing it. The works gathered here by Perri Klass, Laurie Colwin, Mary Gordon, Sue Miller, and fifteen others constitute a step toward a new ""mothers"" literature that puts to rest the long-held myth that has separated motherhood from a woman's creative activity.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Transfiguring life into art, Barbara Kingsolver, Laurie Colwin, Mary Gordon, Sue Miller and Perri Klass are among the 20 writers, mothers all, who contribute stories-all previously published-to this well-chosen anthology about bearing or raising children. Editors Kenison (series editor for The Best American Short Stories) and Hirsch (Songs from the Alley) have chosen stories that illustrate ""the complexities of mothering in America today."" Klass's ""For Women Everywhere,"" spiked with humor, tells of a 35-year-old single woman, nine months pregnant, who refuses to identify her baby's father: ""I am not the kind to kiss and tell,"" she states. In Kate Braverman's disturbing ""Pagan Night,"" a young mother contemplates killing her unnamed, unwanted infant son. Meanwhile, Kingsolver's ""Quality Time"" limns a divorced mother, hurriedly dropping off her daughter at daycare before running errands and going to work, who reflects that ""Parenting is something that happens mostly while you're thinking of something else."" Several tales deal with losing a child; of these, Alice Elliott Dark's ""In the Gloaming,"" about a mother caring for her 33-year-old son dying of AIDS, is the most moving. Each entry is followed by a brief author's note on the story's genesis. In their thoughtful introduction, the editors express their wish that this group of tales may ""serve as a step toward a `mother's literature'""; it does, admirably.

In a work that recasts both the history of real property law and the history of the family, she finds that one of the principal and determinative features of upper-class real property inheritance was the exclusion of females. This exclusion was accomplished by a series of legal devices designed to nullify the common-law rules of inheritance under which—had they prevailed—40 percent of English land would have been inherited or held by women.</p>
<p>Current ideas of family development portray female inheritance as increasing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but Spring argues that this is a misperception, resulting from an incomplete consideration of the common-law rules. Female rights actually declined, reaching their nadir in the eighteenth century. Spring shows that there was a centuries-long conflict between male and female heirs, a conflict that has not been adequately recognized until now.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.743 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches",37.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/21/9780807846421.jpg,Success,113,20.1

As a result of analyzing the historical trajectory of storytelling and the literary fairy tale, the essays in <b></b><b><i>Happily Ever After</i></b> move from the sixteenth century to the present, between different cultures and societies, and from specific analyses to general syntheses. Zipes demonstrates how Straparola's 16th-century <i>Puss in Boots</i> tale is related to Disney's 1922 film version. He examines the narrative structure of <i>Hansel and Gretel</i> as a rationalization for child abuse, tracing the same theme in Collad's novel <i>Pinocchio</i> and its Disney film version. He concludes by examining how we have come full circle from the early oral tradition in light of the rise of storytelling throughout the world. Underscoring all these essays is the question that all fairy tales raise&#58; what does it take to bring about happiness? Is happiness only to be found in fairy tales?</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Zipes (German, Univ. of Minnesota), well known in storytelling and folklore circles for such works as Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion (Routledge, 1985), confronts in this series of essays the question much discussed recently on listservs: How have the relatively new media of film and television affected traditional storytelling and stories, particularly fairy tales? Zipes is concerned with the ""commodification"" of fairy tales, la Disney, where the films are designed more to sell a line of toys and other products than to present a story to an audience. Zipes traces the use of fairy tales in the acculturation process through various time periods, emphasizing the importance of being cognizant of the process itself. The beginning of an important discussion, his work is recommended for academic libraries and public libraries with substantial collections in either folklore or media studies.Katherine K.

Although Stein, Bishop, and Rich differ by generation, poetic style, and relationship to audience, all three are twentieth-century lesbian poets who struggle with the revelatory nature of language. All three, argues Dickie, use language to express and to conceal their experiences as they struggle with a censorship that was both culturally sanctioned and self-imposed. Dickie explores how each poet negotiates successfully and variously with the need for secrecy and the desire for openness.</p>
<p>By analyzing each poet's work in light of the shared themes of love, war, and place, Dickie makes visible a continuity of interests between these three rarely linked women.

Including women married and single, young and old, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual, the anthology covers historical development and changing mores through the seventeenth century, after the Restoration of Charles II, a time of relative freedom for women; the eighteenth century, when the cult of romantic friendship reached its peak; the nineteenth century, when women writers wrote about issues of same-sex desire indirectly and explored complex issues such as death in tones of weariness and resignation; and the twentieth century, when poets began to engage in more overt explorations of women's bodies, sensuality, and lovemaking. Emma Donoghue's introduction deftly guides readers into the rich tradition of women's poetry in English, exploring the relationships between poets and their muses and poets and their cultures. Poems Between Women is testimony not only to the recurring theme of the unique bonds among women but also to the universality of love, friendship, and creativity.                        <p>1998 Lambda Literary Awards, spirituality/religion category</p>",en,0,"Height: 8.56 Inches, Length: 5.81 Inches, Weight: 1.02 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/46/9780231109246.jpg,Success,114,20.1

Green's comprehensive analysis highlights the effects that factors such as class background, marital status, educational level, and attitudes about race and gender roles had in inspiring the region's women to work in favor of, or in opposition to, their own enfranchisement.</p>
<p>Green sketches the ranks of both movements—which included women and men, black and white—and identifies the ways in which issues of class, race, and gender determined the composition of each side. Coming from a wide array of beliefs and backgrounds, Green argues, southern women approached enfranchisement with an equally varied set of strategies and ideologies. Each camp defined and redefined itself in opposition to the other. But neither was entirely homogeneous: issues such as states' rights and the enfranchisement of black women were so divisive as to give rise to competing organizations within each group.

Scott Cardwell</h3><p><P>Shyam Selvadurai, a native Sri Lankan, weaves a spider web of a narrative in <i>Funny Boy</i>, a delicate yet potent first novel that concerns itself with love, politics, gender, race, sexuality and terrorism. While Selvadurai's gestures are grand, his execution is disarmingly modest. His narrator is Arjie Chelvaratnam, a Tamil boy from Columbo. Arjie's fresh, exuberant voice carries us along from idyllic Sundays when his ripe imagination wins him the honor of playing the main character in his female cousins' game called bride-bride -- by the transfiguration I saw taking place in Janaki's cracked full-length mirror ... I was able to ascend to another, more brilliant, more beautiful self -- to the hellish Sinhalese-Tamil riots of 1983, when he and his family sleep in their shoes so they can flee the fire and hate when it knocks at their door. <P>Although we follow young Arjie through almost a decade of his life and witness his awakening homosexuality, this book is, happily, much more than a coming-of age (and coming out) novel. Selvadurai's rich prose style, gently spiced with humor, captures the political as well as the personal in Arjie's world. Whether crowning an upstart cousin Her Fatness or jeering the regime -- they have witnesses for everything these days -- self-indulgence never tiptoes in. All this is contained in a series of six chapters, each a complete episode in Arjie's life. But clearly, the only reason any of this works is Selvadurai's shrewd storytelling -- he creates stories fat with all the good stuff: characters, plot and action. <i>Funny Boy</i> is a very promising debut. -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.999984 Inches, Length: 5.3125878 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.7499985 Inches",10.29,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/05/9780156005005.jpg,Success,86,20.1

Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide.</p>
<p>Then out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.</p>

And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be...</p>

Diverse peoples held together by respect for each other and the prospect of swift punishment if their laws were disobeyed. Fertile land that embraced a variety of climates and seasons. Angels to guard the mortals, and mystics to guard the forbidden knowledge. Jehovah to watch over them all... Generations later, the armed space cruiser Jehovah still looms over the planet Samaria, programmed to unleash its arsenal if peace is not sustained. But an age of corruption has come to the land, threatening that peace and placing the Samarians in grave danger. Their only hope lies in the crowning of a new Archangel. The oracles have chosen for this honor the angel named Gabriel, and further decreed that he must first wed a mortal woman named Rachel. It is his destiny and hers. And Gabriel is certain that she will greet the news of her betrothal with enthusiasm, and a devotion to duty equal to his own. Rachel, however, has other ideas...</p><h3>BookList</h3><p>Next in line to become archangel in the angel-led dominion of Samaria, Gabriel must lead the next chorale praising the god Jovah, which means he needs a wife--fast--to sing beside him. Guided by the local oracle and the light emanating from the Kiss of the Gods (a homing device in his wrist), he finds his Jovah-selected fiancee in a common Edori slave girl named Rachel. The marriage proves, however, anything but romantic. Far from rejoicing in the sudden freedom that her marriage brings, Rachel quickly becomes a thorn in Gabriel's side, using her newfound influence to help her downtrodden Edori brethren. Displaying sure command of characterization and vividly imagined settings, Shinn absorbs us in the story of how Rachel and Gabriel eventually unite in true love and respect. With place-names such as Gaza and Jordana, she tantalizingly hints at her Samaria's connection to an ancient Israeli past, and she tempers the angelic milieu with talk of her angels' technological heritage in an entertaining sf-fantasy blend that should please fans of both genres.</p>",en,Reissue,"Height: 6.7 Inches, Length: 4.24 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 1.02 Inches",8.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/24/9780441004324.jpg,Success,79,20.1

Shockingly graphic, yet delicately structured, A Parisian from Kansas folds back in upon itself as Darren visits his farmer parents in Kansas, meets lovers, and dies several times as the action accelerates toward a tragic but life-affirming finale.

Her friends get away - she is incarcerated. Twenty years later, she has a small, unfurnished flat in New York, a fridge stocked only with the pills supplied by her social worker and an irresistible urge to slip away and live somewhere unencumbered by memories, names and all of her other false possessions. When she finally discovers that even her social worker is taking pills in an attempt to cope with life, Carol gathers a few essential belongings into her backpack and sets off to sleep rough on the city's streets again. Turning away from her dependence on drugs, Carol finds that memories, histories and responsibilities slowly return to her. <i>In the Slammer with Carol Smith</i> is a tough, hip novel by one of America's most outstanding living authors.

1-57322-584-3,The Cloister Walk,"Norris, Kathleen",Riverhead Books,385,4/1/1997,,Paperback,"<p>Why would a married woman with a thoroughly Protestant background and often more doubt than faith be drawn to the ancient practice of monasticism, to a community of celibate men whose days are centered around a rigid schedule of prayer, work, and scripture? This is the question that Kathleen Norris herself asks as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at a Benedictine monastery. Yet upon leaving the monastery, she began to feel herself transformed, and the daily events of her life on the Great Plains - from her morning walk to her going to sleep at night - gradually took on new meaning. She found that in the monastery, time slowed down, offering a new perspective on community, family, and even small-town life. By coming to understand the Benedictine practice of celibacy, she felt her own marriage enriched; through the communal reading aloud of the psalms every day, her notion of the ancient oral tradition of poetry came to life; and even the mundane task of laundry took on new meaning through the lens of Benedictine ritual. Writing with lyrical grace, Kathleen Norris here takes us through a liturgical year, as she experienced it both within the monastery and outside it. She shows us, from the rare perspective of someone who is both insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world - its liturgy, its rituals, its sense of community - can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. Through her masterly prose and rare insight, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>The allure of the monastic life baffles most lay people, but in her second book Norris (Dakota) goes far in explaining it. The author, raised Protestant, has been a Benedictine oblate, or lay associate, for 10 years, and has lived at a Benedictine monastery in Minnesota for two. Here, she compresses these years of experience into the diary of one liturgical year, offering observations on subjects ranging from celibacy to dealing with emotions to Christmas music. Like the liturgy she loves, this meandering, often repetitive book is perhaps best approached through the lectio divina practiced by the Benedictines, in which one tries to ""surrender to whatever word or phrase captures the attention."" There is a certain nervous facility to some of Norris's jabs at academics, and she is sometimes sanctimonious. But there is no doubting her conviction, exemplified in her defense of the much-maligned Catholic ""virgin martyrs,"" whose relevance and heroism she wants to redeem for feminists. What emerges, finally, is an affecting portrait-one of the most vibrant since Merton's-of the misunderstood, often invisible world of monastics, as seen by a restless, generous intelligence.

Previous histories have rarely recognized that the battle for independence was also a woman's war. The ""women of the army"" toiled in army hospitals, kitchens, and laundries. Civilian women were spies, fund raisers, innkeepers, suppliers of food and clothing. Recruiters, whether patriot or tory, found men more willing to join the army when their wives and daughters could be counted on to keep the farms in operation and to resist enchroachment from squatters. ""I have Don as much to Carrey on the warr as maney that Sett Now at the healm of government,"" wrote one impoverished woman, and she was right.</p>
<p><i>Women of the Republic</i> is the result of a seven-year search for women's diaries, letters, and legal records. Achieving a remarkable comprehensiveness, it describes women's participation in the war, evaluates changes in their education in the late eighteenth century, describes the novels and histories women read and wrote, and analyzes their status in law and society. The rhetoric of the Revolution, full of insistence on rights and freedom in opposition to dictatorial masters, posed questions about the position of women in marriage as well as in the polity, but few of the implications of this rhetoric were recognized. How much liberty and equality for women? How much pursuit of happiness? How much justice?</p>
<p>When American political theory failed to define a program for the participation of women in the public arena, women themselves had to develop an ideology of female patriotism. They promoted the notion that women could guarantee the continuting health of the republic by nurturing public-spirited sons and husbands. This limited ideology of ""Republican Motherhood"" is a measure of the political and social conservatism of the Revolution. The subsequent history of women in America is the story of women's efforts to accomplish for themselves what the Revolution did not.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.04058187664 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",39.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/22/9780807846322.jpg,Success,113,20.1

It is Milagros, most of all, who schools Emilia in the way of the world, the art of politics, and the wars of the heart. Emilia's heart is captured early on by her childhood playmate Daniel Cuenca - Milagros's godson and the son of a gentlemanly doctor whose weekly salons provide genteel covers for Puebla's activists and intellectuals. As his country is drawn into a civil war, Daniel heeds the call of his party and takes off after whomever he believes the most promising leader of the moment, beginning a series of brutal partings and passionate reunions that leave Emilia feeling abandoned, angry, and in spite of herself, ever more ardent. Emilia discovers her own gift for healing and pursues the study of medicine, learning the mysterious science of herbs in her father's apothecary, apprenticing with Dr. Cuenca, and later, traveling north to Chicago to receive her formal training. It is during one of Daniel's prolonged absences that Emilia meets Antonio Zavalza, a physician who returns to Puebla to open a small hospital with his inherited wealth. Working side by side, Emilia and Dr. Zavalza fall in love, to no one's surprise, as Zavalza has been smitten with Emilia since he first heard the sound of her voice and has been a patient and steadfast suito

Thousands are herded onto slave ships headed for the intergalactic auction block.<P>Kris Bjornsen is captured in Denver on her way to her college classes and wakes up on the primitive planet Barevi. Courageous and resourceful, she manages a single-woman escape from the Catteni and is living in the wilds of the planet when she comes to the aid of a Catteni soldier pursued by his own ranks. Recaptured together, they join forces with other slaves to outwit their captors and a hostile planetary environment.<P>Listeners will delight in this ""against-the-odds"" story of survival, ingenuity and romance. As her audience has come to expect of McCaffrey, she delivers a rich and intricate science fiction adventure in Freedom's Landing, sure to win over even more listeners and add to her legions of fans.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In Freedom's Landing (1995), a group of plucky slaves, both human and alien, were abandoned by their Catteni masters on the planet Botany. With the help of the Catteni rebel Zainal, the colonists survived their early days, and now they're making plans to get even with the Catteni as well as to learn the truth about the mysterious Farmers, or Mech Makers, who seem to be cultivating Botany by means of robots. Told mostly from the point of view of Zainal's human lover, Kris Bjornsen, the plot focuses on the colonists' struggle to survive independent of their Catteni overlords. Though a few settlers want to return to Earth to fight the Catteni, most of the women seem bent on having children and making a real go of the colony. While this wholesale enthusiasm to procreate stretches credulity, McCaffrey's characters are otherwise her usual well-tempered mix of heroes, rogues and out-and-out villains. The setting is crisp and expertly detailed and the plot spins out smoothly, with more than enough hints of future developments to keep readers eager for the next installment in the series.

""Identity politics"", often formulated in terms of social reconstructionism or multiculturalism, has increasingly suppressed materialist feminism's systematic perspective, replacing it with discourse analysis or cultural politics. <b></b><b><i>Materialist Feminism&#58; A Reader</i></b> argues against the retreat to multiculturalism for keeping invisible the material links among the explosion of meaning-making practices in highly industrialized social sectors, the exploitation of women's labor, and the appropriation of women's bodies that continues to undergird the scramble for profits and state power in multinational capitalism. In making twenty years of materialist feminist thought more accessible, the <b></b><b><i>Reader</i></b> will contribute to the development of feminism's Third Wave. <b>Contributors include</b>&#58; Charlotte Bunch, Catherine MacKinnon, Ann Ferguson, Gayle Rubin, and Dorothy Smith.</p>",en,1,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.01 Inches, Weight: 1.74826573766 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",42.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/49/9780415916349.jpg,Success,132,20.1
