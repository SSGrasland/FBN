ABA/BEA ’97

By Carol Seajay
Something shifted at ABA/BEA this
year. I think it was the seat of power. Faced
with the prospect of a show without Big
Publishers, booksellers were supposed to
abandon the show and stay away in droves,
but instead they showed up and did busi-

support the show. The mid-sized “big guys”

convention, and the straw vote taken during ABA's
town meeting (about 80% of the assembly raised their
hands when asked if they thought booksellers would
be better served if the show went back to moving
around the country) will convince BEA officials to get
the show back on the road ASAP rather than waiting
for contracts to expire.
That one change would do more for the show
than all the ads that BEA ran, all the money that ABA
donated to travel-scholarships for bookstores, and it
would bring in enough “new” booksellers to make it
worth exhibiting at the show every year.
Was 1t a successful show for exhibitors?
The show was definitely a success for exhibitors
who were located in the front of the hall. Maybe even
for PGW, Consortium, and PMA publishers (all of
whom garnered front-and-center locations this year).
The “second string publishers,” who were the center
of attention in the absence of the majors, generally
reported being thrilled with the show. But if there
were islands of activity, there were also large black
holes that saw relatively few customers, insignificant
sales, and little walk-by traffic.
Statistics for the various categories of book buy-
ers have not yet been released. The general consensus
BEA incurred the fury of booksellers for selling
the highly visible aisle sign ads to Amazon.com. BEA
apologized at the Town Meeting.

chainstore participation was up, and that booksellers
in general were down somewhat from last year.
The Gay/Lesbian! Feminist Asl
And traffic on The Aisle? BEA gave us our worst
location in ten years, at the absolute far end of the
show. The Aisle was strictly destination shopping —
part of a 4-5 row wide peninsula of booths with
nothing beyond it to draw traffic through. There was
an empty booksellers lounge on one side and more,
mostly empty, tables on the other side. The promised
restaurant at the end of The Aisle never materialized
and there were relatively few publisher booths on
either side of The Aisle to draw non-destination traf-
fic. Last year’s excellent overhead signage was
nowhere to be seen — instead it was replaced with
“street sign” type signs that identified The Aisle (and
other special sections) to anyone who was standing in
front of them, but did nothing to help booksellers find
the aisle if they weren’t already there.
Just to add insult to injury, there was a huge pillar
(about 10' x 10) smack in the center of The Aisle, which
effectively destroyed any visual unity that the aisle
may otherwise have had.
At the top of The Aisle, and the recipient of one
of the two “street signs” BEA coughed up to identify
it, was Login’s relatively massive and elegant booth,
which was not particularly gay/lesbian or feminist

22nd ANNUAL EDITION! ® e © ©
This easily read, yet informative and scholarly calendar is perfect for both the beginner and the
seasoned moon-lover. The ‘98 edition features fresh work from 23 artists, poets, and writers, full
astronomical and astrological data, the lunar year-at-a-glance, complete instructions, and an excellent

Robert Graves. Each of the 13 lunations (lunar months) is depicted in a unique spiral format, showing
all the moon’s phases, rise and set times, apogee and perigee, the transits of the zodiac, void-of-course
times, earth festivals, and visibility of the morning and evening stars.
“Extremely well produced...”
-THE LOS ANGELES TIMES
“...the most beautiful calendar I have ever seen...”
- Marge Piercy, THE MOON IS ALWAYS FEMALE
“As always, the artwork for each lunar month, the poetry and the text are moving and profound...you
owe it to yourself to get the THE LUNAR CALENDAR.” -THE UNICORN

Tit Test Time, by GIRLilla graFACTS, is a quality
laminated card that hangs in the shower and provides
thorough instructions, using upbeat language, and
images of up-to-date breast self-exam techniques. With
English on one side, Spanish on the other, and photo-
graphs of women of diverse sizes, races and ages, these
cards speak directly to an issue facing all women today.
In the midst of a breast cancer epidemic, women need
positive reminders to help us know and care for our
breasts. Tit Test Time helps break through the common
fear and procrastination surrounding breast self-
examination. “Tit Test Time has inspired me to do
something I was afraid to do.” GIRLilla graFACTS is
run by two women who are grassroots activists and
artists. Cards (81⁄2"" x 11"") are $33.50 /each, depending
on quantity. Please call or write us: 206-726-8938, 1436

Rachel Whiteread: Shedding Life, intro by
Fiona Bradley, texts by Rosalind Krauss, Bartomeu
Marí, Stuart Morgan, and Michael Tarantino, fea-
tures the work of one of the younger, more hotly

London in 1963, casts familiar objects in plaster,
resin or rubber. This includes objects as small as a hot
water bottle and as large as a Victorian house, cast
solid from the inside out. There is evocative drama
in the story and pictures of the cast house, the sup-
port for and outcry against it, and it’s demolition.
