passions that are the slightest bit odd, perhaps even deviant. Each
waitress has a silent desire burning her heart. Once or twice, a
smouldering secret sparks and lights into something unexplained, a
switch to the supernatural.
Against a working-class midwestern background emerges a quirky and
loveable cast of characters. Charming as Fried Green Tomatoes, Switch
celebrates the variety and dignity of human desire and the sensuality of
everyday life.

Everywoman’s Almanac 1999
The Best of the Everywoman’s Almanac
With Women’s Press’ 25-year history of inspiring feminist publishing and the advent
of a new century, the 7999 Fverywoman’s Almanac spotlights the most intriguing
interviews that have been featured in this original women’s datebook.
Since its birth in 1976, the almanac has explored sex and sexuality, the politics of
women’s health, friendship, women in their workplaces — paid or unpaid — the
impact of feminism on women’s lives, women in times of economic crisis, reproduc-
tive choice, anti-nuclear and anti-poverty movements, and food issues.

The Queen’s New Shoes
Adwoa A. Badoe Illustrated by Belinda Ageda
The author and illustrator of Crabs for Dinner, Adwoa A. Badoe and Belinda Ageda,
have created another enchanting picture book for children. 70e Queen's New Shoes
introduces us to Esmeralda, the formidable queen of Istanbul, and her closet full of two
thousand four hundred and forty-eight pairs of shoes — not including the pair on her
feet, which totals two thousand four hundred and forty-nine pairs in all!
The Queen's New Shoes teaches us thoughtful lessons on greed and arrogance, and
offers us a wonderful tale of learning and sharing.

The New York Times
Set in present-day suburban Minneapolis, the film centers on
three recent high school graduates and their families. Greg, a
handsome, confident young man to whom people always gravitate,
has landed a job at a top magazine. Chloe, his sister, is pursuing a
career as a model. Rebecca, who is painfully shy, has an encounter
with Denise that blossoms into love. And Evelyn, a widow, the
neighborhood libertine has an affair with Greg. As the young
protagonists wrestle with the coming of adulthood, their parents are
forced to step back, examine their own choices and come to terms
with where they are in life. Woven together, their stories unite to
become a meditation on finding one’s place in the world — leaving

WORK
A Film By RACHEAL REICHMAN
Set against the gritty backdrop of a small Missouri milltown, Rachel
Reichman’s feature film WORK tells the tale of Jenny, an unem-
ployed housewife in her mid twenties, as she looks for a job and
yearns for passion. Jenny divides her days between the search for
work and her deepening love affair with the young black athlete,
June, who lives next door. She spends her nights listening to talk
about the mill and the escalating violence among the workers.
As Jenny's search for work becomes more desperate, her desire
for June grows. June wins a college scholarship out of state; as the
summer draws to an end, so does Jenny and June's affair.
Passion isn't always enough; sometimes forces beyond our control
narrow our choices no matter how powerful our desires. WORK
propels Reichman into the ranks of today’s most provocative
independent directors, such as award-winning filmmakers John
Sayles (Lianna) and Lizzie Borden (Born in Flames).
Lesbian and gay personnel on WORK included actors Cynthia
Kaplan (Jenny) and Sonja Sohn (June), composer Eve Beglarian,
and cinematographer Steven Giuliano.
