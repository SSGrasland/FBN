Propelled out of 1905 Russia by a pogrom in which she loses her first child, her twin brother, and her father, Sarah Solomon arrives in an America of bowler hats, Irish cops, elevated subway cars, Jewish and Italian anarchists, and labor ferment. Establishing herself as an artist, Sarah lives with and loves two very different men: a landsman, Lev Levitsky, and Sim Coppley, a proper New York WASP who is in love with all things Jewish, including her. While Sarah and Lev embark on an artistic life together that will take them west to a newly established Hollywood, their wild, flapper daughter and avant-garde writer, Salome, cavorts in 1929 Paris with the likes of Henry Miller, Anais Nin, and Gertrude Stein, until she learns a shocking secret that compels her to search for her WASP roots. Salome's daughter, Sally, destined to become one of the 1960's most famous folksingers, is struck like lightning by fame, and with it the ravages of a counterculture that wreaked havoc upon the lives of so many young artists. We meet Sally - and all of these women - through her daughter, Sara. Born in 1978, trained as an historian and in the process of researching her family history at the prestigious Council on Jewish History in New York, Sara finds herself drawn into the tumultuous lives of her ancestors via a sepia-tone photograph of her great-grandmother Sarah, for whom she was named. A single mother with a young daughter, Sara absorbs all she can of the strength of her great-grandmother and grandmother, and tries to make peace with the ghost of her own neglectful mother; she comes to understand the paradoxical, subjective nature of memory, and the way we invent, reinvent, and assimilate our ancestors. With Inventing Memory, Erica Jong has written the saga of four generations o",en,,"Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",6.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/03/9780061091803.jpg,Success,171,21.1

The Language of Fertility challenges the traditionally held view that problems with fertility are due to purely a medical condition to be treated with drugs and surgery. Niravi Payne explains how affected and men's bodies and minds can be so affected by generations of their family's beliefs and patterns of behavior that their natural fertility and ability to conceive can be blocked. Her unique techniques of self-analysis help women, men, and couples become conscious about how they need to change their minds and their lives to reclaim their natural fertility and conceive and give birth to a baby. Her methods are helpful at any time - whether used while undergoing medical reproductive treatments, between treatments, or independent of any medical treatment. In the Whole Person Fertility Program, Payne leads readers through the same exercises, family tree mappings, meditations, visualizations, and journal-writing that have helped her clients break through the emotional barriers to conception and have led them to heal their whole lives - whether or not pregnancy occurs. And she tells dozens of inspiring and compelling case studies from her own practice, in which her clients have healed their relationships to their spouses, siblings, and other family members, and as a direct result have been able to conceive.

Norma Field, the daughter of a Japanese woman and an American G.I., and author of the acclaimed <i><br>
In the Realm of a Dying Emperor</i>, returned to Japan in 1995 to tend to her slowly dying grandmother, who had been rendered speechless by multiple strokes. What she finds—both in the memories of her childhood in her grandmother's household and in the altered face of postmodern Japan—forms the substance of her narrative that transcends both memoir and essay to reveal, through crafted fragments, a refraction of the whole of Japan.<br>
Having spent her childhood in Japan and her adulthood in the United States, Field speaks from the position of one who straddles two worlds. Her testimony is highly personal, her voice is intimate, her observations are keen and clear. She juxtaposes details from daily life—conversations overheard on the subway; arguments between her mother and aunts; the struggle to feed, bathe, and care for her grandmother—with observations on the political and social changes that have transformed Japan. She shows how the belated coming to terms with the war and continuing avoidance of the same are intimately related to the look and feel of Japanese society today. She gently folds back the complicated layers of blame and responsibility for the war, touching in the process on subjects as diverse as the effects of the atomic bomb, comfort women, biracial/bicultural families, the farewells of Kamikaze pilots, and the dehumanizing effects of Japan's postwar economic boom. A recurrent theme is the observation of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the war.<br>
<i>From My Grandmother's Bedside</i> is also a contemplation of the many facets of language: the kinds of language with which her grandmother's illness has been negotiated, the wordless language her grandmother speaks, her own relationship to these languages.

Examining the changing meaning of 'place' in women's lives over time and across space, this book questions how women face, negotiate and shape the social space of their environment. Engaging personal narratives are presented by fifteen women of various age groups, from different cultural, religious, social and geographical backgrounds, from Mexican politician, Muslim psychiatrist, Finnish housewife to Indian guru and African rural woman. Writing about the lives of their grandmothers, mothers, themselves, their daughters or other close female relatives, the authors of these life narratives cross generational and cultural divides and share perceptions with each other. This unique inter-generational approach provides an engaging challenge to the generalised assumptions of how women in various historical and cultural contexts feel about womanhood, life, society, culture and religion.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/79/9780415171779.jpg,Success,182,21.1

Rigoberta Menchu is a worldwide symbol of courage in the continuing fight of indigenous peoples for justice. The Guatemalan Indian leader first came to the world's attention with the publication of her autobiography ""I, Rigoberta Menchu"" in 1984. The book chronicled the terrible hardship of her childhood in Guatemala, including the murder of her brother, father and mother at the hands of a ruthless military. But it also captured the dignity of Indian daily life in a cadence that was beautifully simple. ""I, Rigoberta Menchu"" has become an international bestseller with one million copies in print. In ""Crossing Borders,"" Menchu picks up her story where the first volume left off. In 1981 she fled from Guatemala to Mexico City, deeply traumatized by the violence against her family and community. She resolved to dedicate her life to the Indian cause and painstakingly built a solidarity movement with the Indians living as outlaws in Guatemala's mountains. In 1988 she returned to Guatemala as a representative of the opposition in exile. She was immediately arrested and was released only after an international outcry. Danielle Mitterand and Desmond Tutu were amongst the leading names in an international campaign to secure the Nobel Peace Prize for Menchu which she was awarded in 1992. The long haul to build effective representation for indigenous peoples has taken Menchu around the world and its telling is a thread throughout this book. But ""Crossing Borders"" is more than an account of a political campaign. In these pages Menchu also talks with deep affection about her mother and the traditions of her Mayan background. In her introduction to ""I, Rigoberta Menchu"" the ethnologist Elizabeth Burgos Debray writes: 'Her voice is so heart-rendingly beautiful because it speaks to us of every facet of the life of a people and their oppressed culture. Her story is overwhelming because what she has to say is simple and true'. In ""Crossing Borders"" that story continues to enchant and inspire.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.28088574222 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/37/9781859848937.jpg,Success,185,21.1

With over sixty illustrations it serves to introduce the current landscape of Asian and Asian American Art, with essays on art in China, Taiwan and North America, as well as individual essays on leading artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, Xu Bing and Michael Joo. Above all, Yang explores the challenges that contemporary Asian and Asian American art poses to artists, critics, curators and viewers alike. In particular, she reflects on the complexities of exhibition practice, the role of identity politics in arts, the unspoken assumptions of Western critics faced with Asian art, and the difficulties faced by artists working between cultures.

<p>Although the women's movement initiated public discussion of wife abuse, the fight against abuse is now conducted primarily by the state through its allocation of resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student Body is the smartest, sexiest beach book of the year, written by four Harvard graduates who are as diverse as their characters.<br>
<br>
Harvard University can be a menacing place. Academic pressure is intense. Attitude reigns. Racial and sexual politics create a minefield. Toni Isaacs, a gutsy young Harvard student who reports for the campus paper, can handle that—usually. This smart black woman works hard, knows how to dress, and won't back down in a fight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covering a story for the Harvard Crimson, Toni receives a tip: Harvard students—both men and women—are working as prostitutes. Determined to make her mark, Toni finds herself drawn into Boston's sexual underworld, where she encounters strippers, johns, escorts, vice cops, a stash of student sex diaries, and an MBA candidate with a very unusual business plan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toni's investigation ineluctably draws in some of her closest friends, who find their own worlds spinning out of control. This Mod Squad for the nineties stumbles across a scheme that jeopardizes much more than their academic futures and will have readers of this compulsive page-turner wondering just who the real prostitutes at Harvard are.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with unforgettable characters, mordant wit, and steamy details, The Student Body is written with the sly intelligence and authenticity that only true Harvard graduates can provide.

What would it take to ensure that all of us can succeed at getting the job done, the problem solved, and the future more secure?</i> <P>As a student at Yale Law School in 1974, Lani Guinier attended a class with a white male professor who addressed all the students, male and female, as gentlemen. To him the greeting was a form of honorific, evoking the values of traditional legal education. To her it was profoundly alienating.<P>Years later Guinier began a study of female law students with her colleagues, Michelle Fine and Jane Balin, to try to understand the frustrations of women law students in male-dominated schools. Women are now entering law schools in large numbers, but too often many still do not feel welcome. As one says, I used to be very driven, competitive. Then I started to realize that all my effort was getting me nowhere. I just stopped caring. I am scarred forever. <P>After interviewing hundreds of women with similar stories, the authors conclude that conventional one-size-fits-all approaches to legal education discourage many women who could otherwise succeed and, even more, fail to help all students realize their full potential as legal problem-solvers.<P>In <i>Becoming Gentlemen</i> Guinier, Fine, and Balin dare us to question what it means to become qualified, what a fair goal in education might be, and what we can learn from the experience of women law students about teaching and evaluating students in general. Including the authors' original study and two essays and a personal afterword by Lani Guinier, the book challenges us to work toward a more just society, based on ideals of cooperation, the resources of diversity, and the values of teamwork.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Guinier argues here against what she calls one-size-fits-all legal education, which, given the lead author (Guinier is a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Clinton's one-time nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights) and the subject, should be interesting. Unfortunately, this is a lightly padded study conducted by the authors along with law students Ann Bartow and Deborah Lee Stachel. By analyzing the responses of 366 first-, second- and third-year U. of Pennsylvania law students (fairly evenly divided between genders), the authors argue that standardized tests may not identify who will become a good lawyer; that treating all students the same is not necessarily treating them all fairly; and that the present program of standardized tests and Socratic classroom instruction may not be what is best suited to the future needs of the legal profession, which may benefit more from teamwork and cooperation. This last point warranted a stronger argument to bolster the authors' call for less aggressive instruction. The survey results, too, would have been more persuasive had objective observation been added to the students' self-reporting and if the questionnaire had been applied to other law schoolsparticularly since the authors note that the relatively gender-neutral findings of a Stanford survey may be attributable to the distinctive environment of Stanford. The converted may overlook some of these weaknesses, while the skeptical will be made more so by remarks from both students (I really resent feeling like after I am laying out all of this money... I should be forced to participate) and authors (law schools fail to equalize the experience and outcomes for all law students across gender).

<p>Andrea Ashworth, at age twenty-eight one of the youngest fellows at Oxford University, is a young woman of remarkable charm, poise, and intelligence. Her path to her present life, however, has been far from conventional, and in this striking memoir, written with courage and delicacy, she shares a story that makes her achievements all the more astonishing. Although she only vaguely remembers her father, Andrea quickly becomes aware that the dark skin she inherited from him sets her apart from her English mother and the series of stepfathers who soon enter her life. What follows is a vivid and unforgettable portrait of a family terrorized by the explosive rage of one stepfather and then another, and of a sensitive and observant child, caught in a remorseless cycle of poverty and brutality, who refuses to give into despair. For in the midst of her misery, Andrea discovers a haven in the work of writers such as Joyce and Eliot, who allow her to see a world beyond her own and set her on the path toward intellectual and artistic awakening. A portrait of the artist as a young woman, Once in a House on Fire records a life blighted by violence, then redeemed by art.</p>",en,1st American ed,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/21/9780805057621.jpg,Success,172,21.1

Now Stephanie Bender, an expert in women's hormonal health, sounds a wake-up call for the confusing years before menopause, which require special emotional, dietary, and health guidance.
<p><b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explains how symptoms such as irregular cycles, night sweats and insomnia, decreased libido, memory lapses, and mood swings can be traced to fluctuating hormones. It gives detailed recommendations on how to use both conventional and alternative approaches to lessen symptoms, including the most up-to-date research and new treatments. Bender also goes beyond medical advice to show women how all facets of their lives, from diet to attitude to lifestyle, can be transformed to make this an exciting and productive phase. Perimenopause is a time when women can reconsider their beliefs and priorities with newfound wisdom--perhaps discarding outmoded images of female beauty and examining their relationships with lovers and family on a deeper level. <b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explores this neglected age with practical ways to enhance the quality of all areas of women's lives.</p>

Bold in its historical scope, rich in colorful settings, and eminently readable, <i>Confessions of Madame Psyche</i> also reaches inward, toward quieter truths.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel is narrated by Mei0li Murrow, born in San Francisco in 1895, the illegitimate daughter of a charismatic confidence man and the Chinese prostitute he has rescued from the streets. After her mother's early death, Mei-li is left to care of her mercenary half-sister Erika. When the young Mei-li, by pure coincidence, predicts the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, Erika contructs her identity as Madame Psyche-exploiting Mei'li's exoticism and her clients' yearnings for contact with the dead in a series of ingeniously orchestrated seances that win her renown as a medium in California and then in the death-soaked Europe of the First World War.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, it is when she manages to finally reject the popular spirituality that has made her famous that Mei-li experiences a truer spiritual vision: One day, while walking on the beach, she has a revelation of her connection to all of life-an experience of hidden reality which I have never doubted...and which left me permanently changed by what I then knew and know still and will always know.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei-li's subsequent journey leads her through the aspirations and disappointments of a utopian commune in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the 1920s; to the poverty of migrant work camps in the Depression-era Salinas Valley; and to the courage of the first strikes on San Jose's cannery row. Finally, when the relentless Erika cheats her out of an inheritance by having her committed to the Napa State Hospital, Mee-li finds her greatest wisdom and peace among the outcasts of the asylum-and there writes her confessions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei'li's story is ensconed in the rich history of Northern California in the first half of the twentieth century, and peopled by comrades of many classes and cultures and lovers both male and female; but her central odyssey remains one of inner discovery. In Confessions of Madame Psyche, Dorothy Bryant has created a character who is so honest in her search for truth, growth, and spiritual understanding that this quest becomes inherent to her survival.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.06042348022 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/63/9781558611863.jpg,Success,107,21.1

Broadsides, newspapers, and books depicted their stories in gruesome detail, often with illustrations of the crime scene, the courtroom proceedings, and the execution. This sensational coverage fed the public appetite for stories of female deviancy and punishment.</p>
<p>Judith Knelman contends that the portrayal of murder by women was linked to a broader public agenda, set and controlled by men. Women were expected to be devoted to giving and sustaining life. Aggression was ""masculine."" Thus a woman who killed posed a threat to patriarchal authority.</p>
<p>Knelman describes the range and incidence of murder by women in England. She analyses case histories of different kinds of murder, and explores how press representations of the murderess contributed to the Victorian construction of femininity. She also suggests that class and gender discrimination pushed women to kill.</p>

How does surgery alter a woman's self-image? How do they face the possibility of debilitating autoimmune disease from rupturing or leaking implants? Now, having faced years of medical and personal uncertainty, many have coped by reassessing their lives and their relationships, by sharing information and support with other women with implants, outreach that becomes a means for self-empowerment.

Lupe is instantly drawn to Luis, who appears to be more interested in his family's honor than in the money that is rightfully his. She finds that she can't push him from her mind - brought up by a once aristocratic mother whose husband died in Castro's prison, he is the sort of man she might have ended up with had her family not succeeded in leaving Cuba in the first wave of immigration in the 1960s.

Valerie Grant examines evidence that women who score highly on personality questionnaires designed to measure dominance are more likely than less dominant women to conceive sons.<p>Dominance is a core personality trait whose biological basis is testosterone. Grant argues that the action of this hormone within the reproductive system leads to the favoring of sperm carrying male or female chromosomes. Thus the mother bears the gender that she is most suited to raise. She explains how these findings are compatible with contemporary research in reproductive physiology, evolutionary biology and developmental psychology and shows how the maternal dominance hypothesis makes sense of puzzling findings in demography, including the fact that more boys are born following war.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.50392 Inches, Length: 5.43306 Inches, Weight: 0.9479877266 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches",29.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/00/9780415158800.jpg,Success,182,21.1

Her last major work, written in response to episcopal criticism of worldliness, is a defense of her rights as an intellectual in the church. This book explores Sor Juana's life and work as a contribution to Latin American theology. Kirk also looks at Sor Juana's position as a strong-willed woman writing in an age when to have a feminist voice and use it was scandalous; and she contrasts this with the fact that Sor Juana's writing was, at least initially, supported and encouraged by those in power.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",8.4,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/36/9780826410436.jpg,Success,141,21.1

Going beyond previous studies, <i>Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder</i> focuses upon Wilder&rsquo;s years in Missouri from 1894 to 1957. Utilizing her unpublished autobiography, letters, newspaper stories, and other documentary evidence, John E. Miller fills the gaps in Wilder&rsquo;s autobiographical novels and describes her sixty-three years of living in Mansfield, Missouri. As a result, the process of personal development that culminated in Wilder&rsquo;s writing of the novels that secured her reputation as one of America&rsquo;s most popular children&rsquo;s authors becomes evident.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>It takes Miller one-third of this fact-clogged biography to start showing Laura Ingalls Wilder as ""the woman behind the legend,"" but when he finally does, the picture is fascinating. Wilder, whose seven semiautobiographical 'Little House on the Prairie' books have been read by millions and inspired a television series, was a bossy wife, a penny-pincher who once protested her power company's rates by having her electricity shut off and a political right-winger. By far the most absorbing aspect of Miller's book is the story of Wilder's relationship with her only child. Rose Wilder Lane was a childless divorce and an established writer by the time her mother began writing novels at age 63, and she edited her mother's books and got her agent to handle them. Miller draws heavily on Lane's diaries and letters, which often contain diatribes against a mother she alternately loved and resented. But while Wilder left no personal papers presenting her side, Miller seems to paint a balanced portrait. He's not so balanced elsewhere, and in an effort to contextualize his subject, he often presents reams of redundant or unnecessary political, geographical and cultural details that bog down what is otherwise a very interesting story.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/75/9780826211675.jpg,Success,160,21.1

<p>The book examines discourse on women's work and attempts to regulate it; labour activism, including formal membership in unions and parties as well as women's auxiliaries and organizations such as the Women's Labor League; and women's militancy during the First World War and the troubled post-war period. The author argues that women helped mount an opposition to the inequalities inherent in industrial capitalism, but they also had to fight against the supporting role they were forced to play in the very movements to which they belonged.</p>
<p>Kealey explores what the left thought about women's participation in politics and left-wing organizations across the country and she also looks at the nature of that participation itself. The scope of her book puts it in the forefront of its field.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1574268755 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/85/9780802073785.jpg,Success,93,21.1

In the growth of early childhood, hormonal ups and downs, the possibility of childbearing, and growing older are powerful keys to unlocking a woman's potential. Those notorious temperature changes in menopause are not hot flashes, they're power surges, and A Woman's Book of Life traces the compelling biopsychospiritual reality of the move into authentic power at midlife. This is a book for any woman, of any generation. It allows the reader to look back and see the forgotten gifts of childhood, or to look ahead in celebration of what's to come. Whatever her age, no woman will be able to come away from this book without a greater appreciation for who women are, in their bodies, their emotions, their souls. Borysenko offers a rare chance to understand the gifts of being female and to celebrate the power of the feminine life cycle.

                        <p>""...explains the connection between emotions and physical states, teaching women how to cope with the physical changes each hormonal and life cycle brings.""

0-8262-1162-3,Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial (Volume 1),"Moulakis, Athanasios",University of Missouri,280,3/4/1998,,Hardcover,"<p><i>Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial</i> delivers what no other book on Weil has—a comprehensive study of her political thought. In this examination of the development of her thought, Athanasios Moulakis offers a philosophical understanding of politics that reaches beyond current affairs and ideological advocacy.</p>
<p>Simone Weil—philosopher, activist, mystic—unites a profound reflection on the human condition with a consistent and courageous existential and intellectual honesty manifest in the moving testimony of her life and her death. Moulakis examines Weil's political thought as an integral part of a lived philosophy, in which analysis and doctrine are inseparable from the articulation of an intensely personal, ultimately religious experience.</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to distinguish Weil's life from her thought, her writings cannot be understood properly without linking them to her life and character. By situating Weil's political thought within the context of the intellectual climate of her time, Moulakis connects it also to her epistemology, her cosmology, and her personal experience.</p>
<p><i>Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial</i> presents the unfolding of Weil's philosophical life against the backdrop of the political and social conditions of the last days of the Third French Republic, the Spanish Civil War, and the rise and clash of totalitarian ideologies. The ideological climate of the age—of which Weil herself was not quite free—was indeed the major ""obstacle"" in the struggle against which she fashioned her critical, intellectual, and moral tools.</p>
<p>Weil has been categorized a number of ways: as a saint and a near convert to Roman Catholicism, as a social critic, or as an analytic philosopher. Moulakis examines <i>all</i> aspects of Weil's thought in the indissoluble unity in which she lived them. This thorough investigation pursues the particular intellectual affiliations and the social and political experiential stimuli of Weil's work while simultaneously teasing out the timeless themes that her own timely analysis was intended to reveal.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.38 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/20/9780826211620.jpg,Success,160,21.1

The crime lab can tell her only that the newly unearthed skeletal remains belonged to a woman who was strangled to death somewhere between two and ten years ago--a conclusion that sends Merry sifting through old missing-persons files. But then a shocking piece of news changes everything.<br><br>The Massachusetts police have arrested a man they believe to be a serial killer. His five known victims were all women--all strangled. Is Merry's Nantucket skeleton the killer's first victim? And do the state cops have the right man? When the murderer strikes again, he'll draw Merry into a deadly cat and mouse game in which she's the final target....</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A dog that digs up a skeleton on a beach starts an investigation that reveals a series of homicides and adulterous liaisons in the latest cast for Nantucket Police Detective Meredith Folger (Death in Rough Water, 1995). In the process, Merry is caught in a jurisdictional squabble involving her department, state police and the FBI. Forensic psychiatrist Tucker Enright hopes to find a link to serial murders the state cops and FBI are jointly investigating. But the skeleton is that of Dr. Elizabeth Osborne, who vanished from Nantucket eight years earlier during an affair with sculptor Ian Markham, who also vanished. It was Markham's children and their dog, living on Nantucket with their embittered mother, Julia, who discovered the skeleton. Delving into the past, the earnest Merry instinctively suspects the dead woman's husband, Harvard law professor Jack Osborne. Then Enright links the shocking murder of a Nantucket schoolteacher, Roxanne Teasdale, to the serial killer. And the cases begin to mesh as it's learned that Roxanne was having an affair with Jack Osborne. Although Enright and FBI investigator Dana Stevens admonish Merry to distance herself from her work, her commitment to the victims is justified in a slam-bang finale that baits and switches the reader before identifying the real murderer.

You’ll also get a handle on the many future implications the drug may have in our society of scientists, legal officials, average citizens, and all-night partiers.
<p>Put simply, no other publication will so concisely and clearly help you synthesize the structural significance, legal controversy, and adverse reactions surrounding Ecstasy as The Love Drug. Overall, its thought-provoking and informative treatment of the topic will give you a balanced, impartial view of Ecstasy’s past and present-day history. And on the other hand, it may also act as a pivotal deterrent if you’re someone who has experimented with this sometimes quixotic mind-altering substance. Specifically, its indepth examination will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the complete synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), its patent, chemical configuration, and pharmacological action</li>
<li>see the connection of this chemical substance to its infamous, alluring moniker—Ecstasy</li>
<li>get an accurate synopsis of the full oral and written legal history of the drug</li>
<li>become familiar with the adverse reactions ascribed to Ecstasy use</li>
<li>understand the place of Ecstasy in the realm of psychotherapy</li>
<li>see how Ecstasy and the Rave movement perpetuate each other
<p>If you’re one of the many who have made all-night partying a science, The Love Drug will clear away the dogma and show you the many ways this drug could change your life. If you’re a preclinical researcher, educator, or member of an emergency room team, you’ll find this book a priceless source of contemporary information.</p>

How often do politicians come out forthrightly in support of gay rights? Drawing on more than three hundred interviews with activists, politicians, officials, legislative aides, and journalists, David Rayside shows that gays, lesbians, and their political issues are still on the fringe of the political mainstream. His landmark study of political access demonstrates that, despite the overall tempering of anti-gay rhetoric in the 1990s, opponents of equality are formidable, and standing up for sexual minorities is still widely thought to be politically risky.Rayside documents a high-profile controversy in each of three countries: gays and lesbians in the military in the United States, sexual orientation and human rights legislation in Canada, and the age-of-consent battle in the United Kingdom. In addition, in-depth interviews of openly gay elected officials from three countries-U.S. Congressman Barney Frank, Canadian Member of Parliament Svend Robinson, and British M.P. Chris Smith-provide an inside look at the political process: the negotiation of gay and lesbian policy issues on a daily basis, the attitudes of colleagues in various political parties, and the tensions created when grassroots and mainstream activism intersect with each other.

<p>Through letters written to the women’s pages in agricultural newspapers, they forged a vital network that supported, encouraged and educated women in ways to improve their rural lives. Their letters show how these rural women made significant and vital contributions to the settlement and development of the Canadian North-West.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.55556490024 Pounds, Width: 0.37 Inches",24.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/70/9780889202870.jpg,Success,96,21.1

Hiv Leads To Aids. Aids Kills. This Is The Hypothesis. All Aids Researchers Of Whatever Persuasion Accept This As No More Than A Hypothesis. Joan Shenton, A Prize-winning Medical Journalist, Was Caught Up In The Dramatic David And Goliath Battle Between The Aids Orthodoxy And Dissenters Who Have Questioned The Hypotheses Of The Orthodoxy. What Startled Shenton, During Her Investigations For Channel 4 Tv, Was The Shrill Vehemence With Which The Scientific Orthodoxy Dismissed The Work Of Other Aids Researchers Who Postulated The Possibility That Hiv Was A Harmless Retro-virus, That Aids Was Not An Infectious Condition And That, Even If It Were, It Was Not Hiv Which Broke Down A Body's Immune System But Rather The Toxic Assault From Drug Abuse, Drug 'treatments' For Aids And, In Haemophiliacs, Impurities From Repeated Clotting Factor Transfusions. In This Book Shenton Introduces Scientists Who Maintain That Hiv Has Never Been Isolated And That The Hiv Test Is Simply Picking Up Proteins Said To Be Specific To The Virus, But Which Reside In All Of Us And Happen To Become Raised When The Body's Immune System Is Compromised For Other Reasons. She Has Recorded An Extra-ordinary Account Of The Tyranny Of Orthodoxy Imposed By Some Scientists And The Pharmaceutical Industry Which, According To Shenton, Has Distorted And Derailed The Process Of Scientific Inquiry, Cost Billions Of Misspent Dollars For 'treatment' And Misdirected Research Funding, And Condemned Tens Of Thousands Of Individuals With The Stigma And Anxiety Of An Hiv-positive Label. Through Her Attempts To Investigate Aids Research Shenton Paints A Fascinating Picture Of Collusion Between Science And Commerce. Her Book Makes A Real Contribution To Our Understanding Of The Debates Surrounding Hiv And Aids And Raises Disturbing Questions About The Relationship Between Scientific Analysis, Public Health And Commercial Interest.--jacket.

Sandra Harding introduces and discusses an array of postcolonial science studies, and their implications for ""northern"" science. All three science studies strains have developed in the context of post-World War II science and technology projects. They illustrate how technoscientific projects mean different things to different groups. The meaning attached by the culture of the West may not be shared or may be diametrically opposite in the cultures in other parts of the world. All, however, would agree that scientific projects &#151; modern science included &#151; are ""local knowledge systems."" The interests and discursive resources that the various science studies bring groups to their projects, and the ways that they organize the production of their kind of science studies, are distinctively culturally-local also. While their projects may be unintentionally converging, they also conflict in fundamental respects.How is this inevitable cultural-situatedness of knowledge both an invaluable resource as well as a limitation on the advance of knowledge about nature? What are the distinctive resources that the feminist and postcolonial science theorists offer in thinking about the history of modern science; the diversity of ""scientific"" traditions in non-European as well as in European cultures; and the directions that might be taken by less androcentric and Eurocentric scientific projects? How might modern sciences' projects be linked more firmly to the prodemocratic yearnings that are so widely voiced in contemporary life? Carefully balancing poststructuralist and conventional epistemological resources, this study concludes by proposing new directions for thinking about objectivity, method, and reflexivity in light of the new understandings developed in the post-World War II world.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",20,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/69/9780253211569.jpg,Success,154,21.1

This book is about shopping for ordinary things. It is also about love and devotion manifest within families and about the nature of sacrificial ritual. A significant contributor to material culture studies, Daniel Miller is an acute observer and an exceptional storyteller. He approaches shopping not as an end in itself but as a means to discover what people's practices, closely observed, reveal about their relationships. The ethnographic sections of the book are based on a year's study of shopping on a street in North London. This provides the basis for a sensitive description of how shoppers develop and imagine the social relationships most important to them through the medium of selecting goods. Among the characteristics of these shopping expeditions are the concept of ""the treat,"" and the centrality of thrift. Miller juxtaposes on his account of shopping various theories that anthropologists have brought to bear on the ritual of sacrifice, including that of the French philosopher George Bataille. He then integrates these elements to postulate his theory of shopping as sacrifice in terms as original and as utterly engaging as the stories he tells of individual shoppers.",en,Edition Unstated,"Height: 8.93 Inches, Length: 5.91 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.57 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/10/9780801485510.jpg,Success,153,21.1

It is something different, far more intriguing: a collection of stories that aim at being what Herman Melville deemed ""an inside narrative."" That is, what being a gay man in a foreign land really feels like, smells like, tastes like, and hurts like. The voices here might be likened to those of friends sitting around a dinner table the night before your journey who provide you with insights and warnings that only later do you discover add infinitely to your excursion.""</p>

Its combination of historical references, conspiracy theory and action/thriller format have earned it cult status over the years and may have paved the way for books like <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>. Imposing a new format on a ""classic"" can be a tall order and a daunting task for a performer; fortunately, Susan Denaker's talents are level to the material. The book offers a full variety of challenges to a reader: over 60 characters, young and old, male and female, with accents from around the world. None of these pose any obstacle to Denaker, who deftly sculpts a voice for every one, including several famous historical characters. The Monteglane Service, a bejeweled chess set that holds great power, has been buried in an obscure abbey in the French countryside and later scattered throughout Europe to keep it out of the wrong hands. The tale takes place both in the 1790s and the 1970s, when it may finally fall into evil hands. Denaker is able to emphasize the appropriate speech nuances of each century with subtlety and deftness by adding the cadence of the aural to the mix. Perhaps the audio book, too, will reach cult status. <I>A Ballantine paperback (Reviews, Nov. 4, 1988).

These narratives, both real and imagined, represent a range of personal and critical perspectives; some of the women describe their travels as expansive and freeing, while others relate the dreadful costs and sacrifices of relocating.</p>
<p>Despite the range of essays featured in this study, the writings all coalesce around the issues of politics, poetry, and self- identity described by Adrienne Rich as the elements of the ""politics of location,"" treated here as the politics of <i>re</i>location. The narratives featured in this book explore the impact of race, class, and sexual economics on migratory women, their self-identity, and their roles in family and social life. These issues demonstrate that in addition to geographic place, ideology is itself a space to be traversed.</p>
<p>By examining the writings of such women as Louise Erdrich, Zora Neale Hurston, and Gertrude Stein, the essayists included in this volume offer a variety of experiences. The book confronts such issues as racist politicking against Native Americans, African Americans, and Asian immigrants; sexist attitudes that limit women to the roles of wife, mother, and sexual object; and exploitation of migrants from Appalachia and of women newly arrived in America.</p>
<p>These essays also delve into the writings themselves by looking at what happens to narrative structure as authors or their characters cross geographic boundaries. The reader sees how women writers negotiate relocation in their texts and how the written word becomes a place where one finds oneself.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.47930177802 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/67/9780826211767.jpg,Success,160,21.1

Author of many books, both fiction and non-fiction, which challenge our thinking about the politics of sex, Third World development, the Arab world and writing itself, she has been a constant thorn in the side of the class and patriarchal systems.<p>This collection of her non-fiction writing since the publication of her seminal book on Arab women <i>The Hidden Face of Eve</i> (Zed Books, 1980) presents the full range of her extraordinary work. She explores a host of topics from women&#8217;s oppression at the hands of recent interpretations of Islam to the role of women in African literature, from the sexual politics of development initiatives to tourism in a &#8216;post-colonial&#8217;age, from the nature of cultural identity to the subversive potential of creativity, from the fight against female genital mutilation to problems facing the internationalization of the women&#8217;s movement. Throughout her writing, she sheds new light on the power of women in resistance - against poverty, racism, fundamentalism, and inequality of all kinds.<p>Showing the intellectual and political development of an important thinker for the late twentieth century, this book is essential reading for students and lecturers in women&#8217;s studies, development studies and social theory. It is also a book anyone who wants to understand current global politics - in their widest sense - can not do without. <p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Although hardly a household name in the United States, Saadawi is called by Britain's Guardian, according to her publisher, ""the leading spokeswoman on the status of women in the Arab world."" The 23 essaysmostly academic papers and speeches to conferencesthat make up this collection fall under several general topics that range from women's health to women and Islamic fundamentalism to women organizing for change. A medical doctor who was general director of Egypt's Department of Health, Saadawi was imprisoned by President Anwar Sadat, she claims, after criticizing him for preaching democracy while practicing a dictatorship. After three months, and Sadat's assassination, she was freed by his successor, Hosni Mubarak. The translations of her essays (by various people) tend to be stilted, and Saadawi has a weakness for writing sentences like, ""All these different levels of inequality are linked together in the patriarchal capitalism system that governs the world today."" But when she abandons jargon and speaks directly about issues of poverty, health and women's role in fundamentalist societies, her book sizzles.

0-452-27719-1,Sexual Ecology: AIDS and the Destiny of Gay Men,"Rotello, Gabriel",Plume,336,6/1/1998,,Paperback,"Rotello, an award-winning journalist and long-time AIDS activist, has done in this book something no writer has done before. Weaving together the strands of ecology theory, epidemiology, and sexual politics, he shows how the AIDS epidemic, like other epidemics from influenza and bubonic plague to today's rapidly emerging viruses - result as much from human behaviors as from specific microbes. He argues convincingly that AIDS was probably an old and rare disease syndrome in humans that erupted into an epidemic only when cultural changes - including the gay male sexual revolution of the seventies - created ideal conditions for its evolution and spread. For the first time ever, Rotello describes in detail the surprising scientific consensus about why, precisely, AIDS hit gay men so hard. Rebutting both the left's position that AIDS was merely an accident, and simplistic right-wing theories that blame promiscuity alone, Rotello presents the compelling but troubling verdict embraced by epidemiologists: AIDS was spread by a fusion of factors built right into the fabric of urban gay life after Stonewall. Turning to current research, Rotello explains how and why researchers believe a ""second wave"" of the epidemic is saturating gay men despite widespread AIDS awareness and condom use. And he provides compelling evidence that if the current lack of ecological awareness continues, our best chance of containing the epidemic with newly available drug therapies could be squandered.

                        <p>Intensively researched, passionately argued, and intellectually rigorous, this book sounds a clarion call for the revision of the gay male community's beliefs about and approaches to AIDS. Not since And the Band Plays On has there been another book with the power to fundamentally challenge social perceptions of this virulent modern plague. 352 pp. National ads/media. Author tour.

Billy's Boy is about John William Seden, the son of dead gay track star Billy Sive. A 12-year-old science geek with his head in the stars, narrator William (he goes by his middle name) uses the phrase potty mouth with sincerity, calls his mom's best friend Auntie and is completely ignorant about sex. He doesn't have an inkling that his mom (a women's track coach whose favorite exclamation is Goddess!) is a lesbian; she, despite her political fervor, remains uncharacteristically closeted to her pubescent son. The novel opens as the Hedens are moving from Sacramento to conservative Orange County, Calif. William quickly becomes friends with Shawn, a neighbor his age, but when their relationship becomes sexual, Shawn's born-again parents put an end to it. The Hedens then flee to Auntie's home near L.A., where William's search for information about his dead father brings him closer to a family he never knew he had, into the life and times of the L.A. riots and into the urban teen pastimes of clubbing and drugs. Warren's experience as an educator of gay teens lends her young characters some needed realism. While clichd situations and clunky dialogue leave much to be desired, Warren's fans will no doubt be eager to continue following the lives of their friends Harlan, Vince, Chino and Betsy through a new, young pair of eyes.

Her Other Projects Include Photographing Anne Sexton's Childhood Home And Walden Pond. Along The Way She Keeps Searching For Some Sign Of Sanity And Order Amid The Mediocrity, Waste, Pointlessness, Vulgarity, Junk Food, And Tv Programs Of Contemporary America. She's An Astute Observer Of Modern Life's Strange Complexities - Windows That Don't Open, The Footwear Of Endodontists, And Husbands Who Don't Talk - And At The Same Time She's Hilariously And Poignantly Caught Up In Them. The Decline Of Our Culture And Everyday Decency Are Brought Into Sharp Focus By This Unique, Besieged Sensibility, As Is The Beauty Of Vegetarianism, The Use Of Mozart For Transcending Root-canal Therapy, And The Heartache Of Floor Refinishing And Fluorescent Lighting.

When She's Not Working On Her Idiosyncratic Photo-essays (flowers In Decline, Reproductive Surgeons And Their Dogs), Isabelle Spends An Inordinate Amount Of Time Chasing Down Objects Essential For Her Daily Life, Like Organic Vegetables And Reversible Alpaca Coats From England. Meanwhile, She Keeps Up A Barrage Of Exceedingly Manic Diatribes On Such Pressing Subjects As The Greenhouse Effect, The Passage Of Time And How Annoying Swedish People Can Be-all Expressed In Borderline Hysterical, Impeccably Crisp Diction, Like Miss Manners With The Wrong Prescription. The Best Of These Stories Are Hilariously Funny, Filled With The Horrors Of Modern Life (bad Architecture, Traffic Jams, The Smell Of Peanuts On The Bus) And Wacky Exchanges With Her Loudmouthed Reproductive Surgeon, Dr. Loquesto, Her Careless Floor Sander, The Guy At The Discount Drugs Or Her Neighbors In Nantucket And East Hampton. Some Of The Stories May Remind The Reader Of A Long Phone Conversation With A Batty, Obsessed Neighbor Who Doesn't Know When To Hang Up.

(pearl sydenstricker), 1892-1973, Biography",Paperback,"<p>'an Elegant, Absorbing Book.' Washington Post</p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>in This Brilliantly Conceived Biography, Conn, An English Professor At The University Of Pennsylvania, Sets Out To Reconstruct Buck's Life, Her Extraordinary Commitment To Social Justice And Her Literary Achievement. To Her Many (primarily Male) Critics, Buck Was An Overrated Storyteller Whose Best-selling Portrayals Of Chinese Peasants Struggling In A Land On The Brink Of Revolution In No Way Merited The Pulitzer Or Nobel Prizes. Time And The Reading Public Seem To Have Agreed, As Only The Good Earth Survivesprincipally As A Late-night Movie Classic. Born In West Virginia In 1892 To Protestant Missionary Parents, Pearl Sydenstricker Spent Almost All Of Her First 40 Years In China. Although She Was Bilingual, She Felt An Outsider In Both Countries, And Conn Speculates That Her Experiences In China's White Minority Led To A Lifelong Advocacy Of Interracial Understanding. She Went To College In The U.s., But Returned To China, Where She Married Her First Husband, J. Lossing Buck, And Gave Birth To Her Only Child, Who Suffered From Phenylketonuria (pku). Then, In 1934, Faced With The Japanese Invasion, Civil Tensions And Escalating Anti-foreigner Sentiment, The Bucks Returned To The U.s. As Her Literary Works Slipped Into Obscurity, Buck Spent The Decades Until Her Death In 1973 Devoting Herself To Issues Of Interracial Conflict, Immigration And The Adoption Of Disadvantaged Children, Eventually Establishing Welcome House, The First International, Interracial Adoption Agency. Perhaps Buck's Fortunes Have Finally Turned, For She Has Been Singularly Lucky In Her Biographer. Drawing On Buck's Own Words And Actions, Conn Steers A Sympathetic Yet Intelligently Balanced Course, Revealing In Fascinating Detail The Gripping Life Story Of A Compelling Woman. Photos.

Often, the bereaved feels isolated, and looking around for comfort, realizes that he doesn&rsquo;t have many resources to turn to, but Gay Widowers&#58; Life After the Death of a Partner is a start. By offering first-person accounts of becoming a widower, this book, the first of its kind, allows others who are about to lose or already have lost a partner to find support, validation, recognition, and fellowship. Its editor and contributors hope that by sharing their stories of loss, pain, and bewilderment, they will help others in mourning as well as make one more step forward in their own healing.<P>Men of different ages and ethnic, religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds join together in Gay Widowers to remind other gay widowers that they are not alone and that their feelings of pain, anger, and emptiness are normal and legitimate. Not solely a book about life after the loss of a partner to AIDS, this book is about rebuilding life as a bereaved gay man, regardless of the cause of your partner&rsquo;s death. You will find encouragement for moving your life forward, without shutting your memories away, as you read about&#58;<br>&bull; *how homophobia can complicate a gay widower&rsquo;s grieving and mourning&bull; *handling financial and legal matters before and after death&bull; *specific mental health issues of gay widowers&bull; *dating again&bull; *similarities among gay widowers&#8217;responses to their partners&#8217;deaths&bull; *making time for your feelings rather than avoiding them&bull; *finding love after or during bereavement&bull; *trauma theory&rsquo;s applications to gay widowers<p>By bringing forth these stories, Gay Widowers offers bereaved gay men, psychologists, counselors, and social workers&#151;in a society where the mourning process is generally a heterosexual, social construct&#151;a clinical overview of the psychodynamic issues relevant, and perhaps unique, to the mourning process of gay men.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>In response to a society where the mourning process is typically a heterosexual, social construct, this collection of first-person accounts offers bereaved men, psychologists, and social workers a practical and clinical overview of the mourning process.

In sports and entertainment, literature and life in general, lesbians are the queen arbiters of what's hot, what's chic, and what's a girl to do? But even though a lot of people would like to become lesbians, like anything that requires a major break with old habits, becoming a lesbian is not the easiest thing in the world to pull off. Lesbians have their own culture, their own lingo, their own way of doing things. In ""Lesbianism Made Easy,"" Helen Eisenbach helps smooth the potentially difficult transition that a would-be daughter of Sappho may face. She shows that anyone can experience the Lesbian Within, the place where fantasy and reality meet.

Of Calif., Davis; Brave New Families, 1990) Joins The Family Values Fray On The Side Of Americans Who Have No Leisure To Debate The Virtues Of How A Two-parents/mom-at-home Family Benefits Children. They Are Too Busy Scrambling To Earn A Living; Even If There Is An Involved Father, Mom Can't Afford To Stay Home Anymore. In A Relatively Short Text (there Are More Than 40 Pages Of Notes And Bibliography), Stacey Argues That Poverty And Unemployment, Among Other Social And Economic Forces, Have Driven The Reshaping Of The American Family And That Critics, Whether On The Right Or The Left, Have Two Choices&#58; They Can Accept And Work With The Array Of Families As They Actually Exist, Or They Can Continue To Deny Conditions As They Are. Moreover, She Finds That Reorganized Families Cut Across Economic And Class Lines; They Are Not Limited To Either The Poor Or The Upper Middle Class. Both Liberals And Conservatives Target The Fatherless Household As A Prime Disrupter Of Family Values, But Stacey Sees The Campaign To Restore The Father To His Supposedly Rightful Place As Thinly Disguised Form Of Anti-feminism, Racism, And Homophobia. One Chapter Is Devoted To How Groups Of Social Scientists Have Supported This Intensely Conservative Viewpoint Despite Research To The Contrary. A Final Chapter Defends Homosexual Marriages And Parenting Practices, Offering This Group's Flexible Family Arrangements As An Example Of New Family Values In Microcosm.<p> Addressed More To The Author's Sociologist And Feminist Colleagues Than To The General Reader.

Even new programs, such as 'John Schools' for customers and training in life skills for service providers, have been ineffective. Deborah Brock asks if our approach to prostitution is fundamentally flawed. We generally think of it as a social problem, but prostitutes see it as a work relation.</p><p>Anti-prostitution campaigns and attempts to regulate the sex trade have been made and re-made over the past few decades. In the 1970s and 1980s urban development and new policing strategies displaced workers from established prostitution strolls. Movements for social and sexual liberation turned the business of selling sex into a complex political issue. The Canadian state was confronted with a range of regulatory approaches, advocated by competing interest groups. Deborah Brock examines how prostitution in Canada has been produced as a social problem. Contending that 'social problems do not exist objectively,' Brock interprets the role of various actors in mounting the urban sex trade spectacle: the media, feminist organizations, rights advocates, residents' groups, and state agents and agencies such as the police, politicians, the courts, and government commissions.</p><p><b>Making Work, Making Trouble</b> is the first critical survey of prostitution in Canada.

In response, the Ms. Foundation created Take Our Daughters to WorkÂ« Day: a national intervention which became successful beyond all imagination. Every last Thursday in April, for one day, millions of girls experience the adult workplace firsthand. As the Ms. Foundation discovered, girls come away from that experience with important lessons that lead to a lifetime of confidence. These lessons, gathered together in Girls Seen and Heard, can help girls soar when they take their place as women in the world and in the workforce. Girls learn how to make their voices heard, take control of their lives, and invest in their futures. Following practical instructions that reach beyond theory, girls gain the knowledge necessary to collaborate with others; to network and negotiate; to effect change; and to rise to all of lifeÃs challenges. An interactive manual for parents of girls of all ages, the book includes a readerÃs group guide and a resource directory. Published to coincide with Take Our Daughters to WorkÂ« Day 1998, the messages in this book are indispensable for girls: believe in your abilities, explore your options, command respect. To date, the focus has been on defining the problems that beset girls at adolescence; here, finally, are long-term concrete solutions that will help girls turn their dreams of the future into reality.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/64/9780874779264.jpg,Success,179,21.1

0-8050-3650-4,N is for Noose,"Grafton, Sue",Henry Holt,289,5/15/1998,,Hardcover,"<p>""When I first wrote <i>Alibi</i>, Grafton is quoted as saying, ""I was just trying to get it done. I certainly wasn't thinking about a series."" With that profound statement hovering somewhere in her past, Sue Grafton now offers her fourteenth novel in the popular Alphabet Mystery series. <i>""N"" Is for Noose</i> finds Kinsey investigating the mysterious death of Nota Lake sheriff Tom Newquist. But when it becomes clear that the strange town has some very dark secrets, Kinsey realizes that if she's not careful, she could be the victim of the town's next crime.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The noose of the title implies a tight knot, but the twists and turns of Grafton's latest plot are pretty loose. Not that the fans of self-reliant PI Kinsey Millhone's 13 previous alphabet appearances (from 1982's <i>A Is for Alibi</i> through 1996's <i>M Is for Malice</i>) are likely to object. This story takes Kinsey away from her Southern California coastal town of Santa Teresa to the small mountain community of Nota Lake in the Sierras. There, Selma Newquist hires Kinsey to ferret out the problem that had been seriously bothering her cop husband, Tom, before his recent death from a heart attack. Kinsey's efforts are soon stonewalled as the residents of Nota Lake unite, suggesting that the widow is being troublesome while the good-guy cop should be left to rest in peace. Kinsey wonders whether the townspeople might be right until she is seriously beaten up in her Nota Lake motel room. Focusing on finding the dead man's missing notebook, she follows his trail to a seedy hotel not far from Santa Teresa that he visited a few weeks before his death. While keeping a suspicious eye on the dead man's police partner and a few other local figures, Kinsey determines that Tom Newquist had been investigating an old murder near Nota Lake, which may have had ties to a similar, recent murder. Lots of coincidences, some over-the top characters, including a hyper-raunchy older woman, and some unprepared-for elements contribute to the rather chaotic climax. But Grafton's easy-reading, intelligent prose and her heroine's sharp humor, served up dark and wry, make up for a slew of plot weaknesses. Mystery Guild main selection; Literary Guild selection.

0-8203-1950-3,The Journals of Louisa May Alcott,"Alcott, Louisa May",University of Georgia Press,400,10/1/1997,,Paperback,"<p><p>From her eleventh year to the month of her death at age fifty-five, Louisa May Alcott kept copious journals. She never intended them to be published, but the insights they provide into her remarkable life are invaluable.<p>Alcott grew up in a genteel but impoverished household, surrounded by the literary and philosophical elite of nineteenth-century New England, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Like her fictional alter ego, Jo March, she was a free spirit who longed for independence, yet she dutifully supported her parents and three sisters with her literary efforts. In the journals are to be found hints of Alcott's surprisingly complex persona as well as clues to her double life as an author not only of ""high"" literature but also of serial thrillers and Gothic romances.<p>Associate editor Madeleine B. Stern has added an in-depth introduction to <i>The Journals of Louisa May Alcott</i>, the only unabridged edition of Alcott's private diaries.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Prepared by the editors of Alcott's letters and recently discovered thrillers, this volume deepens appreciation for the industrious author. The journals open in 1843, when ``LMA'' was 11, and continue through March 1888, four days before her death at age 56. One grows to feel close to the Alcotts of Concord, Mass.--like the Marches of Little Women , kept poor by the father's visionary schemes. As a girl, Louisa became the chief supporter of her parents and siblings, working at menial jobs, but always writing (and prudently tailoring stories and poems to specific markets). There is no lack of love in the author's references to her dependents, but she sometimes confessed to envying the security that her labor gave them. Alcott's journals offer a literate, poignant, often humorous portrait of a singular woman. Photos not seen by PW.

War, fame, marriage, love, and heartbreak came and went. What never changed was the bond she shared with her two best friends, Effa Commander and Whippy Bird. When scandal, murder, and betrayal made a legend of May Anna, only Effa and Whippy Bird could set the record straight.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Narrator Effa Commander's rollicking reminiscences about movie star Marion Street and her devoted lover, champion boxer Buster Midnight, are recounted in a sharp and snappy voice that captures the reader's interest on the very first page of this amusing novel. Effa Commander and lifelong friend Whippy Bird shared childhood, adolescence, Prohibition and many other experiences with Marion and Buster in their hometown of Butte, Mont. They also know much more about the Hollywood scandal called the ``Love Triangle Murder'' than ever got into the papers, and Effa Commander has decided to vindicate her friends' misrepresented lives. Dallas's first novel depicts a remarkable cluster of enduring friendships that may strike the modern urban reader as implausible, but accurately reflect the flavor of a small town and its inbred relationships. If the denouement seems predictable, Dallas, whose work calls to mind Fannie Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle-Stop Cafe , is nonetheless a stylist to be reckoned with.
