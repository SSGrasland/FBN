Her mother is a recovering alcoholic still grieving the death of her first husband; her stepfather, a struggling writer, is wrestling with his own demons. And now Rosie finds that her athletic gifts, once a source of triumph and escape, place her in peril, as a shadowy man who stalks her from the bleachers seems to be developing an obsession of his own...</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Before she won deserved acclaim for her two recent nonfiction books, Operating Instructions and Bird by Bird, Lamott wrote Rosie, an enchanting novel whose eponymous protagonist is a nine-year-old girl whose father dies suddenly and whose mother becomes an alcoholic. In revisiting the characters and idyllic Northern California setting of that book, Lamott again demonstrates her irrepressible, edgy humor and a new, deeper understanding of psychological nuance. Rosie Ferguson is now 13 and a rising star in the teenage tennis circuit, playing doubles with her best friend, Simone. Her mother, Elizabeth, who loves Rosie fiercely but who often can't cope, has married writer James. and a warm extended family of friends-Rae and Lank and the elderly Adderlys-cherish Rosie. But wrapped up in their own problems, the adults in her life unwittingly fail Rosie at a critical time in her adolescence. Remote and neurotic Elizabeth, takes to her bed in depression; Jack is absorbed in his new book; Charles Adderly is dying. Skinny, undeveloped Rosie has the familiar self-conscious adolescent insecurities and yearnings to be part of the in-crowd. Her tensions mount when Simone is seduced and becomes pregnant, with Rosie her sole confidante. Suddenly, the only constant person in Rosie's life is Luther, a menacing drifter who follows her from tournament to tournament. Thus, he is the only one who knows Rosie's most dreadful secret: that she has become a compulsive cheater on the tennis court. With a sureness of narrative control and a maturity of vision, Lamott underplays the drama here by maintaining a leisurely pace with numerous scenes of domestic minutiae. But her restraint pays off in credibility: she writes with integrity and tenderness of the failure of parental love to protect children, and of the resilience that helps children step over the threshold to maturity.Simultaneous audio; author tour.

Exercises and activities such as journal writing, meditation, and painting will help mothers analyze their thoughts and face their fears during pregnancy. For use during birth, the book offers proven techniques for coping with labor pain without drugs, a discussion of the doctor or midwife&#8217;s role, and a look at the father&#8217;s responsibilities. Childbirth education should also include what to expect after the baby is born. Here are baby basics, such as how to bathe a newborn, how to get the little one to sleep, and tips for getting nursing off to a good start. Pregnancy, birth, and postpartum is a process of continuous learning and adjustment; <i>Birthing From Within</i> provides the necessary support and education to make each phase of birthing a rewarding experience.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>England, a registered nurse and certified nurse midwife, developed the ""birthing from within"" approach in a series of birthing classes to help mothers reclaim and celebrate the spiritual, emotional, and psychological aspects of birth as a rite of passage. Her book is a collection of methods that have been used for class participants. England is quick to point out that this ""is not a script or a rigid method,"" and she encourages parents and professionals to use those portions that are helpful. There are numerous exercises and activities to help parents, especially mothers, be in contact with their bodies and feelings. The author recommends throughout that the mother and her healthcare professional work together, giving numerous suggestions for making this a successful partnership. England has done a fair amount of research and does include numerous references; at the same time, she makes it a very personal book. It will appeal especially to patrons interested in alternative birthing methods. For large consumer health/patient education collections.

On the other hand, her graphic autobiographical account of her own sexual coming-of-age dwells on her ambivalent pleasure in violent sexual fantasiesa predilection she traces to growing up Jewish in Chicago during WWII, when her fear of becoming a victim of violence, fusing with parental strictures to keep erotic pleasure secret, led to fantasies of being a beautiful captured spy or Jewish prisoner. Writing in the tradition of Julia Kristeva and Helene Cixous, Roth meshes a sophisticated feminist critique of Freudian phallocentric society with psychoanalytic insights la Jacques Lacan and Eastern wisdom. Her wide-ranging meditation on women's suppression of their sexuality touches too sketchily on diverse topics (from androgyny to the gynecological profession), using an array of illustrative examples ranging from Plato to Masters and Johnson, and from Colurbet's female nudes to Robert Crumb's comics. Her prescription that releasing the Kundalini energies linked in yoga to creativity and arousal will trigger both a transformation of our sexual selves and a social revolution seems as vague and pointless as Madonna's exhortations that sex is a good thing.

<p>Until recently, radical and militant activists have been viewed largely as male, while women have been assumed to be apolitical, more interested in domestic concerns and personal relationships than in public issues and political controversies. Despite evidence that women have been involved in a wide range of political activities, from revolutionary parties to racial hate groups, little attention has been paid to women's radical action.</p>
<p><b>No Middle Ground</b> brings together a wide variety of contributors to uncover women's roles in radical and militant movements. Examining women's radicalism in the United States from the 1950s through the 1990s, the volume details women's activism in both right-wing and left-wing movements, in feminist as well as anti-feminist groups, and in both movements supporting racial equality and those favoring race supremacism. The essays shed light on the conditions which encourage women's militancy, the issues around which women mobilize, how they organize, and what divides them in organizations.</p>
<p>The essays and personal narratives in <b>No Middle Ground</b> advance our understanding of the gendered underpinnings of activism that occurs outside the ""middle ground"" of conventional electoral and pressure group politics.

While male artists exalted Woman's otherness in fetishized images, women artists explored their own subjective worlds. The self-images of Claude Cahun, Dorothea Tanning, Leonora Carrington, Frida Kahlo,<br>
 Meret Oppenheim, Remedios Varo, Kay Sage, and others both internalize and challenge conventions for representing femininity, the female body, and female subjectivity.<br>
 Many of the representational strategies employed by these pioneers continue to resonate in the work of contemporary women artists. The words ""Surrealist"" and<br>
 ""surrealism"" appear frequently in discussions of such contemporary artists as Louise Bourgeois, Ana Mendieta, Cindy Sherman, Francesca Woodman, Kiki Smith, Dorothy Cross, Michiko Kon, and Paula Santiago.This book, which accompanies an exhibition organized by the MIT List Visual Arts Center, explores specific aspects of the relationship between historic and contemporary work in the context of Surrealism.<br>
 The contributors reexamine art historical assumptions about gender, identity, and intergenerational legacies within modernist and postmodernist frameworks. Questions raised include: how did women in both groups draw from their experiences of gender and sexuality? What do contemporary artistic practices involving the use of body images owe to the earlier examples of both female and male Surrealists? What is the relationship between self-image and self- knowledge?Contributors : Dawn Ades,<br>

Billy Tipton's death in Spokane Washington, made news all over the world, not because he was celebrated as a musician but because of the scale of his deception -- he had been ""married"" to five women and had reared several adopted children -- and the scarcity of ready explanations endowed the skimpy available facts with the aura of myth.</p>
<p>Locked away in Billy's office closet lay the record of a lifetime's achievements: clippings and photographs documenting the transformation of Billy from <i>she</i> to <i>he</i>, and a legacy of annotated comic routines, musical arrangements, and program notes that tell an extraordinary story. These reveal how, night after night, Billy scattered clues and riddles about the drag she wore, including risque gags about homosexuality and jokes that called attention to the disguise. These convey the pride of an artist in his success in achieving a lifetime of deception -- and they wree so bold that they helped conceal Billy's secrets.</p>
<p><i>Suits Me</i> tells the life story of this brilliant deceiver with brio and pathos. To live at once in two skins, one of each sex, is not an everyday experience, yet we can hear Billy's loves and ambitions through the voices of those who knew him -- his ""wives,"" his family, his musical colleagues, and those who encountered him on the road as he traveled with the Billy Tipton Trio from town to town, bandstand to bandstand, gig to gig, during the jazz decades.</p>
<p>A masterpiece of skillful detection and perceptive storytelling, <i>Suits Me</i> not only casts a warm eye over the spectrum of the sexes but chronicles tanktown show business over a period of fifty years. Illustrated by Billy Tipton's photographs, this book also reveals, in words, music, history, and psychology, any number of secrets, plumbing mysteries about the American family that few of us have dared to face.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.56438339072 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",25.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/97/9780395654897.jpg,Success,137.0,21.2

Yet its Weaving Workshop, whose artists were almost all women, has received much less attention. As the author points out, when talented women arrived at the Bauhaus school, they soon discovered that its founder, Walter Gropius, was not adhering strictly to his ringing declaration of equality ""between the beautiful and the strong gender."" Textiles, in the hierarchy of art and design, were deemed ""women's work."" In this model study, superlatively illustrated with period photographs and examples of surviving textiles, Professor Weltge recreates the heady atmosphere of creative excitement at the Bauhaus. Drawing upon original archival research and interviews with Bauhaus survivors, their students, and leading contemporary designers, the author details the Weaving Workshop's history and its enduring legacy. In the early years of the Workshop, the emphasis was on hand weaving and individual artistic expression. However, following the Bauhaus exhibition of 1923, the Weaving Workshop moved to the forefront in developing prototypes for the textile industry. Eagerly embracing advanced technology, the artists incorporated new or unusual materials, produced multilayered cloths, and made extensive use of the Jacquard loom.

In the flashes that blur the line between fantasy and reality, each story captures the wild erotic experiences of a small group of professional, middle-class acquaintances, revealing sexual interludes of kaleidoscopic range--heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, exhibitionist, and sadomasochistic, from a woman s point of view, a man s, the participants , and a voyeur s. In each account, recurring characters encounter new venues to express the fearlessness of youth, the excitement for the new, and the nostaglia for the variety of love lost. Sensual, explicit, and daring, <B>Quiver</B> introduces a fresh voice in the genre of erotica. <BR> <UL> <LI> <B>Quiver</B> is a bestseller in Australia.<BR> <LI> Compare <B>Quiver</B> to <I>Eat Me</I> by Linda Jaivin, another erotic bestseller from Australia.<BR></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A woman bent on revenge, a man craving extremes and the self-doubts of middle age are all part of this diverse collection, already a bestseller in Australia. Although Learner, a screenwriter (HBO's The Unmasking of O), writes most often from the point of view of a straight woman, she occasionally adopts male and bisexual points of view, and she's best when she features a voyeuristic element. In the opening story, The Woman Who Was Tied Up and Forgotten, a married couple rekindle their passion with the joys of bondage, but even that innovation soon needs added spice. The clich that people in power really want domination is turned on its head in a surprising climax. Another tale, Looking for Strange, describes the allure of a single character from the perspectives of two lovers, which converge in the heated encounter of an adventurous threesome. Perhaps the most imaginative story, The Short Man in Crime, features a six-foot-five-inch woman who learns the beauty of her form from a five-foot-one-inch man. Some portraits are stronger than others, but each erotic narrative pushes the reader toward the next with great expectation, and the final story, The Promiscuity of Bats, joins all of the characters in a stalled elevator on Christmas Eve. One man puts a drug, ecstasy, in the champagne he's carrying and the ensuing orgy brings everyone back out for a curtain call. It's no mystery why this explicit debut has found an enthusiastic audience Down Under.

Making extensive use of archives in the United States, England, the Netherlands, Germany, and France, Leila Rupp examines the histories and accomplishments of three major transnational women's organizations to tell the story of women's struggle to construct a feminist international collective identity. She addresses questions central to the study of women's history—how can women across the world forge bonds, sometimes even through conflict, despite their differences?—and questions central to world history—is internationalism viable and how can its history be written?</p>
<p>Rupp focuses on three major organizations that were technically open to all women: the broadly based and cautious International Council of Women, founded in 1888; the feminist International Alliance of Women, originally called the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, founded in 1904; and the vanguard Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, which grew out of the International Congress of Women that met at The Hague in 1915. The histories of these organizations, and their stories of cooperation and competition, shed new light on the international women's movement. They also help us to understand the different but connected story of the second wave of international feminism that emerged from the ashes of World War II.</p>",en,Paper edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.06262810284 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches",55.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/57/9780691016757.jpg,Success,129.0,21.2

Manette Ansay explores the rural Midwest landscape and the people who inhabit it&#58; ordinary folk with extraordinary inner lives, struggling to make sense of the isolated, sometimes painful, and often intensely religious worlds in which they live. Her are 15 haunting and exquisitely written tales that offer a rare and unforgettable glimpse into the complexities of being human and being alive.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Holly's Field, Wis., the setting for Ansay's well-received debut novel, <i>Vinegar Hill</i>, again serves as background for many of the 15 precisely crafted, haunting stories in her first collection. The people in this town in the heartland of America try to make do with their lots in life, but many of them are already alienated or isolated and know that things will never get any better. In ""Ohio,'' 14-year-old Stuart travels to Massachusetts to visit the father who left the family and the church where he had been a pastor. Stuart's father lives with a woman he is not married to and has a daughter named Mars. Although Stuart's mission is to win his father's heart back to Christ, by the end of his trip it is he who has had his eyes opened, who says he has the ""sense you've crossed over to some distant place and stayed just a moment too long, so that return is no longer a possibility.'' The adults in this harsh Midwestern landscape deal with poverty, sickness, aging and the desire to transcend their daily lives. Geraldine's husband, in ""You or Me or Anything,'' drives off into the snow one day and calls from different points along his meandering route, to tell her that he's not coming back, she should be sure to let the dog in at night, there's a blizzard in Minnesota. The stressed-out 15-year-old narrator of the title story, which won the 1992 Nelson Algren Prize, has become a compulsive thief because it helps her mind to grow ""absolutely still, that stillness you get when you walk into a church and know that you are safe there.'' Pressured by her family's expectations of academic success, she recklessly gambles with her future, and her life. All of Ansay's characters have a dignity earned by coping with their existence; they elicit compassion from the reader, but not pity, because they are strong and will come through. Stubborn and resourceful, they endow her fictional town with presence and credibility.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.32 Inches, Weight: 0.31 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",12.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/73/9780380730773.jpg,Success,133.0,21.2

But This Time The Result Is A Joyous Journey Into A Past And Future Of Comic Mishaps And Historical Cross-purposes, In Which The Power Of Human Love Can Still Make All The Difference. On The Surface, England In The Summer Of 1888 Is Possibly The Most Restful Time In History--lazy Afternoons Boating On The Thames, Tea Parties, Croquet On The Lawn--and Time Traveler Ned Henry Is Badly In Need Of A Rest. He's Been Shuttling Back And Forth Between The 21st Century And The 1940s Looking For A Victorian Atrocity Called The Bishop's Birdstump. It's Only The Latest In A Long String Of Assignments From Lady Schrapnell, The Rich Dowager Who Has Invaded Oxford University.^ She's Promised To Endow The University's Time-travel Research Project In Return For Their Help In Rebuilding The Famed Coventry Cathedral, Destroyed In A Nazi Air Raid Over A Hundred Years Before. But The Bargain Has Turned Into A Nightmare. Lady Schrapnell's Motto Is God Is In The Details, And As The 125th Anniversary Of The Cathedral's Destruction--and The Deadline For Its Proposed Completion--approaches, Time-travel Research Has Fallen By The Wayside. Now Ned And His Colleagues Are Frantically Engaged In Installing Organ Pipes, Researching Misericords, And Generally Risking Life And Limb. So When Ned Gets The Chance To Escape To The Victorian Era, He Jumps At It. Unfortunately, He Isn't Really Being Sent There To Recover From His Time-lag Symptoms, But To Correct An Incongruity A Fellow Historian, Verity Kindle, Has Inadvertently Created By Bringing Something Forward From The Past. In Theory, Such An Act Is Impossible.^ But Now It Has Happened, And It's Up To Ned And Verity To Correct The Incongruity Before It Alters History Or, Worse, Destroys The Space-time Continuum. And They Have To Do It While Coping With Eccentric Oxford Dons, Table-rapping Spiritualists, A Very Spoiled Young Lady, And An Even More Spoiled Cat. As Ned And Verity Try Frantically To Hold Things Together And Find Out Why The Incongruity Happened, The Breach Widens, Time Travel Goes Amok, And Everything Starts To Fall Apart--until The Fate Of The Entire Space-time Continuum Hangs On A SÚance, A Butler, A Bulldog, The Battle Of Waterloo, And, Above All, On The Bishop's Birdstump. At Once A Mystery Novel, A Time-travel Adventure, And A Shakespearean Comedy, To Say Nothing Of The Dog Is A Witty And Imaginative Tale Of Misconceptions, Misunderstandings, And A Chaotic World In Which The Shortest Distance Between Two Points Is Never A Straight Line, And The Secret To The Universe Truly Lies In The Details.

Exploring How Women And Men Relate To Nature And Violence, Mary Zeiss Stange Demonstrates How False Assumptions About Women And About Hunting Permeate Contemporary Thought. Her Book Is A Profound Critique Of Our Society's Evasion Of Issues That Make Us Uncomfortable, And It Culminates In A Surprising Claim&#58; That Only By Appreciating The Value Of Hunting Can We Come To Understand What It Means To Be Human.<p>controversial And Original, Defying Easy Stereotypes,woman The Hunter Is Sure To Provoke Strong Reactions In Almost Every Reader.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>a Recent New York Times Article Reported That Archeologists Have Uncovered Burial Sites Of What Are Thought To Be Sarmatian Warriors From About The Sixth To The Second Century B.c.and That The Bodies Uncovered Are Women's. This Is A Timely Article For Stange, An Instructor Of Religion And Women's Studies At Skidmore College, Who Argues That Women, Too, Possess A Natural Hunting Instinct That Has More To Do With A Mode Of Awareness, A Discreet Style Of Engagement, Than With Pulling A Trigger. Writing As A Feminist, Stange Attacks The Theories And Arguments Of Radical Eco-feminists, Who Oppose Women's Participation In Such Male-identified Activities As Hunting, And Argues That Such A Position Assumes A Close Connection Between Women And The Landscape That Not Only Reinforces Familiar Stereotypes Of Women As Creatures Of Emotion, Rather Than Reason, It Also Establishes For Women An Essentially Privileged Relation To Nature And Animals. Throughout The Book, Which Is Written In Two Stylesone Scholarly, The Other Memoiristicstange Maintains That When Approached Ethically And Responsibly, Hunting Does Not Destroy Or Change Nature Nearly As Much As Farming Does; In Fact, She Argues, [i]t Is The Farmer, Not The Hunter, Who Approaches The World Of Nature As Something Over Which He Must Seize Control. Stange Can Write, And She Can Make Convincing Arguments; Unfortunately She Doesn't Do Both At The Same Time. The Chapters About Her Hunts Are Well Written But Rarely Go Beyond The Impressionistic. And While The Chapters Containing Her Arguments Are Strong And Insightful, They Are Also Burdened By An Earnest, Clotted, Graduate-school Style. When She Unites Reasoning And Writing, She Will Be Ready For A Broad Trade Audience.

The year is 1086, twenty years after the Norman Conquest, and the new Norman lords are squeezing their Saxon subjects mercilessly. To survive, the townspeople of Enmore Green band together under the wise leadership of Father Edmund and Sirona, the local seeress who is teaching the healing arts to her foster daughter, Aldyth.

Since the facts don't do that too often, I decided to make it up. . . . That is the real power and joy of being an artist. We can make it come true. Or look true.""—Faith Ringgold, in a 1992 interview This catalog is the first book-length publication devoted to the exquisite story quilts of contemporary artist Faith Ringgold. Combining painted images, handwritten texts, and quilting techniques, Ringgold weaves together modernist painting; feminist critique; postmodernist strategies of appropriation, parody, and montage; and personal memoir in a remarkable synthesis that takes on European modernism, African American folk art, and the ""black aesthetic"" of the 1960s and 1970s. The catalog accompanies an exhibition of <i>The French Collection</i> and <i>The American Collection</i>, a series of story quilts Ringgold has produced since 1990. Catalog essays include an examination of Ringgold's stylistic development through the 1960s and 1970s, an exploration of the social and political aspects of the story quilts, and a recollection by the artist's daughter, writer Michele Wallace.<br>
Ringgold has adapted the tradition of the American slave quilt to create a world in which African Americans and women dominate, where history is not only questioned but also reinvented. The titles of the quilts in Ringgold's <i>French Collection</i> and <i>American Collection</i> suggest her subject range and daring: <i>Jo Baker's Birthday Party</i>; <i>Dinner at Gertrude Stein's</i>; <i>A Portrait of Aunt Jemima</i>; <i>Tubman, Douglass, and Truth: Wanted Dead or Alive</i> are examples. Faith Ringgold's broad audience of admirers (her books for children have won Caldecott and <i>New York Times</i> book illustration honors) will welcome <i>Dancing at the Louvre</i>. Finally there is a book that displays her artistic achievements and provides a full discussion of her importance within contemporary art.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10.38 Inches, Length: 10.38 Inches, Weight: 2.01943431992 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches",52.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/09/9780520214309.jpg,Success,42.0,21.2

The pressure on Runge was enormous: The Ducks had to earn the respect and recognition they needed to become a force in their league or decline into complete obscurity. While fighting a legal battle with the university administration for equal funding and support, Runge worked against the clock to improve the team's strategy and its collegiate standing. In the process, she taught the players the importance of self-esteem and commitment, and instilled in them a thirst for winning. As the players struggled with the pain of defeat, Runge put her career on the line by challenging the rules of collegiate politics. Game by game, the ragtag team built the strength that took them further than they ever thought they could go. And behind the scenes, their coach was maneuvering through a different, tough game of move and countermove, legal smarts, and gutsy cool against an establishment that wouldn't give in - until it had to.

                        <p>An unprecedented look inside the women's basketball team at the University of Oregon. Full Court Press celebrates the excitement, the tension, and the drama of women's basketball and explores the meaning of being a female athlete in America today. 288 pp. National publicity.

0-679-41291-3,The Murder of Helen Jewett: The Life and Death of a Prostitute in Nineteenth-Century New York,"Cohen, Patricia Cline",Knopf,432.0,1998-08-11,,Hardcover,"In 1836, the murder of a young prostitute made headlines in New York City and around the country, inaugurating a sex-and-death sensationalism in news reporting that haunts us today. Patricia Cline Cohen goes behind these first lurid accounts to reconstruct the story of the mysterious victim, Helen Jewett. <br>
<br>
From her beginnings as a servant girl in Maine, Helen Jewett refashioned herself, using four successive aliases, into a highly paid courtesan. She invented life stories for herself that helped her build a sympathetic clientele among New York City's elite, and she further captivated her customers through her seductive letters, which mixed elements of traditional feminine demureness with sexual boldness.<br>
<br>
But she was to meet her match—and her nemesis—in a youth called Richard Robinson. He was one of an unprecedented number of young men who flooded into America's burgeoning cities in the 1830s to satisfy the new business society's seemingly infinite need for clerks. The son of an established Connecticut family, he was intense, arrogant, and given to posturing. He became Helen Jewett's lover in a tempestuous affair and ten months later was arrested for her murder. He stood trial in a five-day courtroom drama that ended with his acquittal amid the cheers of hundreds of fellow clerks and other spectators.<br>
<br>
With no conviction for murder, nor closure of any sort, the case continued to tantalize the public, even though Richard Robinson disappeared from view. Through the Erie Canal, down the Ohio and the Mississippi, and by way of New Orleans, he reached the wilds of Texas and a new life under a new name. Through her meticulous and ingenious research, PatriciaCline Cohen traces his life there and the many twists and turns of the lingering mystery of the murder. Her stunning portrayals of Helen Jewett, Robinson, and their raffish, colorful nineteenth-century world make vivid a frenetic city life and sexual morality whose complexities, contradictions, and concerns resonate with those of our own time.",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.75 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",27.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/15/9780679412915.jpg,Success,141.0,21.2

Anne Wagner looks at their imagery and careers, relating their work to three decisive moments in the history of American modernism&#58; the avant-garde of the 1920s, the New York School of the 1940s and 1950s, and the modernist redefinition undertaken in the 1960s. Their artistic contributions were invaluable, Wagner demonstrates, as well as hard-won. She also shows that the fact that these artists were women&#151;the main element linking the three&#151;is as much the index of difference among their art and experience as it is a passkey to what they share.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In this scholarly new book, Wagner (history of art, Univ. of California, Berkeley) skillfully probes and tracks how each of these important American modernists at one time coped with life as both a professional artist and wife of a more famous one. ""O'Keeffe's Femininity"" demonstrates how infamous she was at rendering body imagery: ""to imagine an impossible unionthe passionate coupling of hygiene and scatology, the body and its absence."" Lee Krasner is shown painting her own way through Jackson Pollock's as well as Arshile Gorky's conventions until she eventually achieved autobiographical essays in paint and collage. Eva Hesse is optimistically identified as an innovative commentator on new sexuality, focusing on her body, but not her body alone. This gendered interpretation of three of the foremost American modernist women artists presents an interesting blend of biographical and historical criticism.

Author of many books, both fiction and non-fiction, which challenge our thinking about the politics of sex, Third World development, the Arab world and writing itself, she has been a constant thorn in the side of the class and patriarchal systems.<p>This collection of her non-fiction writing since the publication of her seminal book on Arab women <i>The Hidden Face of Eve</i> (Zed Books, 1980) presents the full range of her extraordinary work. She explores a host of topics from women&#8217;s oppression at the hands of recent interpretations of Islam to the role of women in African literature, from the sexual politics of development initiatives to tourism in a &#8216;post-colonial&#8217;age, from the nature of cultural identity to the subversive potential of creativity, from the fight against female genital mutilation to problems facing the internationalization of the women&#8217;s movement. Throughout her writing, she sheds new light on the power of women in resistance - against poverty, racism, fundamentalism, and inequality of all kinds.<p>Showing the intellectual and political development of an important thinker for the late twentieth century, this book is essential reading for students and lecturers in women&#8217;s studies, development studies and social theory. It is also a book anyone who wants to understand current global politics - in their widest sense - can not do without. <p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Although hardly a household name in the United States, Saadawi is called by Britain's Guardian, according to her publisher, ""the leading spokeswoman on the status of women in the Arab world."" The 23 essaysmostly academic papers and speeches to conferencesthat make up this collection fall under several general topics that range from women's health to women and Islamic fundamentalism to women organizing for change. A medical doctor who was general director of Egypt's Department of Health, Saadawi was imprisoned by President Anwar Sadat, she claims, after criticizing him for preaching democracy while practicing a dictatorship. After three months, and Sadat's assassination, she was freed by his successor, Hosni Mubarak. The translations of her essays (by various people) tend to be stilted, and Saadawi has a weakness for writing sentences like, ""All these different levels of inequality are linked together in the patriarchal capitalism system that governs the world today."" But when she abandons jargon and speaks directly about issues of poverty, health and women's role in fundamentalist societies, her book sizzles.

Raised in a privileged and protected world of private schools and posh clubs, Margo was a seriously overweight alcoholic with a $1,000 a week cocaine habit when she turned her life around and got clean, sober, and fit. Early in her addictions, she became friends with Jonathan Wright, an accomplished professional photographer and dedicated adventurer and climber who invited Margo to join him on a trek into his beloved Himalayas - a feat Margo knew she was both physically and emotionally incapable of performing. Years later, Jonathan's memory would help sustain her on her quest for a seemingly impossible dream that his life had inspired: to become the first woman in history to scale the highest peak on each of the Earth's seven continents. In 1988, Margo climbed her first two mountains - summiting Mt. Kenya and the awesome, intimidating Mt. Kilimanjaro. An ""ordinary"" middle-aged woman with no formal mountaineering training and no previous experience, she had met and triumphed over the toughest demands and conditions that Nature could provide. But that was just the beginning. Spurred on by her newborn love affair with the world's loftiest peaks and most beautiful and inaccessible places, she pushed herself even further, taking on increasingly greater climbing challenges as she pursued more difficult and dangerous goals under the most harrowing of circumstances. And somewhere along the way - amid magnificent wildernesses of towering pinnacles and breathtaking, ice-covered vistas - Margo Chisholm realized she had reached a summit deep within herself; a place in the heart and soul where she discovered the pride, fulfillment and inner peace she had always longed for.

                        <p>In a story of vast determination, passion, and self-discovery, a woman whose dream is to climb the highest peak on each of the seven continents tells her story through the prism of her own spiritual voyage. 8-page color photo insert. 336 pp. National media publicity.

0-380-73147-9,The Kiss,"Harrison, Kathryn",Harper Perennial,224.0,1998-06-01,,Paperback,"<p>We meet at airport. We meet in cities where we've never been before. We meet where no one will recognize us.A ""man of God"" is how someone described my father to me. I don 't remember who. Not my mother. I'm young enough that I take the words to mean he has magical properties and that he is good, better than other people.With his hand under my chin, my father draws my face toward his own. He touches his lips to mine. I stiffen.I am frightened by the kiss. I know it wrong, and its wrongness is what lets me know, too, that it is a secret.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Few memoirs receive the amount of prepublication hype that surrounds this slim and powerful autobiography by a writer whose lurid, psychologically vivid novels (Exposure, etc.) have portrayed sexual abuse, cruel power games and extreme, self-destructive behavior. Harrison here turns an unflinching eye on the episode in her life that has most influenced those books: a secret, sexual affair with her father that began when she was 20. Not surprisingly, the book is unremittingly novelistic: it unfolds in an impressionistic series of flashbacks and is told in the present tense in prose that is brutally spare and so emotionally numb as to suggest that recounting the affair is for Harrison is the psychological equivalent of reliving it. Abandoned by her father as a child, neglected by an emotionally remote and impetuous mother, Harrison is raised by her grandparents. She retreats at a young age into a complex interior life marked by religious fixations, bouts of anorexia and self-injury, rage at her callous mother and obsession with her absent father. A minister and amateur cameraman, her father visits Harrison after an absence of 10 years, when she is home from college on spring break. The boundary between flirtation and paternal affection is soon blurred, as her father lavishly dotes on her and, in parting, kisses her sexually on the mouth. A relationship of passionate promises, obsessive long-distance phone calls and letters then flourishes, as her father, presented here as ghoulishly predatory, relentlessly draws her into his web. Gradually consenting to his demands for sex, Harrison drops out of college and moves in with her father's new family, extricating herself from the affair only when her mother is stricken with metastatic breast cancer. Throughout the book, Harrison omits names, dates and locations, shrewdly fashioning these dark events into a kind of Old Testament nightmare in which incest is just one of a host of physical trials, from pneumonia to shingles, self-cutting and bulimia. If Harrison sacrifices objectivity in places for a mode of storytelling engineered for maximum shock value, most readers still will find this book remarkable for both the startling events it portrays and the unbridled force of the writing.

But when her father died in 1993, Fauziya's life changed dramatically. At age seventeen Fauziya was forced to marry a man she barely knew who already had three wives, and prepare for the tribal ritual of female genital mutilation—a practice that is performed without painkillers or antibiotics. But hours before the ritual was to take place, Fauziya's sister helped her escape to Germany, and from there she traveled to the United States seeking asylum—and freedom. Instead, she was stripped, shackled, and locked up in various INS detention facilities for sixteen months.<br>
<br>
Enter Layli Miller Bashir, a driven twenty-three-year-old law student who took on Fauziya's case. When the two women met, Layli found an emotionally broken, emaciated girl with whom she forged an extraordinary friendship. Putting her heart and soul into Fauziya's case, Layli enlisted help from the American University International Human Rights Clinic. The clinic's acting director, Karen Musalo, an expert in refugee law, assembled a team to fight on Fauziya's behalf. Ultimately, in a landmark decision that has given hope to many seeking asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution, Fauziya was granted asylum on June 13, 1996.<br>
<br>
Here, for the first time, is Fauziya's dramatic personal story, told in her own words, vividly detailing her life as a young woman in Togo and her nightmarish day-to-day existence in U.S. prisons. It is a story of faith and freedom, courage and inspiration—onethat <br>

But her latest case has a trail so cold there isn't a scent for her trusty hounds to trace. The crime is thirty years old. Two baby girls were kidnapped and their nanny murdered. The estate owner's daughter was discovered safe in a nearby church. The other, the gardener's child, was never found. The man convicted of the two crimes was a vagrant who stuck to his plea of innocence. Now, he's been released from prison for health reasons after serving three decades of a life sentence. The local sheriff is concerned about the effect of the convict's return on the community.

The book's preludea searing prose poem so evocative that it renders almost palpable the yew-scent of a sizzling hot summer graveyardis a promise of sensuality and intrigue that increases in intensity and produces a luxuriously gripping narrative. Nina and Isabel have a secret brother: his cot death when they were small changed their lives irrevocably. More than two decades later, when Isabel almost dies with the birth of her own son, Nina comes to help her out at her secluded country home. We quickly sense the deep bonds and tensions between the two sisters as Dunmore ingeniously swings the reader's sympathy from one to the other. Are we dealing with an angel and a devil? If so, which is which? Isabel's unmitigated selfishness seems shocking until Nina casually betrays her. Under the summer sun, long-smothered family nightmares inevitably surface. Despite the bristling heat her narrative conveys, Dunmore's style is coolly beautiful, with many a memorable phrase. ""Things are happening here that safely belong on the news, but we can't switch them off,"" muses Nina, as the elusive sense of horror builds slowly into a thunderous finale, and the devil is revealed.

The essays in this politically and historically revealing book demonstrate the sheer pervasiveness and range of rhetoric against the queen, illuminating the provocative discourse of disrespect and dissent that existed over an eighty-year period, from her troubled days as a princess to the decades after her death in 1603.<br>
As editor Julia M. Walker suggests, the breadth of dissent considered in this collection points to a dark side of the Cult of Elizabeth. Reevaluating neglected texts that had not previously been perceived as critical of the queen or worthy of critical appraisal, contributors consider dissent in a variety of forms, including artwork representing (and mocking) the queen, erotic and pornographic metaphors for Elizabeth in the popular press, sermons subtly critiquing her actions, and even the hostility encoded in her epitaph and in the placement of her tomb. Other chapters discuss gossip about Elizabeth, effigies of the queen, polemics against her marriage to the Duke of Alençon, common verbal slander, violence against emblems of her authority, and the criticism embedded in the riddles, satires, and literature of the period.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15081300764 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/46/9780822320746.jpg,Success,128.0,21.2

0-226-03885-8,Women on the Defensive: Living through Conservative Times,"Bashevkin, Sylvia",University of Chicago Press,326.0,1998-06-08,,Paperback,"<p><p>Feminism underwent perhaps its most difficult challenges in the 1980s, when conservatism reached the height of its influence in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. <i>Women on the Defensive&#58; Living through Conservative Times</i> explodes some widely-held beliefs about women and women's movements under Conservative and Republican leaders. <p>Prevailing accounts of the fate of women's movements in that decade ascribe their hardships to a postfeminist ideology or the result of a ""backlash"" against women, particularly in America. Sylvia Bashevkin's study excavates, however, a much more complex situation. By identifying the policies and goals held in common by feminists in all three countries and tracing their collision course with the conservative policies of the three administrations, she is able to document setbacks but also some progress, despite the right-of-center leaders. She also challenges the assumption that organized interests in the United States are less vulnerable in hard times than those in parliamentary systems, finding that the elections of Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, and Margaret Thatcher had similar effects on both sides of the Atlantic. Her comparative analysis reveals that the policies of current leaders, while marginally better than their predecessors, will not allow women and women's movements to regain lost ground.<p>Organized thematically, rather than by country, <i>Women on the Defensive</i> describes the difficult relationship between feminists and conservatives during a time of bitter ideological and policy battles when the vibrant social movements of the 1960s and 1970s were seriously threatened.<p></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Bashevkin (political science, U. of Toronto) studies the intersection of conservative governments and the women's movements in three countries (the US, England, and Canada), presenting analyses of governmental and legal practices as well as the words of women activists who talk about feminism in the 1980s and beyond.

Over The Course Of Producing 11 Books Of Fiction She Has Grown More Generous In Her Depictions Of The Emotional Lives Of Her Characters -- They Seem More Often Now To Have Some Access To Their Feelings. But Beattie Still Paints A World In Which People Never Really See One Another, And Are As Helpless To Connect As Ping-pong Balls Floating In An Airless Room. <p>in <i>my Life, Starring Dara Falcon</i>, Beattie's Narrator Is Jean Warner, Who Doesn't Realize She's Unhappily Married, Unhappily Situated, Until She Meets The Title Character, A Disturbed Young Woman Who Compulsively Pursues Other People's Husbands And Boyfriends And Tells Self-dramatizing Lies About Herself. The Troublemaker Calls Herself Dara Falcon, And If You By Chance Miss The Reference To Predation In Her Name, Beattie Is Careful To Point It Out To You. Everything, In Fact, Is Obvious In <i>my Life, Starring Dara Falcon</i> -- That Dara Is Trouble, That She Is Not To Be Trusted -- Obvious Except To Jean, That Is. It Becomes Increasingly Difficult To Sympathize With Jean Warner And Her Infatuation And Inevitable Disillusionment With Her Beautiful Bird Of Prey. When Jean Leaves Her Husband And His Close-knit Family, To Whom She Had At First Clung So Happily, It Is Because She Wants To Live As Freely And Bravely As She Believes Dara Does. She Goes Back To School, Realizing That Her Husband Is Conservative And Remote, That He Doesn't Talk About Things. But When He Does Try To Talk To Her, She Avoids Him. Their Conversations Are Impossibly Cryptic, As If Neither Of Them Believes The Other Is Reachable. No One In This Novel Seems To Believe In The Possibility Of Being Understood. <p>when Jean Finally Realizes That She Has Been Deceived By Dara, Her Fury Is Also Impossible To Believe, Because The Climactic Deception Is Such A Pathetic One. By Allowing Jean The Last Word On The Treacherous Dara, Beattie Skips Over The Fact That Sweet Jean Herself Is The Novel's Most Treacherous Character. She Leaves Her Best Friends And Her Husband, She Cruelly Rejects A Boy, The Son Of A Friend, She Fell Into Bed With One Day Trying To Avoid Visiting Her Husband. She Leaves Dara Only When Dara Is Finally Stripped Of All Pretense. But Beattie Shows No Insight Into Her Narrator's Deficiencies And There Is No One In This Novel To Like, Because There Is No One, Including The Author, Who Understands Its Protagonists Well Enough To Grow Fond Of Them. -- <i>salon</i></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/25/9780679781325.jpg,Success,141.0,21.2

But Jo Beth's life doesn't lend itself to leisure. Before the couple can leave for a picnic, a visitor arrives. Gilly Ainsley has a bizarre message for Jo Beth: a letter from Gilly's dead mother claiming that she was murdered by the man for whom she kept house - a superior court judge - and stating that Jo Beth would bring him to justice. Jo Beth has to rack her brain to remember Gilly's mother, whom she met once years before. But when it becomes clear that Gilly, too, is in danger, Jo Beth stops worrying and goes into action. Naturally Gilly will stay at the compound. Its security is first-rate due to the fact that Jo Beth's ex-husband, Bubba, a truly dangerous man with the reddest neck this side of the Mason-Dixon line, has been stalking her ever since his release from prison. It seems that Gilly's mother saw something she shouldn't have in the woods of the Okefenokee Swamp. But that place guards its secrets well, so finding out just what the judge is hiding there will have to wait. First a search-and-rescue call plunges Jo Beth, along with her best bloodhounds, into the dense, steaming, snake-and-gator-infested swamp looking for an abducted little boy. Then the town's first bank robbery in forty years gets everyone good and excited, especially a blind one-year-old bloodhound with long ears and a remarkable nose. And in the midst of it all, Jo Beth is devastated by a brutal reminder of just how hazardous it is to be her friend. Finally it is time for the judge. JoBeth knows that in a month of Sundays she'd never be able to nail His Honor for murder. But maybe, with a little luck and a lot of legwork, she'll uncover something of which he can be found guilty.",en,,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches",6.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/73/9780061010873.jpg,Success,105.0,21.2

She takes off overnight as Canada's new superpoet, pens lurid gothics on the sly, attracts a blackmailing reporter, skids cheerfully in and out of menacing plots, hair-raising traps, and passionate trysts, and lands dead and well in Terremoto, Italy. In this remarkable, poetic, and magical novel, Margaret Atwood proves yet again why she is considered to be one of the most important and accomplished writers of our time.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>If Atwood keeps a journal, perhaps some of the brief selections in this slender volume&#151;postmodern fairy tales, caustic fables, inspired parodies, witty monologues&#151;come from that source. The 35 entries offer a sometimes whimsical, sometimes sardonic view of the injustices of life and the battles of the sexes. Such updated fairy tales as ``The Little Red Hen Tells All'' (she's a victim of male chauvinism) and ``Making a Man'' (the Gingerbread man is the prototype) are seen with a cynical eye and told in pungent vernacular. ``Gertrude Talks Back'' is a monologue by Hamlet's mother, a randy woman ready for a roll in the hay, who is exasperated with her whiny, censorious teenage son. Several pieces feature women with diabolical intentions&#151;witches, malevolent goddesses, etc. There are science fiction scenarios, anthropomorphic confessionals (``My Life as a Bat''), and an indictment of overly aggressive women that out-Weldons Fay Weldon. While each of these entries is clever and sharply honed, readers will enjoy dipping into them selectively; a sustained reading may call up an excess of bile.

Ruth Puttermesser lives in New York City. Her learning is monumental. Her love life is minimal (she prefers pouring through Plato to romping with married Morris Rappoport). And her fantasies have a disconcerting tendency to come true - with disastrous consequences for what we laughably call ""reality.""
<p>Puttermesser yearns for a daughter and promptly creates one, unassisted, in the form of the first recorded female golem. Laboring in the dusty crevices of the civil service, she dreams of reforming the city - and manages to get herself elected mayor. Puttermesser contemplates the afterlife and is hurtled into it headlong, only to discover that a paradise found is also paradise lost.

Then Madison stumbles across the obit of an ex-football celebrity with whom she shared a single night five years ago and discovers that he died of AIDS. Ever responsible, Madison gets herself tested, and the result comes back HIV-positive the same day she accepts Charles's marriage proposal. Now this self-protective ""Lil Mama"" must question how much control any of us really have over our fates. With the honesty and perception she displayed in her first novel, Caught Up in the Rapture, Jackson explores the paradoxical way the shadow of death inspires one woman to open up and trust. It's a solid, unsentimental but uplifting tale with good characterization of fallible people caught in a terrible dilemma.

Focusing on Sacramento, California, at the dawn of the twentieth century, Sharon Ullman juxtaposes early cinema, vaudeville performances, and popular newspapers and magazines with insights drawn from close interpretations of transcripts from Sacramento court cases. She demonstrates how attitudes that emerged in the popular discourse—ideas about gender roles, female desire, prostitution, divorce, and homosexuality—often found complex and contradictory expression in the courts. As judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and juries all weighed in with differing opinions, the courtroom itself became a site of multiple discourses that attempted to make sense of a growing sexual chaos.<br>
In tracing the birth of modern sexuality, Ullman chronicles the dynamics of social change during a unique cultural moment and explains the shifts in the sexual ethos of turn-of-the-century America.<br>
<br>
Instead of telling the familiar story of steadily increasing liberation of sexual urges, Ullman chronicles the complex confusions and negotiations of an increasingly public sexual discourse. She relates how laws against cross-dressing gained force at the same time that female impersonation became popular in vaudeville acts, how images of prostitutes were changed by the commercialization of the female body in advertising and film, and how visible expression of female desire was submerged in rape and divorce proceedings.<br>
 Ullman blends social history, textual analysis, and film and performance criticism to explain how sexuality and desire became an essential part of personal identity in this century. Her keen, accessible account of a community on the brink of the modern era offers a provocative interpretation of the seeds of our sexual present.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.70106999316 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",25.87,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/58/9780520209558.jpg,Success,130.0,21.2

She was a sophisticated woman who owned a baseball team. She never shrank from going head to head with men, who dominated the ranks of sports executives and considered sports their exclusive domain. That her life story has remained unchronicled can only be attributed to one thing: her team, the Newark Eagles, belonged to the Negro Baseball League. This book furthers a growing awareness of black baseball before integration and profiles many of the other highly-competitive owners in the Negro league. It also describes a thriving black community in Newark that took the Newark Eagles into their hearts, creating a fascinating relationship between a community and their sports team. This book was the first to draw extensively on Eagle team records, left behind by Mrs. Manley when she left Newark in the 1950s, and rediscovered nearly intact thirty-five years later. The files are the most comprehensive source of information about the Newark Eagles. They reconstruct the relationship between the baseball team and the community to an extent never thought to be possible. Also included is material from Mrs. Manley's scrapbook chronicling her days as a baseball owner and an active home front volunteer during World War II. Her scrapbook is now part of the collection of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This important work shines the spotlight on a previously unsung segment of baseball history.

A third woman survived, cowering in a sea cave until dawn. More than a century later, Jean, a magazine photographer working on a photoessay about the murders, returns to the Isles with her husband, Thomas, and their five-year-old daughter, Billie, aboard a boat skippered by her brother-in-law, Rich, who has brought along his girlfriend, Adaline. As Jean becomes immersed in the details of the 19th-century murders, Thomas and Adaline find themselves drawn together-with potentially ruinous consequences. Shreve (<i>Where or When</i>; <i>Resistance</i>) perfectly captures the ubiquitous dampness of life on a sailboat, deftly evoking the way in which the weather comes to dictate all actions for those at sea. With the skill of a master shipbuilder, Shreve carefully fits her two stories together, tacking back and forth between the increasingly twisted murder mystery and the escalating tensions unleashed by the threat of a dangerous shipboard romance. Written with assurance and grace, plangent with foreboding and a taut sense of inexorability, <i>The Weight of Water</i> is a powerfully compelling tale of passion, a provocative and disturbing meditation on the nature of love.</p>",en,Movie Tie-In,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.625 Inches, Weight: 0.59 pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",15.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/77/9780316780377.jpg,Success,137.0,21.2

Had she been born a man, her reign would almost certainly have been remembered for its stable government, successful trade missions, and the construction of one of the most beautiful structures in the world-the Deir el-Bahri temple at Luxor. After her death, however, her name and image were viciously attacked, her monuments destroyed or usurped, her place in history systematically obliterated. At last, in this dazzling work of archaeological and historical sleuthing, Joyce Tyldesley rescues this intriguing figure from more than two thousand years of oblivion and finally restores the female pharaoh to her rightful prominence as the first woman in recorded history to rule a nation.</p>",en,New Ed,"Height: 7.81 Inches, Length: 5.09 Inches, Weight: 0.46958461806 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",18.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/49/9780140244649.jpg,Success,139.0,21.2

Alicia Gaspar de Alba looks at the exhibit as a cultural text in which the Chicano/a community affirmed itself not as a ""subculture"" within the U.S. but as an ""alter-Native"" culture in opposition to the exclusionary and homogenizing practices of mainstream institutions. She also shows how the exhibit reflected the cultural and sexual politics of the Chicano Movement and how it serves as a model of Chicano/a popular culture more generally.<p>Drawing insights from cultural studies, feminist theory, anthropology, and semiotics, this book constitutes a wide-ranging analysis of Chicano/a art, popular culture, and mainstream cultural politics.

It shows how the ecology movement has been held back by conceptual confusion over the implications of gender difference, while much that passes in the name of feminism is actually an obstacle to ecological change and global democracy. The author argues that ecofeminism reaches beyond contemporary social movements being a political synthesis of four revolutions in one: ecology is feminism is socialism is post-colonial struggle.</p>
<p>Informed by a critical postmodern reading of the Marxist tradition, Salleh's ecofeminism integrates discourses on science, the body, culture, nature, political economy. The book opens with a short history of the ecofeminism. Part two establishes the basis for its epistemological challenge while the third part consists of ecofeminist deconstructions of deep ecology, social ecology, eco-socialism and postmodern feminism. In the final section, Salleh suggests that a powerful way forward can be found in commonalities between ecofeminist and indigenous struggles.</p>",en,,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.34 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",247.51,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/07/9781856494007.jpg,Success,122.0,21.2

Eventually, more than 1,000 women served their country as Women's Airforce Service Pilots. These women were much more than subs -- they flew B-26s when men were afraid to, flew every aircraft in the inventory of the U.S. Army Air Force, and logged over six million miles in all kinds of weather. Led by the famous aviatrix Jacqueline Cochran, these forgotten women were superb pilots, the equals of any fighter jock. In 1961, Dr. Randolph Lovelace, a member of NASA's Life Sciences Committee, invited 13 women to participate in what he termed a 'Women in Space' program. The women were given cause to hope that NASA would allow at least one of them to fly as an astronaut. The matter went as far as Congress, where it was debated in two days of dramatic hearings that included testimony from astronauts John Glenn and Scott Carpenter. Unfortunately, although these women had the right stuff, it was the wrong time for women in space. This is a story of dreams fulfilled and dreams deferred, a story of fierce patriotism, courage, and heartbreak, and a story of two generations of women aviators who have too long been forgotten.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",24.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/38/9780688152338.jpg,Success,137.0,21.2

But when she opened her eyes, no one noticed. Her entire body paralyzed by stroke, she tried to speak and no one heard. Thus her nightmare began. Gradually, Julia Tavalaro realized that not one of her doctors or caretakers was prepared to consider the possibility that the vital mind of a thirty-two-year-old woman existed inside the tiny, twisted body before them. Warehoused in a public hospital with other ""incurables,"" she was known to all as ""the vegetable."" While she lay there, the Vietnam War raged and waned, a man walked on the moon, and an actor she knew from B-movies was elected president. In this vivid and moving memoir, Julia recounts her years in the prison of her body - the physical and emotional suffering and the realization that she had been abandoned by her family. Nearly broken by recurring bouts of pneumonia and fevers, and by the cruel and often abusive nurses who hated assuming responsibility for her life, Julia began to fight back. She unleashed a powerful rage, a biting, moaning, spitting offensive against those who expected little more from her than the sound of her breathing. Finally, in 1973, a young speech therapist named Arlene Kraat suspected Julia could comprehend what was happening around her. By asking her one simple question and telling her to respond with her eyes, she finally broke through Julia's isolation. With Arlene pointing to each letter on a letter board, Julia began to use her eyes to spell out her thoughts and relate the turmoil of her terrible years in captivity. Eventually, she began to compose poems that drew on the memories of her life before the stroke, reviving the aggressively sexual, daredevil life she had once lived and re-establishing her own sanity.

                        <p>""Dismissed as a 'vegetable' by hospital staff, the author, who awoke from a coma without mobility or speech, shares her harrowing experience in an intelligent and powerful voice.""

Instead, educators have learned that youth play active roles in shaping who they are on a daily basis, challenging dominant meanings and practices as they move through school. New insights in these directions now compel those in educational circles to talk differently about youth identity formation than they did nearly two decades ago. While sound research on male identity formation in educational contexts has illustrated boys' socialization processes in school, there still is much to learn about girls' social lives and meaning-making processes, particularly in the relatively unexplored arenas of private education and single-sex schooling.
<p>Probing beneath the surface, this book explores one year in the lives of thirty-four adolescent girls in Best Academy, a historically elite, private, single-sex high school, as female students construct their identities in an educational context. Through the eyes of these students, we find that the private school is less of a homogenous and stable culture along class and race lines than educators have understood it to be.</p>",en,No Edition Stated,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.93916923612 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/28/9780791437728.jpg,Success,130.0,21.2

<p>Americans have become so accustomed to following doctors' orders that many prescriptions, medical tests, and surgical procedures are accepted without question. This blind faith can be dangerous! Modern medicine offers us a wide range of powerful treatments for ailments large and small. But did you know that some common ""cures"" come with serious, life-threatening risks, or may do nothing at all?</p>
<p>SOME STARTLING FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW:<br>
Cholesterol-lowering medications can actually increase your chances of dying.<br>
The rise in asthma deaths may be linked to high-strength inhalers.<br>
In many cases, it's safer to do nothing than have surgery for prostate cancer.<br>
Steroids, now widely prescribed for many minor conditions, can cause immediate, permanent,- debilitating damage.<br>
Bone scans to screen for osteoporosis are imprecise, often inaccurate, and may not signify anything.<br>
In the overwhelming majority of cases, antibiotics are prescribed for conditions they cannot treat.<br>
Ritalin, taken by as many as a million American children, has questionable benefits, numerous side effects, and a high potential for addiction or abuse.<br>
The U.S. National Institutes of Health estimates that 90% of patients who undergo bypass surgery receive almost no benefits.<br>
And much more vital information you need to know—before you see your doctor.</p>

Fat—A Fate Worse Than Death? offers hardy resistance to the narrow, random, and irrational appearance standards set for American women through an approach that is personal, eclectic, courageous, and funny. If you are interested in giving up your diet, throwing out your scales, and concentrating on who you are on a deeper level, this book will show you how to accept, appreciate, and even love your body!</p>
<p>Using statistics, research, anecdotes, and personal experiences, Fat—A Fate Worse Than Death? explores how appearance standards have built a prison for women. With the book’s helpful advice, reading suggestions, and list of more than 100 ways to fight looksism, sexism, ageism, and racism, you will learn to express your rights and needs, regardless of your shape or size, and tear down those prison walls. Designed to transcend the boundaries between the personal and the political, Fat—A Fate Worse Than Death? discusses:</p>
<ul>
<li>examples of how weight and size constitute the last socially accepted prejudice</li>
<li>the national “War on Fat”</li>
<li>counteracting societal influences that support weight preoccupation</li>
<li>connection between appearance standards for older women and large women</li>
<li>nurturing your body</li>
<li>resisting male-defined standards of beauty for women</li>
<li>the myth of diets and dieting</li>
<li>how the body resists weight loss</li>
<li>how women are disempowered by concentration on weight and appearance</li>
<li>how concentrating on appearance leaves real-life issues unaddressed</li>
<li>how feeling bad about yourself can turn you into a willing consumer
<p>Feminists, faculty and students of women’s studies programs, aging women, women of radical politics, and other concerned women and men will find that Fat—A Fate Worse Than Death? states explicitly how women are kept powerless by subscribing to cultural and social edicts on physical appearance. Don’t live silently in a society that degrades and discounts women because of their physical stature and don‘t let obsession with thinness keep you passive, docile, and unable to give your energy to things that really need your passion and intelligence. Read this book and learn to not only value yourself for who you are, but also to counteract American culture’s equality-denying prejudices and practices.</p>

Freedman draws from Van Waters's diaries, letters, and personal papers to recreate her complex personal life, unveiling the disparity between Van Waters's public persona and her agonized private soul. With the power and elegance of a novel, <i>Maternal Justice</i> illuminates this historical context, casting light on the social welfare tradition, on women's history, on the American feminist movement, and on the history of sexuality.<br><br>""<i>Maternal Justice</i> is as much a work of history as it is biography, bringing to life not only a remarkable woman but also the complex political and social milieu within which she worked and lived.""&#8212;Kelleher Jewett, <i>The Nation</i><br><br>""This sympathetic biography reclaims Van Waters for history.""&#8212;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>""The Van Waters legacy, as Freedman gracefully presents, is that she cared about the lives of women behind bars. It is a strikingly unfashionable sentiment today.""&#8212;Jane Meredith Adams, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i>, Editor's Recommended Selection<br><br>""This finely crafted biography is both an engrossing read and a richly complicated account of a reformer whose work . . . bridged the eras of voluntarist charitable activism and professional social service.""&#8212;SherriBroder, <i>Women's Review of Books</i><br><br>""This is a sympathetic, highly personal biography, revealing of both the author's responses to her subject's life and, in considerable detail, Van Waters's family traumas, illnesses, and love affairs.""&#8212;Elizabeth Israels Perry, <i>Journal of American History</i></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In her biography of Miriam Van Waters, an obscure Massachusetts prison reformer, Stanford history professor Freedman rescues her subject from obscurity and uncovers a life story representative of a cohort of women. The daughter of an Episcopal minister, Van Waters believed in individual and cultural transformation through good works. Add to that her advanced education (she earned a doctorate in 1913) and a personal and political inheritance that maintained the power of maternal nurture, and you have the formula for the ""new woman"" turned ""municipal housekeeper."" Freedman recounts all the requisite themes: a conflict between a buoyant public image and a deep private insecurity; administrative travails that came with newfound authority; the painful lessons of playing politics with the big boys; and the family of women that nurtured and sustained her. Freedman's attention to this classic set of concerns makes Van Waters's ouster from her position as superintendent of the Massachusetts Reformatory for Women in 1949 an almost inevitable, epic climax. A failure, a loss and a betrayal, followed by a struggle for vindication, that crisis colors every strand and strain of Van Waters's life. Freedman's poised and accomplished book may sacrifice some of her subject's originality-she appears, at times, to be living a plot line-but this sympathetic biography reclaims Van Waters for history.

But Ingrid's young life is shattered when this affectionate, violent man who learned to kill in Vietnam abandons her and her beautiful young mother in the wake of a violent crime. <P>That is the day an essential truth vanishes from Ingrid's life. Fleeing to a small mountain community, Ingrid grows up in isolation and learns not to ask questions when her mother takes up with a string of faceless men.

But it is with Enoch Skaggs, the charismatic leader of a murderous satanic cult, that Ingrid reaches the depths of degradation -- and witnesses something she shouldn't have seen. Yet it is in her blackest moment of despair -- when she is marked for death -- that Ingrid finds unexpected salvation ... and the will to reclaim her life and her heart again.</p><h3>NY Times Book Review</h3><p>What keeps us coming back to Oates Country is her uncanny gift of making the page a window, with something happening on the other side that we'd swear was life itself.</p>",en,First Thus,"Height: 7.92 Inches, Length: 5.33 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",15.4,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/43/9780452277243.jpg,Success,139.0,21.2
