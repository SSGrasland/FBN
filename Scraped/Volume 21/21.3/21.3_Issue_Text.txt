ÉÉ The most important thing to happen to
the lesbian community — ever. 55
— Marj Plumb, Gay and Lesbian Medical Association
What are the unique health issues for lesbians?
Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health
problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases,
breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance
abuse? How does homophobia affect the funding
of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian
health needs fit into the current health care system?
Lesbian Health takes a frank look at the political
pressures, community attitudes, and professional
concerns uniquely affecting the study of lesbian
health issues. The book explores many other issues
and offers a closer look at this important topic.

Young Women Write About Body Image and Identity
edited by Ophira Edut $ foreword by Rebecca Walker
“Adiós, Barbie is not just another anti-beauty diatribe. It’s about the cool,
funky, ingenious ways that young women are using our bodies as weapons

depending on our race, ethnicity, sexuality, size or ability, women can
find endless ways in which our bodies don’t measure up. In Adiós, Barbie
more than twenty-five young women turn modern culture’s feminine
ideal on its head by ignoring, subverting or redefining the dominant
beauty standard. In doing so, they create a more compelling and realistic
picture of body image and young women.

FALLEN FROM GRACE A Helen Black Mystery
by Pat Welch
When downsized corporate executive and closeted lesbian Leslie Merrick
takes a nose dive from an eighth-story window, the cops jump to the conclu-
sion that her death is a suicide. Hired by the dead woman's mother to clear
her daughter’s reputation, Berkeley PI Helen Black discovers that the
multinational conglomerate Merrick worked for is rife with political patronage,
corporate treachery, sexual harassment, disgruntled employees, vindictive co-
workers, and mysterious “vacations”. Although fallout from the investigation
quickly puts the private eye at odds with everyone from her new lover to her
former police partner, she uncovers nothing to indicate that Merrick’s death
was anything but self-inflicted. Could the woman's fall have been accidental?
Or is Helen Black being set up to take the biggest fall of all?

ENDLESS LOVE
by Lisa Shapiro
at Welc Writer Andrea Stern is trying to rebuild
her life after a devastating tragedy that left
her grief-stricken and emotionally deadened. She returns home in an effort to
reconnect with her family, but dealing with her disapproving mother,
unexpressive father, and mentally ill sister only deepens her emotional void.
Andrea teeters dangerously on the edge of despair . . . until she meets Gwen
Severence — a woman whose strength and caring will challenge her to make
peace with the past. A woman who will teach her to live with hope instead of
fear . . . and to believe, once again, that love can be forever.
Lisa Shapiro shares a home in New
Hampshire with Lynne D'Orsay, her
cherished and honest lover of ten years. Her

BAD MOON RISING
A Colleen Fitzgerald Mystery
by Barbara Johnson
A bad moon rises over a desolate world. A tawdry world of fast money, mind-
numbing highs, and gut-wrenching lows. Where a rising star can burn hotter
than the spotlights on the set ... and be extinguished just as quickly. Where
the end of a needle can mean the end of the line ...
When porn star Amber Rose is found dead from an apparent overdose, the
routine case turns increasingly ugly as Insurance Investigator Colleen
Fitzgerald delves deeply into the seamy netherworld of the sex industry.
In the heat of the investigation, Colleen’s discovery of a dark secret in her
lover Gillian’s past seriously strains their relationship. And darkly handsome
attorney Jenna Bolden is more than happy to ease the strain ..….

Closed in Silence Spinster
oan Drur
se ISBN: 1-883523-29-X $10.95 (Pub. date: September 1998)
Once again, Joan Drury, creator of the award-winning Tyler Jones
i N feminist mystery series, stretches the traditional mystery genre with
another novel that breaks silences, allowing women's voices to be
heard. While celebrating a reunion with her five close college pals on
an isolated island in Puget Sound, Tyler discovers a body. In pursuit of
a murderer that may be one of them, the six women share their stories
_ of struggle, triumph, accomplishment, and pain, thus opening the circle
that keeps women mute, separate from one another, “closed in silence.”
“Joan Drury's follow-up to her Edgar Award finalist, Silent Words,
offers further proof: she's one of our best. This atmospheric, absorbing,
passionately feminist novel will reward you with fine characterizations
(a Drury trademark), a storm-tossed setting, and a most mysterious
mystery.” — Katherine V. Forrest, author, Apparition Alley
A Woman Determined
Jean Swallow
ISBN 1-883523-28-1 $10.95 (Pub. date: October 1998)
The multi-layered novel of how an automobile accident profoundly
transforms the lives of two women: the accident victim and her
attorney. As the two women later recall, in parallel narratives, their
search for justice, their personal stories become intertwined with the
history of a close-knit lesbian community, its members, and institutions.
Ultimately, this is a story of hope—of how two women possessed with
uncommon determination reach deep within themselves to find the truths
of their lives, the reality they can and need to embrace. By the author of
Leave A Light On For Me and Out From Under: Sober Dykes and
