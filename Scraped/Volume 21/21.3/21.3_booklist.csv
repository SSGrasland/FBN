Rachel Waltner Goossen tells the story of these women against the good war, women who identified themselves as conscientious objectors. Despite cultural hostility and discriminatory federal policies, they sought to demonstrate their humanitarian convictions by taking part in Civilian Public Service work. Based on little-known archival sources as well as oral history interviews and questionnaire responses, Goossen's study reveals the extent to which these women's religious and philosophical beliefs placed them on the margins of American society. Encouraged by religious traditions that prized nonconformity, these women made unusual choices, questioned government dictums, and defied societal expectations; all of which set them apart from the millions of Americans who supported the war effort.",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches",8.49,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/68/9780807823668.jpg,Success,15,21.3

We are taught to think of Islam as a culture wherein social code and religious law alike force women to accept male authority and surrender to the veil. How could feminism emerge under such a code, let alone flourish? Now, traveling throughout Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as Islamic communities in the United States, acclaimed Arab Studies scholar and bestselling author Elizabeth Fernea sets out to answer that question.
<p>Fernea's dialogue with friends, colleagues, and acquaintances prompts a range of diverse and unpredictable responses, but in every country she visits, women demonstrate they are anything but passive. In Iraq, we see an 85 percent literacy rate among women; in Egypt, we see women owning their own farms; and in Israel, we see women at the very forefront of peacemaking efforts. Poor or rich, educated or illiterate, these women define their own needs, solve their own problems, and determine the boundaries of their own very real, very viable feminism. <i>In Search of Islamic Feminism</i> offers a groundbreaking new interpretation of the status and vision of Muslim women that will open up a new world to its readers, even as it challenges our own sense of what feminism means.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8377565956 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",17,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/87/9780385488587.jpg,Success,122,21.3

Ellen Douglas has taken this very much to heart and has sought the truth in a region beyond falsehood; through falsehood, in effect. It's a fascinating performance. -- Shelby Foote<P> Now that she has outlived those who might have objected to her telling four family secrets, Ellen Douglas does just that.<P> A novelist revered for her storytelling, here she crosses over into the mirror world of historical fact to tell four stories in which she seeks the truth--about herself, about her white Mississippi forebears, about their relationships to black Mississippians, and ultimately, about their guilt as murderers of helpless slaves. In collection, they make a book its author describes as ""about remembering and forgetting, seeing and ignoring, lying and truth-telling. It's about secrets, judgements, threats, danger, and willful amnesia. It's about the truth in fiction and the fiction in 'truth.'""<P> Josephine Haxton, who took the pseudonym Ellen Douglas in 1962 to protect her family's privacy upon publication of her first novel, is the author of seven previous books, all fiction. Two of them, A Family's Affair and Black Cloud, White Cloud were both included in the New York Times Book Review's Year's Ten Best listings. Her fourth novel, Apostles of Light, was a finalist for the National Book Award. At seventy-seven, Douglas has won respect as a novelist who dared to chip away at the wall blocking communication between Southern Whites and blacks.<P> Now she turns her extraordinary powers of observation directly onto events that involve her own blocked communications and thestruggle to make sense of them. The result is perhaps this complex and important writer's most complex and important work. As USA Today has said of her work, ""Racism is not simply a failure to understand others, Douglas suggests, but most profoundly a failure to understand one's own condition.

She unmasks the effects of sexism on both men and women and describes a spirituality that makes healthier, happier human beings of us all.</p> <p>According to Chittister, the patriarchal culture that has shaped our world has also brought us to the edge of destruction with its dualisms, hierarchies, and inequality. She outlines the historical realities that produced this situation and describes how patriarchal culture and spirituality maintain their hold on us. She then argues that there is another way which is better and introduces us to a feminist worldview that, in recognizing the full humanity of women, leads all of us to new, better ways of being and relating.</p> <p><I>Heart of Flesh&#58; A Feminist Spirituality for Women and Men</I> offers a dynamic vision of spirituality from one of our finest writers of spiritual literature.</p></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>A noted author, lecturer, and Benedictine nun, Chittister considers feminist spirituality to be the true essence and full potential of Christianity. Analyzing the history of patriarchal thinking, she shows how its tendency toward violence, authoritarian domination, and dualistic theology diminishes both women and men. The feminist spirituality she envisions is modeled after the radical example of Jesus, whose human vulnerability and compassion gave him strength to love the sick, the poor, and society's outcasts equally and to resist evil and injustice without violence. Chittister writes with a rare blend of accessible scholarship and impassioned eloquence.

Now, in her new book, Dodson provides 100 recommendations for inspired reading for girls. Each book entry is comprehensive, giving parents ideas for discussion questions and activities that will ultimately encourage reading and enhance the time they spend with their children.</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>In this helpful and inspirational resource, author Dodson (The Mother-Daughter Book Club [HarperPerennial, 1997]) summarizes one hundred books that girls ages nine to thirteen might enjoy reading on their own or sharing in a book discussion group. Librarians, educators, and parents will find hundreds of ideas on how to use both the classic and current fiction selections in their libraries, classrooms, and homes, from Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (Blakiston, 1943) to Jerry Spinelli's Wringer (HarperCollins, 1997). Organized alphabetically by title, each book is broken down into several categories including the summary, reading time, themes, discussion questions, information about the author, activities to do beyond the book, and recommended further reading. The discussion questions are thought-provoking and original, and will generate much discussion if used in a group. While reading time varies for each individual reader, the times Dodson approximates are quite accurate for the average enthusiastic reader. The information provided about each author is a short combination of interesting career and personal information, some of which may inspire many readers to do more research if they enjoy the book. Activities described to extend the reader's experience beyond the book are not always practical for librarians to do but can often be adapted and will generate many other ideas for crafts, games, research, and food options. This excellent tool is just right for anyone thinking of starting a book discussion group, energizing an existing book group, or looking to expand a readers' advisory collection. Index.

0-8203-2078-1,An Un-American Childhood,"Kimmage, Ann",University of Georgia Press,288,10/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p><i>An Un-American Childhood</i> is the thoughtful memoir of Ann Kimmage's experiences as a child and young woman in communist Czechoslovakia and China. In 1950, while McCarthyism reigned in America, Kimmage's parents, Abe and Belle Chapman, were active, loyal members of the American Communist Party. Her family lived in Queens, New York, until they were forced underground, illegally fleeing first to Mexico and ultimately Prague, Czechoslovakia, which at the time was in the early stages of its communist revolution. There, the Chapmans became the Capeks—a mystery to their new neighbors, but Czech citizens nonetheless. What Kimmage had at first been led to believe was a brief sojourn became a transforming, thirteen-year journey.</p>
<p>Informative and passionate, <i>An Un-American Childhood</i> provides a unique perspective on the lives of American communist expatriates. Kimmage dramatizes her family's struggle to integrate into a new society and simultaneously maintain their unity and identity. Kimmage and her sister had little choice but to completely adopt Czech language and culture as their own, which created a rift between them and their parents, who were unwilling or unable to do the same.</p>
<p><i>An Un-American Childhood</i> also opens up a personal perspective on the international communist community. Set primarily in Prague, the memoir also recalls a two-year stay in Beijing and visits to such places as East Berlin and Moscow. Kimmage's accounts of her schooling and involvement in social organizations such as the Young Pioneers tell of her exposure to Marxist ideology and morality. However, for her, Kimmage says, life was always less politics than it was culture, language, and relationships.</p>
<p>Ending with their disillusioned return to the United States, the Chapman family's saga presents an intriguing mix of political events and personal reactions. <i>An Un-American Childhood</i> tells of a family twice torn from its cultural roots, and tried, tested, and changed by and for its beliefs.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.999982 Inches, Length: 5.499989 Inches, Weight: 0.9700339528 Pounds, Width: 0.80999838 Inches",10.93,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/86/9780820320786.jpg,Success,116,21.3

1-56924-743-9,Spunk: Selected Short Stories,Hurston,Da Capo Press,128,12/30/1997,,Paperback,"Zora Neale Hurston is a literary legend. One of the leading forces of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston was also one of the most widely acclaimed Black authors in America from the mid twenties to the mid forties. She faded into obscurity in the subsequent decades, but literary figures and scholars in the 1970s revived her work and introduced a whole generation to her brilliance. Today she is the most widely taught Black woman writer in the canon of American literature. Born in the all-Black town of Eatonville, Florida, of which her father was mayor, Hurston was intensely proud. She became the first Black student at Barnard College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology. She conducted significant research, interviews, and fieldwork relating to Black cultures of the United States and the Caribbean. In her writings, instead of bemoaning the frustrations of the Black experience, Hurston chose to celebrate the many cultures of her people as well as the richness of their verbal expressions. Although Hurston died poor and forgotten in 1960, the visibility of the feminist movement and the interest of women writers such as Alice Walker - who was responsible for providing a headstone for Hurston's unmarked grave in 1974 - were instrumental in reestablishing Hurston's place in African-American literature. Hurston's life and work are revealed through the reviews and essays contained in Zora Neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past and Present. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and K. A. Appiah have chosen reviews of her works from such important publications of her days as The Crisis, New Masses, New Republic, the New York Herald Tribune, The New York Times Book Review, Opportunity, and Saturday Review of Literature. Hurston's first novel, Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934), earned comments ranging from ""most vital"" to ""a disappointment,"" although the reviewers consistently praised her use of dialect and language.

<p>In ten vital, compelling chapters, Dr. Laura speaks her mind on:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Stupid Chivalry</b><br>
 By getting involved with the wrong woman (weak, flaky, damaged, needy, desperate, stupid, untrustworthy, immature, etc.) you think that your love will save/transform her.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Independence</b><br>
 Unwilling to admit ""need"" for bonding and intimacy, you hide in excesses of work, play, drink, drugs, porn, and meaningless sex.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Ambition</b><br>
 Unable to comfortably and proudly accept your inherent importance to society and family as husband and father, you bow to the false idols of money, toys, power, and status.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Strength</b><br>
Uncomfortable with feeling weak, vulnerable, useless, powerless, or rejected, you use intimidation, force, or passive-aggressiveness to regain control.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Sex</b><br>
Taking an attraction, opportunity, or erection as a ""sign,"" you measure your masculinity and power by sexual conquests, infidelities, and orgasms.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Matrimony</b><br>
Lacking a mature sense of the purpose, meaning, or value of marriage, you realize too late you've gone down the aisle with the wrong woman for the wrong reasons and feel helpless to ""fix it.""</li>
<li><b>Stupid Husbanding</b><br>
Thinking that marriage is the honorable discharge from loving courtship, you continue to live as though you were single and your ""mommy-wife"" will take care of everything else.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Parenting</b><br>
Believing that only women/mothers nurture children, you withdraw from hands-on parenting to assert your masculine importance, missing out on the true ""soul food"" of a child's hug.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Boyishness</b><br>
Having not yet worked out a comfortable emotional and social understanding with your mother, you form relationships with women that become geared to avenge, resolve, or protect you from your ties to Mommy.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Machismo</b><br>
Understanding the true and meaningful difference between being male and a man, you can become a man.</li>

Hannah, wife and mother of two teenagers, vacationing with her husband Lyle in New York, wakes up in the middle of the night and looks at the man sleeping in the bed next to her and screams. She does not remember who she is, who Lyle is, how she got there, and finally, how to speak.

The high-pressure world we live in, with its emphasis on material goods, has eclipsed the timeless values of commitment and spirituality. Today success is measured not by what we are, but by what we possess: the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the trinkets we buy. 
<p>As a result, more and more people live with self-doubt, depression, ennui, and familial dysfunction. Relationships are stalled. Personal growth seems unattainable. In the end, the things we buy offer us no comfort. We grow old, lonely, and afraid, wondering how we could have done it differently.</p>
<p><i>The Committed Life</i> teaches us a better way. Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis has been reaching out to people and helping others find happiness her entire life. By age six she was smuggling food and messages into Nazi detention camps during World War II, thereby learning her first lesson of the Torah: ""You shall not stand idly by while the life of your brother is in jeopardy."" Today she is a dynamic and inspiring leader who has devoted her life to combating the spiritual wasteland surrounding us.</p>
<p>The Rebbetzin knows that many of us are in trouble. She has heard countless cries for help escaping the emotional vacuums that have become our lives. Twenty-five years ago, she founded Hineni Hebrew for ""Here I am"", an outreach organization that has ignited the hearts and minds of people throughout the world. Her popular classes, based on the teachings of the Torah and focused on what is truly important in life, draw thousands every week.</p>
<p>Filled with wisdom as timeless as the Torah itself, <i>The Committed Life</i> is for anyoneeager to connect with ancient wellsprings of faith. Each chapter offers its own riveting lesson on such pivotal subjects as responsibility, forgiving, banishing fear, gratitude, anger, commitment to marriage, depression, faith, and hope. This is a book that you will want to keep on your bookshelf and pick up again and again for help dealing with the many restrictions of daily living.</p>
<p>Written with the Rebbetzin's rare combination of honesty, love, and chutzpah, the stories here are universal and yet so deeply personal that reading them is like having her speak to you in your own home. This inspirational guide will give you the sustenance you need to lead a more fulfilling and committed life.</p>
<p>Drawing on the timeless wisdom of the Torah, Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis reminds us of the principles necessary for living a better and more committed life:</p>
<p>Commitment</p>
<p>Inviting G-D Into Your Life Responsibility/Accountability Charity—Tzedukah</p>
<p>Prayer</p>
<p>Forgiveness Banishing Fear</p>
<p>Compassion</p>
<p>Faith</p>
<p>Hope Gratitude</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>Gaining Control Over Yourself</p>
<p>Committing To Marriage the Sabbath</p>
<p>Creating A Family the Legacy Of Grandparents</p>
<p>""A Long Life is not good enough, but a good life is long enough.""</p>
<p>""Let me share with you the formula our sages proposed for change and personal growth. `A man,' they teach, `is shaped by his <i>deeds</i> and <i>actions</i>' [<i>Sefer Ha Chinuch</i>, The Book of Education]. Now this may not sound like such a revolutionary idea, but it is diametrically opposed to that which our secular world believes—that it is our thoughts and convictions that mold and make us what we are...The mind is tricky, capable of rationalizing, playing games with ideas that the heart finds too demanding or too restrictive, and so <i>Sefer Ha Chinuch</i> advises us to bypass the cerebral, concentrate on our deeds and actions, and just do what we have to do. Through that doing, our personalities, our character traits, will be reshaped and molded until one day we will discover that we have become the new beings that we had hoped to become, that we are connecting to that goodness in our souls, and that we are on our way to fulfilling our mission in life.""<br>

As such, she has served as a model and inspiration for women from all the Buddhist traditions who have sought to revive the practice of women's monasticism in modern times. Though her renown as a teacher is widespread, few know the truly amazing details of her life before her monastic ordination at the age of fifty-eight. And what a life it was. Born Ilse Kussel in Berlin, Germany, she grew up in a prosperous Jewish family that was broken up by Nazi terror in 1938. The story of her escape alone to Scotland, and her journey to rejoin her family in China, would be enough for a thrilling adventure novel in itself—but it is only the beginning of the story. Her later adventures included—but were not limited to—surviving the Japanese invasion of China; living the life of a suburban housewife in Los Angeles, California; journeying up the Amazon; studying in a Bolivian university; building a power plant in Pakistan; and establishing the first organic farm in Australia. Her Buddhist practice was a result of a pursuit of the spiritual life that began in her forties when she encountered spiritual teachers in India. She eventually founded a monastery in Sri Lanka, from where, through her books, and her teaching travels, she became one of the most widely respected of contemporary teachers, particularly skilled in interpreting the Buddhist teachings for her fellow Westerners.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.8 Inches, Length: 5.77 Inches, Weight: 1.0625 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/55/9781570624155.jpg,Success,133,21.3

That debate led to ground-breaking court decisions and major shifts in corporate policies that have had a profound effect on our lives—and on Anita Hill's life. Now, with remarkable insight and total candor, Anita Hill reflects on events before, during, and after the hearings, offering for the first time a complete account that sheds startling new light on this watershed event.</p>
<p>Only after reading her moving recollection of her childhood on her family's Oklahoma farm can we fully appreciate the values that enabled her to withstand the harsh scrutiny she endured during the hearings and for years afterward. Only after reading her detailed narrative of the Senate Judiciary proceedings do we reach a new understanding of how Washington—and the media—rush to judgment. And only after discovering the personal toll of this wrenching ordeal, and how Hill copes, do we gain new respect for this extraordinary woman.</p>

Here, Julie Roy Jeffrey explores the involvement of ordinary women—black and white—in the most significant reform movement prior to the Civil War. She offers a complex and compelling portrait of antebellum women's activism, tracing its changing contours over time.
<p>For more than three decades, women raised money, carried petitions, created propaganda, sponsored lecture series, circulated newspapers, supported third-party movements, became public lecturers, and assisted fugitive slaves. Indeed, Jeffrey says, theirs was the day-to-day work that helped to keep abolitionism alive. Drawing from letters, diaries, and institutional records, she uses the words of ordinary women to illuminate the meaning of abolitionism in their lives, the rewards and challenges that their commitment provided, and the anguished personal and public steps that abolitionism sometimes demanded they take. Whatever their position on women's rights, argues Jeffrey, their abolitionist activism was a radical step—one that challenged the political and social status quo as well as conventional gender norms.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/68/9780807824368.jpg,Success,15,21.3

Here, Julie Roy Jeffrey explores the involvement of ordinary women-black and white-in the most significant reform movement prior to the Civil War. She offers a complex and compelling portrait of antebellum women's activism, tracing its changing contours over time.</p><p>For more than three decades, women raised money, carried petitions, created propaganda, sponsored lecture series, circulated newspapers, supported third-party movements, became public lecturers, and assisted fugitive slaves. Indeed, Jeffrey says, theirs was the day-to-day work that helped to keep abolitionism alive. Drawing from letters, diaries, and institutional records, she uses the words of ordinary women to illuminate the meaning of abolitionism in their lives, the rewards and challenges that their commitment provided, and the anguished personal and public steps that abolitionism sometimes demanded they take. Whatever their position on women's rights, argues Jeffrey, their abolitionist activism was a radical step-one that challenged the political and social status quo as well as conventional gender norms.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.0361726314 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches",23.51,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/11/9780807847411.jpg,Success,15,21.3

Well, she's back -- and she has a story to tell.</p>
<p><i>Little Sisters</i> explores in depth what it is like to be the youngest, shortest female in a household. These are the women who, as children, had to go to bed first -- when everyone else in the family was up having <i>fun</i>. They learned rebellion early; becoming the ""good girl"" or perhaps a ""wild one,"" whatever the family needed. Many of them endured years of torture from their older siblings whose ""larger and moremature muscles make them eager oppressors."" So says author, journalist, and little sister Carolyn Lieberg, in her playful, informative, and sometimes touching look at the women whose mantra is ""I'll catch up no matter what.""</p>
<p>Interviews with grown-up little sisters yielded stories, insights, and experiences that will ring true with youngest siblings everywhere. Lieberg examines the hotly debated topic of birth order psychology and reveals previously little-known or generally ignored facts about little sisters. They <i>are</i> more popular in school; and studies show that little sisters tend to be radical thinkers and rebellious by nature -- more inclined to create a new system rahter than working to improve it -- something they cheerfully attest to. Drawing from examples in scientific research, personal experience, and literature, <i>Little Sisters</i> eloquently supports (or irreverently disagrees with) a number of theories and truisms. The author finds common characteristics and peculiarities among little sisters but also recognizes their wide-ranging personalities and ambitions.</p>
<p>Little sisters will know why this book is important. For olders siblings, reading this book will help to make up for all that bad behavior many years ago.</p>",en,,"Height: 7 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.46517537282 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/45/9781885171245.jpg,Success,13,21.3

Anna Lee Stone), a reclusive writer who narrates this tale of murder, water rights, and deadly designer drugs; and Caroline Marcus (a.k.a. Cordelia Morgan), a shadowy international ""hit artist"" working for a private ""contracting"" firm called The Company. Set in rural New Mexico, <i>The Woman Who Knew Too Much</i> has a strong feminist bent and lesbian subtext, and tackles issues of environmentalism and corporate corruption, as well as personal integrity and history.
<p>Jet Butler has lived on an isolated mesa for more than 30 years since writing a feminist bestseller back in the '60s -- an infamous book that indirectly caused the deaths of 67 women living in a commune during a botched FBI raid. As the novel opens, Jet is trying to help a friend who's the prime suspect in a local murder investigation. In the course of her investigation, she stumbles across an old man living in the New Mexico outback, a former chemist experimenting with a substance called Plastosterone, a synthetic testosterone being developed as a new designer drug with some particularly nasty side effects.</p>
<p>Enter Cord Morgan. She's the ace ""specialist"" at The Company, but a few years past the the ten-year maximum prescribed for this high-stress line of work. Although she's a genius of disguise and deception, The Company senses the beginning of a crack or two and gives Morgan a little time off, an easy ""vacation"" assignment in New Mexico -- which, of course, turns out to be anything but.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.77382253962 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/55/9781573440455.jpg,Success,81,21.3

But that is only a small part of its complicated and complicit performance history.<br>
In this sophisticated and historically grounded analysis, anthropologist Jennifer Robertson draws from over a decade of fieldwork and archival research to explore how the Revue illuminates discourses of sexual politics, nationalism, imperialism, and popular culture in twentieth-century Japan.<br>
The Revue was founded in 1913 as a novel counterpart to the all-male Kabuki theater. Tracing the contradictory meanings of Takarazuka productions over time, with special attention to the World War II period, Robertson illuminates the intricate web of relationships among managers, directors, actors, fans, and social critics, whose clashes and compromises textured the theater and the wider society in colorful and complex ways.<br>
 Using Takarazuka as a key to understanding the ""logic"" of everyday life in Japan and placing the Revue squarely in its own social, historical, and cultural context, she challenges both the stereotypes of ""the Japanese"" and the Eurocentric notions of gender performance and sexuality.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/13/9780520211513.jpg,Success,115,21.3

<br>
Every woman remembers the sting of betrayal of a girlfriend, and every parent of a daughter has seen her come home from school in tears because a girl she thought was her best friend suddenly and inexplicably became her enemy. While boys hash out differences with fists and kicks, girls' societies are marked by secrets and whispers and shifting affection. The lessons learned as an adolescent girl are often carried into adulthood, making women fear confrontation—especially with other women. But the intensity of the struggles reflects the support and healing to be found within these friendships. Girls find themselves in the mirror of other girls, hence the power each has to influence the other. <br>
<br>
Ruthellen Josselson and Terri Apter's many years of working with hundreds of girls and women have given them insight into the emotionally important relationships that are integral to a girl's self-image. <b>Best Friends</b> explores the bonds of friendship between girls and between women and the sorrows and joys they experience together, from early adolescence and throughout their lives.",en,1,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/67/9780609601167.jpg,Success,131,21.3

0-679-75476-8,The Farewell Symphony,"White, Edmund",Vintage,432,9/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p><P>Following <i>A Boy's Own Story</i> (now a classic of American fiction) and his richly acclaimed <i>The Beautiful Room Is Empty,</i> here is the eagerly awaited final volume of Edmund White's groundbreaking autobiographical trilogy. <P>Named for the work by Haydn in which the instrumentalists leave the stage one after another until only a single violin remains playing, this is the story of a man who has outlived most of his friends. Having reached the six-month anniversary of his lover's death, he embarks on a journey of remembrance that will recount his struggle to become a writer and his discovery of what it means to be a gay man. His witty, conversational narrative transports us from the 1960s to the near present, from starkly erotic scenes in the back rooms of New York clubs to episodes of rarefied hilarity in the salons of Paris to moments of family truth in the American Midwest. Along the way, a breathtaking variety of personal connections&#151;and near misses&#151;slowly builds an awareness of the transformative power of genuine friendship, of love and loss, culminating in an indelible experience with a dying man. And as the flow of memory carries us across time, space and society, one man's magnificently realized story grows to encompass an entire generation.<P>Sublimely funny yet elegiac, full of unsparingly trenchant social observation yet infused with wisdom and a deeply felt compassion, <b>The Farewell Symphony</b> is a triumph of reflection and expressive elegance. It is also a stunning and wholly original panorama of gay life over the past thirty years&#151;the crowning achievement of one of our finest writers.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Marked equally by erotic fervor and lyrical intensity, the final installment in White's autobiographical trilogy (following <i>A Boy's Own Story</i> and <i>The Beautiful Room Is Empty</i>) is also the longest, the most baroque and the most elegiac. It carries us from the heady days of the Stonewall Riots through the ravages of AIDS. As usual, White subordinates his interest in the larger matters of recent gay history to the task of vividly evoking the men in the narrator's life through whom those events are understoodusually in a sympathetic, Proustian effort at social taxonomy. The giggling, snobbish, closeted 'White Russians' slumming at the Stonewall typify one kind of gay man, just as Brandy, a sequined and exquisitely theatrical drag queen, represents another. The narrator literally embraces many of them, he seems perpetually as surprised by his catholic tastes in men as he is by the fetishes of others. The novel is invigoratingly, rigorously artificial, flirting with mannerism even as it celebrates sprit and erudition in others (one James Merrill-esque poet dismisses some Japanese scrolls as 'the usual swirls before pine'). Expatriate life, first in Rome and then (for a more extensive period) in an initially inhospitable Paris sharpens the narrator's sense of isolation; a rejection slip for his novel sends him into suicidal despair, from which salvation lies (typically) in a liaison with a Danish tourist. As the narrator's writing career flourishes, he finds himself in the rarefied company of powerful, learned editors, poets and novelists -- company that intersects rather than stands distinct from the priapic habitus of Greenwich Village. Extended episodes involving his mother's decline into illness and dementia, his father's death and his sister's coming to terms with her lesbianism highlight the insularity of the narrator's world. The book is best enjoyed not for a strong story, indeed, the Brice for whom the narrator mourns at the beginning and close is rather peripheral, but for its luminous snapshots of New York, Paris and Rome and of the vital parade of mendowdy, forbiddingly gorgeous, sylph-like, ephebic, closeted, defiantly and militantly outthat crowd its pages.</p>",en,1st Vintage international ed,"Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches",17,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/63/9780679754763.jpg,Success,66,21.3

Troubled by the elusiveness of men, yet convinced that they run the world, she can barely conceal her desperation to entice. Struggling with motherhood and the failure of marriage, she takes jobs to bridge intervals between lovers. She sings in a hotel bar, sells dresses, and nurses her father's friend through his last illness, hoping to atone for a self-centered life. The constant in Vivian's life is her son, David. Having seen her worst and best moments, he provides her with consolation and a reason for living, ""In those days of her lover's absence, she grew fascinated with her son's beauty .... with the hard blue of his eyes, with all the particulars of his face, the pliability of his lips."" The Son is the haunting story of a woman who desires ""something more, as if something more had been promised her that was not yet given.""

Yet on the outskirts of town an overturned carriage forces the shaken travelers to take refuge at a nearby manor house. And it is there that Jane meets the darkly forbidding yet strangely attractive Mr. Geoffrey Sidmouth. What murky secrets does the brooding Mr. Sidmouth seek to hide? Jane suspects the worst&#8212;but her attention is swiftly diverted when a man is discovered hanged from a makeshift gibbet by the sea. The worthies of Lyme are certain his death is the work of &quot;the Reverend,&quot; the ringleader of the midnight smuggling trade whose identity is the town's paramount mystery. Now, it falls to Jane to entrap and expose the notorious Reverend...even if the evidence points to the last person on earth she wants to suspect...a man who already may have won her heart.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Nearly as wry as Jane Austen herself, Barron delivers pleasure and amusement in her second delicious Jane Austen mystery (Jane and the Unpleasantness of Scargave Manor, 1996). While headed to Lyme Regis for a seaside holiday in 1804, the Austen carriage overturns and Jane's sister Cassandra is injured. The family finds shelter at High Down Grange, home of sardonic Geoffrey Sidmouth and his beautiful cousin Seraphine LeFevre. The narrative is structured as a journal in which Barron's Jane notes her distress at finding herself attracted to the sensuous Sidmouth. The Austens' trip is historically accurate but sparsely enough documented to allow Barron great latitude in creating a tale that makes the most of the period when the Napoleonic Wars raged and the coast was rife with smugglers. At the local Assembly dance, Jane gathers gossip from the Crawfords, Barnewalls, Lucy Armstrong and Captain Percival Fielding, an injured naval officer, who hints that Sidmouth is the Reverend, a notorious smuggler. When Fielding is murdered and Sidmouth arrested, a customs agent asks Jane to conduct an undercover investigation. She eagerly agrees. With indefatigable daring and intelligence, Jane discovers the true natures of her new acquaintances and the meaning of heroism. While Austen denied that her characters were based on real people, Barron cleverly turns to characters from Austen novels as models for her own: Mrs. Bennet for Mrs. Austen, Willoughby for Sidmouth, Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy for Jane's with Sidmouth. Worthy of its origins, this book is a delight.

In <i>Walking the Maze</i> she explores Celtic culture both in comparison to Native American ways of life and in its own light and strength, examining the attributes that define and sustain the vitality of the Celtic spirit. Four aspects of traditional Celtic life common to both Celtic and Native American cultures are kinship consciousness, a high regard for women as part of a general commitment to freedom, a fluid perspective of reality, and a primal spiritual engagement with the land. For the Celts this crafted rugged, land-loving individualists, fierce and free in their expression, gracious to all, answerable directly to Spirit but responsible for the entire community. This vision of Celtic spirit informs the vision of how we may live in the present, renewing a cultural integrity that is inseparable from personal wholeness and ecological consciousness. <p>Loren Cruden, a midwife and herbal healer of Scottish descent, worked for many years with a Potawatomie medicine man to develop her personal spiritual practice.

Award-winning author Alicia Steimberg captures the quirky insights of a teenager in a flawlessly rendered colloquial style.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A pungent, semi-autobiographical account of growing up Jewish in Argentina in the 1940s, this small gem of a novel (originally published in Spanish in 1971) is marked by Steimberg's distinctive voice--wittily irreverent, ironic yet warm, at once precocious and worldly-wise. The young narrator (also named Alicia Steimberg) conjures up an offbeat family portrait gallery, including Alicia's controlling, widowed mother, hypochondriac maternal Kiev-born grandmother, atheist vegetarian grandfather and endlessly feuding aunts. Alicia, stigmatized by her anti-Semitic fifth-grade teacher, undergoes a pseudo-conversion to Catholicism with a Catholic playmate 10 years her senior. The narrator's blossoming sexuality (and her mother's dire reprimands against autoeroticism), the trauma of an uncle pawing her sexually, her budding political sensibility in regimented Peronist Argentina are recorded with great humor and the perceptiveness of a sensitive, insecure girl in an eccentric, overbearing family. Labinger's translation is a delight, conveying the sights, sounds, misconceptions and dreams of an intensely experienced youth.

Now Stephanie Bender, an expert in women's hormonal health, sounds a wake-up call for the confusing years before menopause, which require special emotional, dietary, and health guidance.
<p><b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explains how symptoms such as irregular cycles, night sweats and insomnia, decreased libido, memory lapses, and mood swings can be traced to fluctuating hormones. It gives detailed recommendations on how to use both conventional and alternative approaches to lessen symptoms, including the most up-to-date research and new treatments. Bender also goes beyond medical advice to show women how all facets of their lives, from diet to attitude to lifestyle, can be transformed to make this an exciting and productive phase. Perimenopause is a time when women can reconsider their beliefs and priorities with newfound wisdom--perhaps discarding outmoded images of female beauty and examining their relationships with lovers and family on a deeper level. <b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explores this neglected age with practical ways to enhance the quality of all areas of women's lives.</p>

The Nearsighted Naturalist brings together work from more than two decades in her career as one of our most distinguished natural history writers. From the Indiana landscape of her youth to her Colorado mountain retreat, from Arizona's Aravaipa Canyon to New Zealand's Kapiti Island, Zwinger leads an ever-widening armchair tour of natural places both ordinary and astonishing. Whether anticipating the first day of spring or seeing the elegance of the subtle hues of a moth's papery wings, Zwinger's trademark eye for detail brings the landscape alive. Her travels trace her evolution from a home-centered wife and mother to a wandering adventurer, an evolution that has taught her to be at home in nature no matter where she is. Sprinkled with Zwinger's own charming pen-and-ink drawings, The Nearsighted Naturalist reminds us of the power of the very best nature writing. It is an invitation to wander, to travel to faraway places, to revisit your own backyard, to chase dragonflies, and to experience the healing power of a sea-smoothed pebble. With the author, readers will embark on a fascinating exploration into distant deserts of the mind and hillsides of the heart.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In a collection of essays that includes works from over two decades, Zwinger explores the abundant life in Rocky Mountain rivers, streams and ponds as well as the experience of whitewater rafting and exploring the world from Colorado to China. Whether she's crouching by the side of a stream observing stonefly nymphs, or doggedly seeking signs of a short-lived spring in Colorado, Zwinger combines eloquent writing with a devotion to nature. She describes and catalogues every creature, including those seemingly insignificant, tiny animals invisible to all eyes but those trained to look. As one might guess from the title, Zwinger's vision isn't perfect, but her myopia forces her, she says, to get even closer to her subjects. Having been raised in Indiana, she also comes to her new home in the Rocky Mountains with the unjaundiced eye of an outsider. But it was in Indiana that she first learned to love observing and writing about nature. Nature writing, she explains, was part of my upbringing. Quite early my mother gave me Gene Stratton Porter's A Girl of the Limberlost to read. Since then she has expanded her list of literary models to include Annie Dillard and Edwin Way Teale, among many others, and here Zwinger once again displays the eloquence, beauty and acuity that put her in that great tradition. Includes pen- and-ink drawings. (Sept.) FYI: Zwinger's last book, Downcanyon, won the Western States Book Award for Creative Nonfiction.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",15.88,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/14/9780816518814.jpg,Success,115,21.3

0-8147-7477-6,"Opposite Sex: Gay Men on Lesbians, Lesbians on Gay Men",,NYU Press,276,4/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p>The past decade has seen an extraordinary outpouring of research, writing, and talk about lesbian and gay sexuality, triggered in part by the confluence of the AIDS epidemic, the feminist sex wars, and the development of queer studies. Yet many lesbian and gay writers and readers have been frustrated by recurring gaps and absences in the queer studies approach to sexuality, as well as by the limitations of explicit queer community discourse around sex.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Sex</b> brings the sex back into queer studies, making real bodies, acts, and desires central to analysis of the complex relationships between male and female homosexualities, and their impact on lesbian and gay culture. The contributors to this volume--scholars, artists, activists, and journalists--redress the remarkable dearth of thoughtful discourse about the many ways in which lesbian and gay men are implicated--and viewed within--in each other's sexual realities.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Sex</b> includes writing by lesbians and gay men about each other's bodies, interpretations of different male and female homosexual sex cultures, and reflections on the history, sociology, and politics of changing discourses around queer sexuality. Passionate and challenging, this anthology shows the rich and complex forms through which individuals and communities make meaning from their quotidian sexual impulses, their utopian sexual mores, and their idiosyncratic sexual acts.</p>

That craving -- an unnatural longing -- can be as innocuous as a strong desire for chocolate or a cigarette. Chinese food. Crocodile leather heels. An angora sweater. But at the heart of all intense desires lie impulses heavy with psychosexual implications. This anthology, put together by New York cultural hipster John Yau, explores some of the more extreme variations on this theme. Many of the stories in <i>Fetish</i> are wildly funny -- absurd to those of us with a 'normal' mindset -- and others expose readers to a psychic underbelly, at once menacing and intriguing. Many appear here in print for the first time.
<p>Sex with corpses, John Yau's feet, S&amp;M bars, and magical aerosol sprays are discussed -- in depth -- algongside pederasty, unfulfilled and unfulfillable longings, aching for lost love, and dreaming of a body not one's own.</p>
<p>But the stories in <i>Fetish</i> are not just about sex: you don't have to be a pervert to be a fetishist. A fetish is something we worship, a magical totem. Recent films such as <i>Fetishes</i>, <i>Female Perversions</i>, <i>Kissed</i>, and <i>Crash</i> suggest the wider public's growing interest in fetishism. Eric Kroll's best-selling photography book <i>Fetish</i> is a further example, as is the media's fascination with fetishists from Susie Bright and Robert Mapplethorpe to Imelda Marcos and Howard Hughes.</p>
<p><i>Fetish</i> is outrageous, at turns funny, sad, and provocative. It is a sparkling collection of unfettered work by some of today's most interesting writers.</p>",en,,5.30 (w) x 8.28 (h) x 0.78 (d),15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/70/9781568581170.jpg,Success,67,21.3

Then Ava's future crumbled -- she tested positive for HIV. Believing her life to be over, she returns to Idlewild, Michigan, the small town of her childhood. But home is not what it used to be, and Ava's homecoming is anything but the sorrowful end she expected. Big-city problems have made their way to Idlewild, and Ava finds a new beginning in working with the town's troubled black youths. Oh, and then there's Wild Eddie -- nothing gives a gal a new lease on life like falling in love!</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>It takes talent to make a love story between an AIDS victim and a convicted murderer work, but playwright/essayist Cleage (<i>Deals with the Devil</i>) more than meets the challenge in this gutsy, very likable fiction debut.<P>As a teenager, Ava Johnson couldn't wait to move away from tiny Idlewild, Michigan, a lakefront village originally conceived&#151;and enjoyed for decades&#151;as a resort town for people of color. Now just a half-abandoned dot on the map like any other (except that still, most of its residents are black), Idlewild offers the only safe haven when Ava, now nearly 30, learns she's contracted the HIV virus and is forced to close down her hair salon in Atlanta. Telling herself she's just visiting her older sister, Joyce, for a few weeks before she moves on to San Francisco, sophisticated Ava (whose voice is always feisty and humorous, even when the subject is death) is nevertheless impressed by bighearted Joyce's efforts to help the teenaged girls in her small community. She's also intrigued by handsome, sexily 'together' Eddie Jefferson, a once-wild childhood acquaintance who's returned to Idlewild to raise vegetables, grow dreadlocks, and practice t'ai chi. While giving support to Joyce as she fights her conservative church for the right to teach parenting to adolescents, and assisting (a bit skeptically) when Joyce takes in an addict's abandoned baby, Ava finds herself falling hard for sensitive, nurturing Eddie. Obviously, he's interested, too&#151;but won't he run once he learns she's carrying the virus? Ava hardly dares hope for a final chance at love, even when Eddie reveals his own terrible&#151;and, finally, forgivable&#151;past. Lively, topical, and fantasy-filled. Watch out, Terry McMillan.

Are there unique health issues for lesbians? Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance abuse? How does homophobia affect lesbian health and the funding of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian health needs fit into the health care system and the larger society? What risk and protective factors shape the physical and mental health of lesbians?</p> <h3>Marilyn R. Gugliucci</h3> <p>This book is a compilation of the research conducted on lesbian health. The editor outlines the challenges of such research for lesbians, researchers, and society. After a presentation of a comprehensive review of the issues, a list of recommendations and interpretations are suggested for mapping out future directions for lesbian health research. The stated purpose is to assess the science base strengths of lesbian health research, review the methodological challenges involved in conducting said research, and to suggest areas for future attention and research. Although women's health is gaining momentum as an area worthy of research, the lesbian subgroup continues to receive minimal attention. Raising the issues pertaining to lesbian health and research in this field is long overdue. The editor's objectives are clearly outlined and achieved. In addition, the contributors demonstrate recognition and knowledge of the psycho-social and societal issues inherent in lesbian cultures which add to the challenges of conducting lesbian health research. The purpose is to help ""...health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and others interested in lesbian health, to face the challenges and opportunities of the new millennium."" A much stronger appeal needs to be made to lesbians. The text is clear, well organized, and accessible. I view it as empowering to lesbians, in that lesbians can assist in moving the health agenda forward through their participation in research and by supporting policy in this area. The contributors appear to be credible. Credentials are listed in their respective fields, however, there is no statement of philosophy regarding their attitudes of lesbianism.Contributors begin with an executive summary of lesbian health research reviews completed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities. The summary is comprehensive and lays the foundation for the in-depth information found in the body of the text that includes the health status of and risks for lesbians. Included is a holistic definition of health which makes it clear that health is more than the absence of disease or infirmity. Lesbian health is viewed in the larger context of society and the healthcare system. Contributors include the societal challenges for lesbians and the effect these may have on their health. The strengths of this book are: the combination of education and sensitivity with which lesbian health issues are discussed; the consistency of the contributors' appeal to the reader to realize the impact these issues have on the research; the inclusion of cultural, racial, ethnic, and societal factors on this research; and the complexities of lesbian health at the personal, professional, and societal levels. Features worth noting are the use of tables, figures, and boxes that enhance the content, and an extensive and current bibliography that is organized by topics. A shortcoming is the repetitive information found in the executive summary that is restated in the body of the text. Lesbianism and its health issues will remain a part of all cultures and populations throughout the world. The proactive stance of this research review and the contributors' recommendations are critical to educating people about lesbians' health issues and relevant policies. It is about time that awareness is raised in this under-funded, under-researched, and largely closeted area of women's health. I commend the editor and contributors for their academic as well as humanistic exposition of this review.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.28 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/36/9780309060936.jpg,Success,6,21.3

Over half of the works included here have not been published or are only available in the Library of America edition of Hurston's works. As Hurston's fans know, all of her novels draw upon her deep interest in folklore, particularly from her home state of Florida. Here we see the roots of that work, from the wonderful folktale of the monstrous alligator living in a local lake to her recording of folk songs to her work on children's games and the black church. There are also fiery and controversial essays on race and the work of black artists. In a biographical essay, Pamala Bordelon, with the help of Hurston's niece, has re-created the years during which Hurston was working for the FWP and living in Eatonville. She has put together the portrait of a serious writer and folklorist who was running tight on money, but big on spirit.

What you're in for is gossip of the most salacious and informed variety, with Plimpton acting as genial segue artist: ""As soon as he landed in a town -- Paris, say -- it didn't seem to take him more than a minute to be at the center of things."" <P>And that is the initial thrill of this book, the center stage vantage it offers on the determined self-formation of an artist. It charts Capote's early childhood in Monroeville, Ala. -- then, in New York, his brief moments as an office boy at the <i>New Yorker</i> (he was fired) and his acceptance at the Yaddo Writers Colony. Then comes the glitter -- <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i>, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> and <i>In Cold Blood</i> -- followed by the climax, Capote's rather over-pondered Black and White Ball, which receives more space here than any one of his books. This is quickly followed by ruin in the guise of alcoholism and his roman &#224; clef <i>Answered Prayers</i>. People are, of course, unkind about him. Norman Mailer weighs in on the ball, saying, ""It certainly was his greatest coup. For some, and I might be one of them, that party was even greater than any particular one of his books."" (Contextually, the statement doesn't seem particularly nasty, especially with the likes of Gore Vidal attempting to be both withering and nonchalant.) <P>The portrait that emerges is of an increasingly vicious, jealous, competitive, deceptive little bastard, the nasty little girl of American letters -- a version of Dorothy Parker. One hundred seventy-four impressive names (a number of them now dead) have been diligently interviewed here, and one can be forgiven for wondering whether anyone with a brain has a kind word for the man. The omissions too are curious -- neither Harper Lee nor C.Z. Guest are included, perhaps explaining the unfortunate inclusion of a 12-page remembrance by one of Capote's boyfriends' daughters. <P>But by the end of this oral biography, there's a more autumnal feeling in the air. Dominick Dunne recalls his own period of drying out, during which he received a letter of admiration, out of the blue, from Capote. ""We were not that good friends that I deserved that kind of letter. So what I had done is obviously what he knew that he should have done. After he died it became very fashionable to kick him. Not me. I've never forgotten that letter he wrote me."" Later comes the charming revelation that Capote made a series of decorative boxes, and <i>Truman Capote</i> ends on a disarmingly gentle note with poet James Dickey's eulogy. Somehow, in the midst of the cacophonous din of this cocktail party, Plimpton has ferreted out the sweetness of the man, using the same method that Dickey described as Capote's: ""the craft of the artist by means of which the intently human thing is caught."" -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.2 Inches, Weight: 1.33 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",18,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/30/9780385491730.jpg,Success,65,21.3

<p>A hundred years ago, women were lacing themselves into corsets and teaching their daughters to do the same. The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?</p>
<p>In <b>The Body Project</b>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance—in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <b>The Body Project</b> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism—a world in which the body is their primary project.</p>

<p>From the world-famous Swiss psychologist whose book <b>The Drama of the Gifted Child</b> has become a classic, here are seven ""life stories"" exploring the countless ways in which our families and our childhood experiences form us and turn us into the people we are today.</p>
<p>How do early experiences of love or suffering affect our adult relationships? What effect is child abuse likely to have on the victim's later life? How does hatred evolve and take root? How do people develop into cult leaders or political tyrants? Through the seven hypothetical scenarios and two essays that make up Paths of Life, Miller examines these questions and many others. Her narratives demonstrate that with knowledge and understanding of our past we have the power to change our future, freeing ourselves from the curse of repeating our parents' mistakes. In this, her eighth book, Alice Miller has given us yet another wise and profound study of the inestimable importance of childhood.</p>

Now, her mother was a prim, unsmiling woman who died when she was three, but this is something - someone - else, a laughing, beautiful, sexy girl, who inscribed the picture to - someone Allegra's never heard of. Astonished and intrigued, she returns to her hometown of Los Angeles to find out more about this mother of hers, only to be met with smiles and evasions and a definite sense that people are keeping something from her - which, of course, only makes her more determined to find out what it is, even though she's beginning to suspect she's not going to like it one little bit.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.44 Inches, Length: 5.7 Inches, Weight: 0.82 Pounds, Width: 0.99 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/72/9780399144172.jpg,Success,130,21.3

The contributors were chosen not only for the distinguished quality of their work, but also for the range of architectural practices they collectively encompass—from the intersection of theory and philosophy to the intersection of building process and industry. Together, they present a compelling and provocative critique of architectural culture. All show a willingness to transgress the various mediums and territories of architecture, to recover and reopen certain discussions lost in the architectural discourse they have inherited.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.9 Inches, Length: 7.7 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",5.75,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/53/9780262581653.jpg,Success,59,21.3

Opening with the extended family’s awkward attendance at the funeral of Serena, aging flower child of the sixties, the symbolic conflicts build quickly. Serena’s sister Merit, the hard-driving, social-program-budget-slashing female political aparatchik and her husband Leonard, a lion of free enterprise, are hell bent on dismantling their government’s social services by replacing them with a privatized human warehousing system whose track record to date has been the streamlining of the American prison system. But there’s a problem: Serena’s developmentally challenged friend Corker, the family’s faded and failed country gentleman brother Galahad, and their octogenarian mother Florence, all become victims of Merit and Leonard’s “success.”</p>
<p>It is Wendy Lill’s great skill as a playwright that actually makes this symbolism work by unravelling it into a devastating conclusion that is seen in two completely different ways by the characters and the audience. While everyone in the play is celebrating their “one big happy family” reunion (brought about by Merit and Leonard having seen the “error of their ways”), the audience, having realized the characters are all about to lose their comfortable designer house and are headed for the unheated trailer park, watches in horror as the social worker brings in huge green garbage bags of junk. This play is not what it seems at all. This is not agitprop. This is killer theatre.</p>

With This Book, Elizabeth Varon Effectively Challenges Such Historical Assumptions. Using A Wide Array Of Sources, She Demonstrates That Throughout The Antebellum Period, White Southern Women Of The Slaveholding Class Were Important Actors In The Public Drama Of Politics. Through Their Voluntary Associations, Legislative Petitions, Presence At Political Meetings And Rallies, And Published Appeals, Virginia's Elite White Women Lent Their Support To Such Controversial Reform Enterprises As The Temperance Movement And The American Colonization Society, To The Electoral Campaigns Of The Whig And Democratic Parties, To The Literary Defense Of Slavery, And To The Causes Of Unionism And Secession.

Sweeping, dramatic, rich with humanity, and rigorous in its science,<i> Where Later the Sweet Birds Sang</i> is widely regarded as a high point of both humanistic and ""hard"" SF, and won SF's Hugo Award and Locus Award on its first publication. It is as compelling today as it was then.</p><h3>NY Times Book Review</h3><p>In this science fiction tale, the sterile survivors of a global environmental catastrophe turn to mass cloning, but the clones' communal upbringing deprives them of imagination and creativity.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",18.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/50/9780312866150.jpg,Success,76,21.3
