Book Weekend during the festival's off years. Created
to gather the words and ideas of New Zealand's fine 3 =
women writers and thinkers, this year’s roster was
packed: over 40 women authors were on the program.
All the writers’ books were released in 1998, on
subjects from politics to cooking to travel to fiction
and poetry.
Among the highlights was the opening event of
the weekend, a speech by New Zealand Labour
Party leader Helen Clark (who will be running for
Prime Minister this fall). Irish poet Sinead Morrissey
read her work, and Beu said that she “stole the
show.... Her lilting Irish voice held the audience in
attentive rapture; a collective sigh broke the silence
at the end of every poem.” Union Made, a women’s

political songs on Friday night. Sandra Coney,

149,"Women Writing a Feminist Future!
Sugar Land Spinsters
by Joni Rodgers
ISBN 1-883523-32-X $12.00 (Pub. date: May 1999) Ink
As children, Kit and Kiki Smithers performed throughout Texas as “The Sugar
Babes.” Now Kit and Kiki are all grown up. All that remains are the blues the
sisters sing as they come to terms with life and death and everything in between.
Simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious, Sugar Land is about the healing
power of forgiveness, the seemingly impossible task of loving, the resilience of
family ties, and what happens when a tornado hits a double-wide trailer.
Conferences are Murder
by Val McDermid
ISBN 1-883523-30-3 $12.00 (Pub. date: April 1999)
From the critically-acclaimed author of the popular Kate Brannigan series. In
this latest Lindsay Gordon feminist mystery, Lindsay and her new love, Sophie,
search among hundreds of unruly convention delegates for a murderer who may
have struck once before.
“Neatly constructed and spendidly sarcastic about the circus of union politics.”
—London Daily Telegraph
Originally published in England as Union Jack by The Women's Press, Ltd.
Ordinary Justice
by Trudy Labovitz
ISBN 1-883523-31-1 $12.00 (Pub. date: May 1999)
In her debut novel, Trudy Labovitz introduces us to ex-P.I. Zoe Kergulin, who,
while investigating a stormy relationship that has ended in the brutal murder of
one spouse and the mysterious disappearance of the other, encounters a com-
munity of mountain folk hiding secrets, ranging from hunting out of season, to
the production of moonshine, to domestic violence.
