Other films considered here are Blue Gardenia, Gilda, Double Indemnity, modern noir films like Klute, and the horror classic The Haunting, which one critic sees as a representation of the ""disruptive force of lesbian desire.""

0-226-72180-9,Gay Lives: Homosexual Autobiography from John Addington Symonds to Paul Monette,"Robinson, Paul",University of Chicago Press,456,3/1/1999,,Hardcover,"<p>In his autobiography, John Addington Symonds relates a glorious night of passion, in which he and his lover ""lay covered from the cold in bed, tasting the honey of softly spoken words and the blossoms of lips pressed on lips."" Christopher Isherwood's first autobiography, on the other hand, was far less direct; he wrote a second autobiography in part because the first was ""not truly autobiographical"" in that ""the author conceals important facts about himself."" These contradictions, evasions, and explicit sexual details of the life stories of fourteen men form <i>Gay Lives</i>, a revealing account of homosexual autobiography.</p>
<p>Paul Robinson reads the memoirs of French, British, and American gay authors—André Gide, Quentin Crisp, and Martin Duberman, among others—through the prism of sexual identity, asking fascinating questions about homosexuality and its relation to literary form. How did these authors discover their sexual identity? Did they embrace it or reject it? How did they express often conflicted desires in their words, which ranged from defiant and brutally frank to ambiguous and abstract? Robinson considers the choices each made—as a man and an author—to accommodate himself to society's homophobia or live in protest against his oppression.</p>
<p>Despite the threads that connect these stories, <i>Gay Lives</i> refutes the notion that there is a typical homosexual ""career"" by showing that gay men have led wildly dissimilar lives—from the exuberant to the miserable—and that they have found no less dissimilar meanings in those lives.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.375 Inches, Weight: 2.12525620568 Pounds, Width: 1.6 Inches",41,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/04/9780226721804.jpg,Success,82,22.1

Thus A Mother Who Abuses Her Daughter Physically Or Verbally Leaves Unhealed Wounds.

0-8223-2343-5,Bound and Gagged: Pornography and the Politics of Fantasy in America,"Kipnis, Laura",Duke University Press Books,240,12/23/1998,,Paperback,"<p>In a book that completely changes the terms of the pornography debate, Laura Kipnis challenges the position that porn perpetuates misogyny and sex crimes. First published in 1996, <i>Bound and Gagged</i> opens with the chilling case of Daniel DePew, a man convicted—in the first computer bulletin board entrapment case—of conspiring to make a snuff film and sentenced to thirty-three years in prison for merely trading kinky fantasies with two undercover cops.<br>
Using this textbook example of social hysteria as a springboard, Kipnis argues that criminalizing fantasy—even perverse and unacceptable fantasy—has dire social consequences. Exploring the entire spectrum of pornography, she declares that porn isn’t just about gender and that fantasy doesn’t necessarily constitute intent. She reveals Larry Flynt’s <i>Hustler</i> to be one of the most politically outspoken and class-antagonistic magazine in the country and shows how fetishes such as fat admiration challenge our aesthetic prejudices and socially sanctioned disgust. Kipnis demonstrates that the porn industry—whose multibillion-dollar annual revenues rival those of the three major television networks combined—know precisely how to tap into our culture’s deepest anxieties and desires, and that this knowledge, more than all the naked bodies, is what guarantees its vast popularity.<br>
<i>Bound and Gagged</i> challenges our most basic assumptions about America’s relationship with pornography and questions what the calls to eliminate it are really attempting to protect.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.70106999316 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/33/9780822323433.jpg,Success,83,22.1

The griot kept the oral history of the tribe.... He was in charge of remembering everything. He was a storyteller."" So writes Cornelia Walker Bailey, a storyteller indeed, in this rich account of the Geechee people of her native Sapelo Island, a barrier island off the coast of Georgia. The Saltwater Geechee are a group of African Americans directly descended from enslaved West Africans, whose cultural identity has been largely preserved due to the relative isolation of Sapelo.
<p>In rhythmic, conversational prose, Bailey captures the experience of growing up in an island community that counted the spirits of its departed among its members, relied on pride and ingenuity in the face of hardship, and taught her firsthand how best to reap the bounty of the marshes, woods, and ocean that surrounded her. We learn of Miss Katie Underwood, the island midwife who relies on ancient custom when birthing babies, of Grandma Winnie, whose taste for moonshine and men doesn't get in the way of her earning the love of her steadfast husband, of dream-signs, natural portents, and the ""root"" magic that certain elders have the power to perform.</p>

As a sociological fieldworker, she began her research during the late 1980s, before any kind of a public queer identity existed in that country. After a decade of conducting interviews, as well as observing and analyzing plays, books, pop music, and graffiti, Essig presents the first sustained study of how and why there was no Soviet gay community or even gay identity before <i>perestroika</i> and the degree to which this situation has-or has not-changed.<br>While male homosexual acts were criminalized in Russia before 1993, women attracted to women were policed by the medical community, who saw them less as criminals than as diseased persons potentially cured by drug therapy or transsexual surgery. After describing accounts of pre-<i>perestroika</i> persecution, Essig examines the more recent state of sexual identities in Russia. Although the fall of communism brought new freedom to Russian queers, there are still no signs of a mass movement forming around the issue, and few identify themselves as lesbians or gay men, even when they are involved in same-sex relations. Essig does reveal, however, vibrant manifestations of gay life found at the local level-in restaurants, discos, clubs, and cruising strips, in newspapers, journals, literature, and the theater. Concluding with a powerful exploration of the surprising affinities between some of Russiaâs most prominent nationalists and its queers, <i>Queer in Russia</i> fills a gap in both Russian and cultural studies.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.23899791244 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/64/9780822323464.jpg,Success,81,22.1

One treats drug users as patients, the other as criminals. However, beginning in the late 1980s, the ""crack mother"" scare led to an unprecedented alliance between doctors and prosecutors in same states, where doctors turned addicted pregnant women over to the police for arrest, trial, and incarceration. Humphries analyzes the public reaction to crack cocaine and the policies instituted to combat it. She shows us that more often than not, policies were generated by the fears that crack mothers were harbingers of even more serious social problems. The media's construction of the crack mother as a model of depravity is, she argues, a reflection of mainstream desires and fears, not a reflection of the truth.

0-449-22361-2,N Is for Noose,"Grafton, Sue",Fawcett,336,3/29/1999,,Paperback,"<p>""When I first wrote <i>Alibi</i>, Grafton is quoted as saying, ""I was just trying to get it done. I certainly wasn't thinking about a series."" With that profound statement hovering somewhere in her past, Sue Grafton now offers her fourteenth novel in the popular Alphabet Mystery series. <i>""N"" Is for Noose</i> finds Kinsey investigating the mysterious death of Nota Lake sheriff Tom Newquist. But when it becomes clear that the strange town has some very dark secrets, Kinsey realizes that if she's not careful, she could be the victim of the town's next crime.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The noose of the title implies a tight knot, but the twists and turns of Grafton's latest plot are pretty loose. Not that the fans of self-reliant PI Kinsey Millhone's 13 previous alphabet appearances (from 1982's <i>A Is for Alibi</i> through 1996's <i>M Is for Malice</i>) are likely to object. This story takes Kinsey away from her Southern California coastal town of Santa Teresa to the small mountain community of Nota Lake in the Sierras. There, Selma Newquist hires Kinsey to ferret out the problem that had been seriously bothering her cop husband, Tom, before his recent death from a heart attack. Kinsey's efforts are soon stonewalled as the residents of Nota Lake unite, suggesting that the widow is being troublesome while the good-guy cop should be left to rest in peace. Kinsey wonders whether the townspeople might be right until she is seriously beaten up in her Nota Lake motel room. Focusing on finding the dead man's missing notebook, she follows his trail to a seedy hotel not far from Santa Teresa that he visited a few weeks before his death. While keeping a suspicious eye on the dead man's police partner and a few other local figures, Kinsey determines that Tom Newquist had been investigating an old murder near Nota Lake, which may have had ties to a similar, recent murder. Lots of coincidences, some over-the top characters, including a hyper-raunchy older woman, and some unprepared-for elements contribute to the rather chaotic climax. But Grafton's easy-reading, intelligent prose and her heroine's sharp humor, served up dark and wry, make up for a slew of plot weaknesses. Mystery Guild main selection; Literary Guild selection.

A self-taught artist from rural Georgia, she began creating when she was alone after the death of her second husband in 1948. From then until her death, her dreams and memories salved her loneliness with images of a bygone day, and these she made into art.</p>
<p><i>The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe</i> is the most substantial gathering of her work to date. Here eighty full color and ten black and white images display the artist's extraordinary intuitive color sense and the vibrancy and variety of her work.</p>
<p>She used whatever materials were at hand. When painting and drawing on paper, Styrofoam, cardboard, and wood, she favored plain and colored pencils, ink and felt tip pens, and gouache. Jewelry, lace, wigs, felt hats, and eye-glasses enhanced her cloth dolls. Sculpting, she gathered found objects, marbles, and glitter and fastened them with chewing gum. In these color-saturated works, there is an exuberant and idiosyncratic self-expression.</p>
<p>Lee Kogan, director of the Folk Art Institute of the Museum of American Folk Art, unites the paintings and sculptures with a look at the artist's surroundings, practices, and culture. This collection of her work also includes a preface by Gerard C. Wertkin, Director of the Museum of American Folk Art, and a contextual essay by Atlanta-born Kinshasa Holman Conwill, director of the Studio Museum of Harlem.</p>
<p>Nellie Mae Rowe lived her entire life on the rural fringes of Atlanta in Fayetteville and Vinings, Georgia. She was one of nine daughters of a former slave who worked as a farmer, a blacksmith, and basket weaver.</p>",en,F First Printing,"Height: 12.31 inches, Length: 9.35 inches, Weight: 2.04 Pounds, Width: 0.68 inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/27/9781578061327.jpg,Success,51,22.1

1-57392-264-1,The Wandering Womb : A Cultural History of Outrageous Beliefs About Woman,"Thompson, Lana",Prometheus,208,2/1/1999,,Hardcover,"<p>Female anatomy, especially the womb, has for centuries been shrouded in mystery and misunderstanding, defining the social place of women in male dominated cultures. Even with advances in medicine, some in today's society believe they can control women's sexual identity.</p>
<p>The Wandering Womb is a provocative tour through religious, medical, and social histories, pinpointing humorous, outrageous, and hair-raising beliefs, practices, and longstanding falsehoods that permeate human cultures. In Egyptian times, it was believed that the womb was an entity unto itself capable of ""wandering"" in the body, and also into the world beyond in search of nourishment! This idea, and many others were entwined in medical ignorance and religious superstition, which have often labeled women as incomplete, inferior, imperfect, and even inherently evil.</p>
<p>Sexual myths have viewed menstruation as dirty, designing outrageous rituals around this natural process, from strange diets and prescriptions to mandated isolation and violent practices. Sexuality and desire in women has been viewed as taboo and dangerous, while child rearing is considered the highest calling. In Western history, women's health problems were often written off simply as an ""unsatisfied uterus,"" or ""hysteria"" of their weak and demon possessed bodies, while physical characteristics were used to label women as witches.</p>
<p>This fascinating, often maddening romp through the bedrooms and birthing rooms of time illustrates why women have been sexually ""enslaved,"" and reminds us that we've come a long way from the mythical virgin birth to women's liberation and beyond.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.94 Inches, Length: 6.45 Inches, Weight: 1.04058187664 Pounds, Width: 0.74 Inches",27.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/47/9781573922647.jpg,Success,71,22.1

Debates About Birth Control And Suffrage, A Declining Male Population And Expanding Female Workforce, The Emergence Of The New Woman, And Freudianism Were Among The Forces That Contributed To The Dadaist Enterprise.

Millions know Rand as one of this century's great thinkers, writers, and philosophers, yet much about the private Ayn Rand remains shrouded in mystery.<br> <br> Who was Ayn Rand?<br> <br> My Years with Ayn Rand charts the course of the clandestine, tempestuous relationship between the enigmatic author of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead and Nathaniel Branden-her young disciple and future pioneer of the self-esteem movement. In this book, discover the real Ayn Rand through the eyes of the man who became her soul mate and shared her passions and philosophical ideals.<br> <br> Their tragic and tumultuous love story began with a letter written by Branden as an admiring teenage fan and Anded, more than twenty years later, with accusations of betrayal and bitter recriminations. My Years with Ayn Rand paints an unforgettable portrait of Ayn Rand-whose ideas, even today, can generate a maelstrom of controversy.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>According to this devastating and often heavy-handed critique, Ayn Rand, whose novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged exposed millions to her philosophy of virtuous self-centeredness and capitalist freedom, was an oppressive personality whose Objectivist movement demonstrated all the classic elements of a destructive cult (its messianic leader and its separation of group members from family and friends). Walker presents his subject as an arrogant, dogmatic bully who brooked no criticism and as a repressed narcissist who feared her own emotions and hid behind a glorification of reason. He concludes that Rand was no more than a third-rate pop-novelist of propaganda fiction and that her ""vulgar Nietzschean"" philosophy's obsessive concern with the overachiever--who requires protection via absolutized individual rights--contributed to the movement's cultish aspects. Walker also savages self-esteem guru Nathaniel Branden, who was Rand's protege and extramarital lover; their explosive breakup in 1968 pulverized the Objectivist movement, whose contemporary schisms and crosscurrents he ploddingly tracks. In a vitriolic chapter on Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan--a one-time member of Rand's inner circle--Walker unpersuasively contends that this banker's ""inflation-obsessed"" policies grew out of Rand's theories. Those who find Rand's self-styled philosophy outre may not find much of interest in this scathing, albeit clumsy, expose. Others will find it a useful corrective to the Rand mystique. (Feb.) FYI: Branden's tell-all account of his affair with Rand and his role in the Objectivist movement is being reissued in a new edition in March as My Years with Ayn Rand: The Truth Behind the Myth (Jossey-Bass, $19 480p ISBN 0-7879-4513-7). While he does criticize Rand personally, his treatment differs from Walker's in that he still reveres her as a philosopher.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.153525 Inches, Length: 5.964555 Inches, Weight: 1.42418621252 Pounds, Width: 1.196848 Inches",36.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/38/9780787945138.jpg,Success,113,22.1

In Passing On, she applies her distinctive insight and consummate artistry to the subtle story of a domineering and manipulative mother's legacy to her children. With their mother's death, Helen and Edward, both middle-aged and both unmarried, are left to face the ramifications of their mother's hold on their lives for all of these years. Helen and Edward slowly learn to accept what has been lost in their own lives and embrace what can yet be retrieved. ""The richest and most rewarding of her novels."" - The Washington Post Book World<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Greystones is a moldy, drafty house of no great distinction located in the equally nondescript English town of Spaxton. The domineering and cantankerous Dorothy Glover has finally passed away, leaving her middle-aged progeny, Helen and Edward, to examine their lives, both past and future. It's a subtle plot and one that does well with Lively's ( The Road to Lichfield ) gently assured style. By revealing developments through small details--the discarded dishrags that mark the beginning of a relationship and the glimpse of a watch that signals its end--she delicately delineates the impact of love, scandal and turmoil. On the rare occasion when Lively gives reign to sweeping statements, as when the dramatic Louise comments on motherhood (``At the moments you wish you were shot of the whole thing you know perfectly well that it's precisely because you couldn't endure to be without it, now you know about it, that you've got to go through all this''), her writing doesn't quite ring true. But such instances are rare in this consistently engrossing tale.

What, then, can a reassessment of this contentious first lady of American letters add to an understanding of the gay identities that have emerged in America over the past century? As Marilee Lindemann shows in this study of the novelist's life and work, Cather's sexual coming-of-age occurred at a time when a cultural transition was recasting love between women as sexual deviance rather than romantic friendship. At the same time, the very identity of ""America"" was characterized by great instability as the United States emerged as a modern industrial nation and imperial power. Indeed, both terms, ""queer"" and ""America,"" achieved fresh ideological potency at the turn of the century. <i>Willa Cather: Queering America</i> is an enlightening unpacking of Cather's writings, from her controversial love letters of the 1890s--in which ""queer"" is employed to denote sexual deviance--to her epic novels, short stories, and critical writings. Lindemann points to the ""queer"" qualities of Cather's fiction--rebellion against traditional fictional form, with sometimes unlikable characters, lack of emphasis on heroic action, and lack of engagement in the drama of heterosexual desire.</p>

And in a loud revolutionary voice, I declare to the universe: the pain stops here.""</i> 
<p>Clinical psychologist Dr. Brenda Wade and coauthor Brenda Richardson ask their African American sisters to consider this question: ""What lessons about love and intimacy were passed down from your foremothers to you?"" In this provocative rethinking of the African American woman's experience, the authors suggest that African American women share an emotional legacy that began when their ancestors were dragged in chains to the ""New"" World and continued as their descendants suffered through the violence and humiliation of the Jim Crow period and later racism. Indeed, they argue, the long shadow cast by these historical events impacts romantic practice, lives can be transformed once there is a true understanding of the power of inherited beliefs.</p>
<p><i>What Mama Couldn't Tell Us About Love</i> shows how important it is to grieve and make peace with this brutal history. As you will see in this remarkable uplifting book, it is possible to use the positive messages inherent in the African American experience to create a better life. Learn from the ""Sisters Spirits""--well-known African Americans whose stories enliven these pages--as you move toward emotional freedom. Listen to the words of the spirituals interspersed in the text, enhance the coping skills and strengths your forebears harnessed to help themsurvive and prevail, and believe that emotional emancipation is your birthright.</p>
<p>Mama may not have told you all this in so many words--but there is no doubt that she would want to see you take these last steps toward freedom and abundant love.</p>

<p><i>""What Mama Couldn't Tell Us About Love</i> forces us to `wade in the water' of the grief and pain associated with the peculiar institution of slavery, and to confront our own denial about the emotional legacy of enslavement. Richardson and Wade offer us psychological baptism, deliverance from isolation, despair and old prejudices, psychic healing, and purification of the spirit. Lord knows, America needs this book.""(-- Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant, Ph.D., author of <i>The Best Kind of Loving</i>)</p>

Spearheaded by the noted sociologist Charles S. Johnson, it became, along with the N.A.A.C.P.'s Crisis magazine, one of the vehicles that drove the art and literature of the Harlem Renaissance. As a way of attracting writers such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, Johnson conducted literary contests that were largely funded by Casper Holstein, the infamous Harlem numbers gangster, who contributed several essays in addition to money.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dorothy West, Nella Larsen, and Arthur Schomburg were among Opportunity's contributors. Many of the pieces included in The Opportunity Reader have not been seen since their publication in the magazine, whose motto was &quot;Not alms, but opportunity.&quot;<br><br>The fertile artistic period now known as the Harlem Renaissance (1920-1930) gave birth to many of the world-renowned masters of black literature and is the model for today's renaissance of black writers.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The National Urban League's Opportunity magazine, edited by sociologist Charles S. Johnson, was one of the most important journals published during the Harlem Renaissance. Though its circulation was often dwarfed by its larger competitor, the NAACP's The Crisis, Opportunity served as the training ground for many New Negro authors. Wilson (The Crisis Reader) has done a service to those interested in black literature and culture by bringing together stories, poems, plays, reviews, and essays from some of the leading contributors to Opportunity, including Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen, and Eric Walrond. Most interesting, perhaps, are the more obscure pieces such as the stories of John F. Matheus and Arthur Huff Fauset. Wilson provides a helpful if somewhat brief introduction, discussing Johnson--who believed that demonstrating black literary and intellectual achievements would improve conditions for the race--and outlining the history and significance of Opportunity.--Louis J.

0-8078-4812-3,Rank Ladies: Gender and Cultural Hierarchy in American Vaudeville (Gender and American Culture),"Kibler, M. Alison",The University of North Carolina Press,288,5/31/1999,,Paperback,"<p><br>An illuminating study of vaudeville, this book shows how women&#151;as performers, patrons, and workers&#151;influenced its rise and fall as America's favorite form of live entertainment.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>These two volumes examine the historical impact of women in the entertainment industry, offering perceptive comments about American culture in the process. Sochen (history, Northeastern Illinois Univ.) divides performers into various groups: black women vaudevillians, bawdy women entertainers, the entertainer as reformer, child stars, and women comics, to name a few. She examines a potpourri of stars within these contexts, including the details of their careers, the obstacles they encountered, their personal histories, their impact on the public, and their relevance to the eras in which they performed. Many were symbolic of Eve (the seductress), Mary (sweet and innocent), or Lillith (the career woman), while others violated these conventional female boundaries. Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Ethel Waters, Mae West, Eva Tanguay, Shirley Temple, Dinah Shore, and Roseanne Barr are among those discussed. Popular entertainment collections should find this work useful. Rank Ladies, on the other hand, focuses more exclusively on women in vaudeville, discussing their history, specialties, difficulties, and triumphs as well as their place in society in the early part of this century. Women performers gradually introduced more complex elements to the vaudeville stage--e.g., classical music, satire, theatrical adaptations, and inventive material--that challenged previous standards. Curiously, this produced a mix that was at once successful, provocative, and threatening, changing the composition of audiences, the philosophies of theater managers, the texture of the vaudeville art form, and the nature of the entertainers' work environment. Kibler (Ctr. for Women's Studies, Australian National Univ.) has done an impressive job not only of researching her subject but also of fluidly weaving it into a valuable and entertaining narrative from which she draws perceptive insights and conclusions on the culture of the time that are relevant in any age.

These examinations, especially in the form of narrative inquiry, life histories and deconstructive language practices such as discourse analysis, figure prominently in breaking silences and giving voice to the many tensions that women experience in the academic workplace and other settings.<i>Everyday Knowledge and Uncommon Truths: Women of the Academy</i> is a thirteen chapter volume which draws on the life experience and varied backgrounds of academic women from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Offering diverse perspectives on women’s experiences of being and knowing in and outside the academy, contributors draw on a range of critical approaches derived from feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, critical education theory, discourse theory and analysis, narrative inquiry and life histories. Topics examined include: the ways home and domestic matters impinge on academic life; the constraints on women becoming educated; the contradictions surrounding teaching and teaching practices; the background factors that shape research and writing; and women’s activism within and beyond the academy.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/15/9780813334615.jpg,Success,104,22.1

These essays provide a compelling view of many of the major trends in social theory over the past fifteen years-trends that Linda Nicholson herself helped to shape.The Play of Reason examines the legacies of modernity in contemporary political, social, and feminist thought and the unraveling of these legacies in postmodern times. Linda Nicholson first focuses on the tension in modern social theory between attempts to recognize change and diversity and struggles to capture such change in overarching frameworks of meaning and value. She illuminates the consequences of these conflicting tendencies in relation to Marxism, feminist theory, and classical liberal accounts of the family and the state. Nicholson then asks how theory and the resolution of difference are possible after such overarching frameworks are abandoned.

Her tenth book consists of a single long poem whose sentences, segments and prose-blocks weave loosely around and about, and grow out of, a road trip through the rural South. Clipped twangs, lyrical goblets of magnolialight, and recurrent, mysterious, semi-allegorical figures like the snakeman and the boneman share space with place names, lexicographies, exhortations and wacky graffiti (God is Louise). Wright alternates private references with clear allusions, as when images of eye enucleations and glass eyes culminate in a flurry of bits from King Lear. Deepstep teems with wry, rich sentences no one else could have written: I left my chicory-blue swimsuit back at the motel where the baseball team cannonballed us out of the pool. She leaps exhilaratingly among verbal registers--from kenatoprosthesis to trailer skirt, from Arkansas toe and pinball to Ultima Thule. And she loves double meanings--Morning glories. What's yours. Her uncharacteristically extroverted, ethnographic project also shows her sense of humor--Her Aunt Flo said she hadn't had any in so long she'd done growed back together. In sorting these glittering, interlocking fragments of self-conscious Southern poetry, preposterous as a wedding dress, some readers will wish Wright had included notes, or explained her extensive back story; but no one will need more information to cherish Wright's latest once-and-for-all thing, opaque and revelatory, ceaselessly burning.

0-415-92169-4,The Queer Sixties,Patricia Juliana Smith,Routledge,272,5/14/1999,,Paperback,"<p><b>The Queer Sixties</b> assembles an impressive group of cultural critics to go against the grain of 1960s studies, and proposes new and different ways of the last decade before the closet doors swung open. Imbued with the zeitgeist of the 60s, this playful and powerful collection rescues the persistence of the queer imaginary.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The bold premise of Smith's anthology is that contemporary lesbian and gay culture did not begin in June 1969 with the Stonewall riots. These 14 essays by ""scholars trained as literary critics"" do not form a social history, but ""employ the methodologies of textual criticism to `read' the queer iconography"" present in much 1960s culture. Smith's contributors cover both obvious subjects--lesbian pulp novels, the British playwright Joe Orton and Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band--and surprising ones: Valerie Solanas and the S.C.U.M. Manifesto, Dusty Springfield's career and the homoeroticism of Jim Morrison. Smith's instinct that representations of homosexuality were not only prevalent in 1960s culture but clearly set the stage for the gay liberation movement is persuasive, and her choice of topics expands the parameters of how ""queer culture"" is conceptualized. At their best, the essays make astonishing, even brilliant associative leaps. In ""Give Us a Kiss,"" Ann Shillinglaw links surrealism and sexual alienation in her dissection of the homoeroticism of the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night. In ""Myra Breckenridge and the Pathology of Heterosexuality,"" Douglas Eisner uses New Left politics and feminism to explicate Gore Vidal's work. Unfortunately, many of the essays are shot through with the jargon of postmodern critical theory (""Solanas's attempt to resignify `scum' in her manifesto must take into account its previous use by dominant discourses""), which may diminish the readership for this notable collection of essays.

The formation of an early African American community, bound together by shared experiences and spiritual values, owed much to these women's voices. The significance of their writings would be profound for all African Americans' sense of their own identity as a people.Katherine Clay Bassard's book is the first detailed account of pre-Emancipation writings from the period of 1760 to 1863, in light of a developing African American religious culture and emerging free black communities. Her study--which examines the relationship among race, culture, and community--focuses on four women&#58; the poet Phillis Wheatley and poet and essayist Ann Plato, both Congregationalists; and the itinerant preacher Jarena Lee, and Shaker eldress Rebecca Cox Jackson, who, with Lee, had connections with African Methodism.Together, these women drew on what Bassard calls a spirituals matrix, which transformed existing literary genres to accommodate the spiritual music and sacred rituals tied to the African diaspora. Bassard's important illumination of these writers resurrects their path-breaking work.

When, at age eight, Emma encounters her first falcon, she is mesmerized.

Incorporating all of Jane Rule's early work-including unpublished manuscripts, letters, magazine and newspaper columns, as well as fan mail she received-Schuster also draws on interviews, conversations, and personal encounters with the author to elicit the ways in which Rule interrogates the meanings and politics of sexuality, the relationship between sexuality and language, and the stakes of communities in individual claims on identity.</p>

Limiting her interviews to several dozen women living near her home in the Cambridge, Mass., area, Ludtke does not offer a definitive analysis, but her skilled anecdotal research, buttressed by academic studies, gives a human face to a social phenomenon that deserves attention. Because teenage mothers often lack financial resources, their daily lives can differ significantly from those of older single mothers. But Ludtke notes similarities as well between the two groups, such as the feeling that motherhood will make their lives more meaningful and a concern that their offspring relate to positive male figures. Ludtke argues poignantly that adolescent pregnancy will be prevented only when adults develop ""the patience and perseverance to stick with troubled youth across the span of their adolescence.""</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 8.7 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 1.60055602212 Pounds, Width: 1.22 Inches",33.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/07/9780520218307.jpg,Success,88,22.1

<p>In a dazzling career that spans more than two decades, Reba McEntire has established herself as one of the hardest-working and most successful entertainers of our time. She is a country music superstar who has sold more than 40 million records, one of the highest-grossing concert performers of the decade, and a trailblazing businesswoman who established her own multimedia entertainment corporation.</p>
<p>Yet Reba has still managed to become one of the rare celebrities who is also beloved by her millions of fans for the way she lives her life, for successfully balancing the demands of career and family, for competing in show business without sacrificing her values, and for managing to ""keep in country"" while keeping up with the times. She has done so, in a large part, by drawing wisdom and strength from the precious traditions of her country past, finding inspiring new relevance in old-fashioned values.</p>
<p>Now, in a deeply personal, ""back-porch conversation"" of a book, Reba shares a generous helping of her life experiences. ""I hope some of the things I've gone through can make it just a little easier for the next person, because life is supposed to be about making the path a little gentler for the people traveling behind you.""</p>
<p>Reba writes about the roles a modern country woman tries to fulfill, roles as many and varied as the fabric pieces of an heirloom quilt. Facing the challenges of being a wife, mother, stepmother, daughter, sister, performer, executive, community member, and Christian, Reba shows how she has coped by carrying forward lessons and a guiding spirit from her roots as a ranch girl growing up in Chockie, Oklahoma, as well as from the powerful heritage of classic country music. Rather than proving quaint and stale, Reba demonstrates again and again the ways that you can make traditional values remain fresh and vital in your search for a fulfilling life today.</p>
<p><i>Comfort From a Country Quilt</i> is a book of wisdom and encouragement and a celebration of what is true and lasting in our lives, a gift for yourself and for those you love to cherish.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6503636729 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/44/9780553107944.jpg,Success,94,22.1

Works by women artists within the Pre-Raphaelite style have, however, largely been forgotten and ignored in the history of the movement. This book, published to accompany an exhibition in Manchester, England, brings together paintings, drawings, photographs, and other works that women contributed to the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Many are reproduced and documented here for the first time. Spanning three generations from the 1840s to the early 1900s, the artists include Barbara Bodichon, Anna Howitt, Rosa Brett, Anna Blunden, Jane Benham Hay, Joanna Boyce, Elizabeth Siddal, Rebecca Solomon, Emma Sandys, Julia Margaret Cameron, Lucy and Catherine Madox Brown, Marie Spartali Stillman, Maria Zambaco, Francesca Alexander, Evelyn De Morgan, Kate Bunce, Marianne Stokes, Christina Herringham, and Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale. Their works demonstrate that Pre-Raphaelitism is a broader historical movement than has previously been recognized and that women were active in all its phases. Their re-inclusion in Pre-Raphaelite history will redefine its scope, concerns, and achievements, as well as restore a wealth of neglected works to public attention.",en,"First Edition, U.S., Softcover","Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/48/9780500281048.jpg,Success,50,22.1

For Rosezella Maynette Fisher, outspoken sister girl and controversial Dean of Students at Harvard Law School, it was murder. And the debonair new President of Harvard is a prime suspect. A Darker Shade of Crimson is a novel about how Ella Fisher ended up dead on the first day of the fall semester, and how her friend Veronica (Nikki) Chase - a smart, ambitious, attractive, and well-connected black economics professor - sets out to solve the crime, and in the process uncovers some of Harvard's most deeply buried secrets. At twenty-eight, Nikki is a rising star, the only black professor in Harvard's economics department. After stumbling over Ella Fisher's body during a blackout in a classroom building, she is quickly plunged into the investigation of her death. With the occasional tip from Raphael Griffin, a Harvard policeman, Nikki learns that plenty of people could have wanted Ella dead. Only two people seem to mourn Ella's passing: her blue-blooded, Wellesley-educated secretary, Lindsey Wentworth; and Ella's best girlfriend, Alix Coulter, an actress from Texas with attitude. With their help, Nikki sets out to unravel simultaneously the mystery of Ella's death and the complications of her own love life. Dante Rosario, her long-lost ex-boyfriend, turns up and sets off a chemical reaction; meanwhile, Justin Simms, a Harvard Law School student who flirts like a master, won't take no for an answer. It takes the combined wisdom of Nikki's landlady, Magnolia Dailey, and her best friend, Jessica Leiberman, to help her understand her own heart as she drives toward the shocking conclusion that will turn all of Harvard on its ear.",en,First Edition,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",6.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/08/9780671016708.jpg,Success,56,22.1

On the cotton farms of Central Texas, women's labor was essential. In addition to working untold hours in the fields, women shouldered most family responsibilities: keeping house, sewing clothing, cultivating and cooking food, and bearing and raising children. But despite their contributions to the southern agricultural economy, rural women's stories have remained largely untold.</p>
<p>Using oral history interviews and written memoirs, Rebecca Sharpless weaves a moving account of women's lives on Texas cotton farms. She examines how women from varying ethnic backgrounds—German, Czech, African American, Mexican, and Anglo-American—coped with difficult circumstances. The food they cooked, the houses they kept, the ways in which they balanced field work with housework, all yield insights into the twentieth-century South. And though rural women's lives were filled with routines, many of which were undone almost as soon as they were done, each of their actions was laden with importance, says Sharpless, for the welfare of a woman's entire family depended heavily upon her efforts.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.73413933246 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches",25.8,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/02/9780807847602.jpg,Success,90,22.1

I'm too fat. I've got to lose some weight. I'll never get a professional acting job if I'm that fat. And even though there were times when they'd actually say nice things about my acting, like: 'Camryn, that was great, really nice job,' I, of course, interpreted it as, 'Camryn, your acting in that scene was much less fat, that's the kind of slender acting we like to see.' That was my goal. To be a fat-free actor.""—<i>Camryn Manheim</i> 
<p>Thankfully, Camryn Manheim has never played by the rules. Her fierce determination to defy the beauty myth, the naysayers, and casting stereotypes has resulted in one of today's most remarkable and unique Hollywood success stories.</p>
<p>""This is for all the fat girls!"" Manheim proudly proclaimed to the world in 1998 when she won the Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the popular ABC-TV drama ""The Practice."" But it took her decades to let go of the self-loathing and make peace with her body. <i>Wake Up, I'm Fat!</i> is Manheim's defiant, frank, poignant, and wildly funny account of growing up fat in a thin-obsessed culture...and thriving. ""This is my journey,"" says Manheim, ""from victim to victor.""</p>
<p>Born in New Jersey and raised in the Midwest, Manheim grew up in the late 1960s in a family of suburban Jewish activists who placed a premium on education. Her life changed at the age of 11, when her family moved to southern California. In this sun-soaked mecca, Manheim experienced culture shock: People shopped for groceries in bikinis! Soon she met a ""friend,"" a dependable source of protection and comfort: her fat. And ""he"" stuck with her. (Manheim always thinks ofher fat as male. ""I know it says something about me that I consider the personification of my fat to be male,"" she confides, ""but over the years I've realized that its tyranny is quintessentially masculine."") Through the summer of her 16th year, when she happily worked as a buxom wench at the Renaissance Faire; her undergraduate days at UC Santa Cruz, when she rode a motorcycle and discovered that she <i>wasn't</i> a lesbian; her years as a tortured drama student at New York University, when a professor named Dick asked, ""What are you doing about your body?"" Manheim's fat remained constant. ""I view my fat as Mussolini,"" she says. ""It is a terrible oppressor that makes the shame run on time.""</p>
<p>Pulsing with outrage and humor, <i>Wake Up, I'm Fat!</i> captures the battle for both self- and social acceptance fought by women with less than model-thin bodies. Throughout, Manheim candidly shares her own personal moments of shock and anger, shame and despair. Yet she also reveals her triumphs and revelations—including the joy of connecting with other wonderful big women.</p>
<p>Recalling the sting of society's judgmental scorn—especially when embodied by would-be employers and would-be lovers—Manheim ponders, ""It's against all odds that I've managed to arrive in my mid-thirties with any self-respect and self-worth. It's a miracle that I laugh every day and walk through my life with pride and confidence, because our culture is unrelenting when it comes to large people."" But she's a survivor and a woman with a mission: ""I have chosen to spend all of my positive energy on changing the world's perception of fat people. I am proud to carry a torch in the battle for fat acceptance. But it's just one of a million torches that need to be lit and held high.""</p>
<p>A heartfelt and spirited personal memoir, and a wake-up call to the fat and ""unfat"" alike, <i>Wake Up, I'm Fat!</i> will make readers laugh, think, and perhaps light a torch of their own.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/22/9780767903622.jpg,Success,95,22.1

Only by balancing the four aspectsspiritual, mental, emotional, and physicalcan people be successful and fulfilled. Each chapter investigates one of these aspects and ends with appropriate spiritual exercises. A minister for over 30 years who has conducted seminars on spiritual healing, Grayson by contrast stresses 13 principles for self-healing. Emphasizing that everyone has the ability to lead a happy, fulfilled life, Grayson claims that most people's lives are instead run by lack, loss, and limitation as well as resistance, rejection, and rebellion. Likening it to training for a marathon, Grayson discusses the great effort required to release past negativity and to prepare the path for spiritual healing. The appendix is complete with positive affirmations for spiritual treatments and a glossary of terms.

Moreover, while feminist ethics, which explore the theory of care and noncontractual values such as trust and responsibility, are increasingly linked to political theory, there appears to be a reluctance to relate this moral theory to the specific questions of international or global political theory.In <i>Globalizing Care,</i> Fiona Robinson successfully weaves feminist theory and ethics with international relations.

0-231-10849-4,Gay Science,"Murphy, Timothy",Columbia University Press,320,4/15/1999,,Paperback,"<p><i>Gay Science</i> is the first comprehensive examination of the ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation research. Bioethicist Timothy Murphy presents the views of many gay men and women who detect ominous motives behind this research. If a genetic marker were discovered for homosexual tendencies would genetic screening be used to further discriminate against gay people? If a method for changing sexual orientation were developed would it would be forced upon gay adults, or children whose parents suspected they might grow up to be gay. Given the potential for its misuse, is sexual orientation research fundamentally unethical?</p>
<p>Murphy acknowledges that much of sexual orientation research to date has been bad science, questionable in its motives and methodologically unsound. He examines the social and historical conditions, from the 1880s to the present, that spawned this research and reviews the findings that have often perpetuated confusion about homosexuality. He assesses five major studies on sexual orientation undertaken in the 1990s, from neuroanatomist Simon leVay's study of certain brain structures in gay men to the work of psychologist Joseph Nicolosi. He questions the flawed and simplistic assumptions about sexuality made by much of this research, Murphy argues that a true science of sexual orientation would not be focused exclusively upon homosexuality nor presuppose its pathology.</p>
<p>Throughout the book Murphy argues that concerns about the potential misuses of this research do not justify its prohibition. Tackling gay science's most troubling aspects, he contends that if this research leads to the development of effective sexual orientation therapies, informed adults should have the choice to undergo them; he also examines the factors that weigh in favor of a parental right to choose or attempt to influence the sexual orientation of a child, and the ethical limits to such a right.</p>
<p>Pointing to the potential benefits of sexual orientation research as well as acknowledging its potential for harm, Murphy ultimately defends gay science in the name of free scientific inquiry. <i>Gay Science</i> argues that the way to ensure the future of gay people is not through censoring sexual orientation research but through working toward a society which uses reseach as a way of dinstinguishing myth from fact and not as an instrument of discrimination.</p>

Living most of her adult life in a spiritual community with author and meditation teacher Eknath Easwaran, Flinders has contemplated the works of women mystics including Julian of Norwich, Teresa of Avila and Clare of Assisi. But how can these women's (and her own) experiences of peace and God jibe with the often angry feminist Flinders finds herself to be? In historical context, she examines today's sexism and violence against womenthe legacy of patriarchy that, she says, is not a natural condition at alland uncovers parallels between Gandhi's Indian revolution against British colonialism and the challenges facing Western women today. Flinders concludes that reclaiming the ancient sacred feminine is not at odds with political feminism, but rather necessary for it. In the spirit of Women Who Run with the Wolves and Reviving Ophelia, this book has the potential to change women's lives. $30,000 ad/promo; author tour.

But how did the lady get on her pedestal-and were the lives of white southern women always so different from those of their northern contemporaries? In her ambitious new book, Cynthia A. Kierner charts the evolution of the lives of white southern women through the colonial, revolutionary, and early republican eras. Using the lady on her pedestal as the end-rather than the beginning-of her story, she shows how gentility, republican political ideals, and evangelical religion successively altered southern gender ideals and thereby forced women to reshape their public roles. Kierner concludes that southern women continually renegotiated their access to the public sphere-and that even the emergence of the frail and submissive lady as icon did not obliterate women's public role.Kierner draws on a strong overall command of early American and women's history and adds to it research in letters, diaries, newspapers, secular and religious periodicals, travelers' accounts, etiquette manuals, and cookery books. Focusing on the issues of work, education, and access to the public sphere, she explores the evolution of southern gender ideals in an important transitional era. Specifically, she asks what kinds of changes occurred in women's relation to the public sphere from 1700 to 1835. In answering this major question, she makes important links and comparisons, across both time and region, and creates a chronology of social and intellectual change that addresses many key questions in the history of women, the South, and early America.",en,801,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.97 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/29/9780801484629.jpg,Success,82,22.1

The event marked a milestone in space, but for Donna Shirley, the leader of the mostly male team that designed and built Sojourner--and the first woman ever to manage a NASA program--it marked a triumph of another kind.

From her seemingly outlandish aspiration at age ten to build aircraft, to abandoning high school Home Ec in favor of mechanical drawing, and, at sixteen, becoming a licensed pilot, Shirley defied expectations from the beginning. In a vivid narrative, rich with anecdotes and thrilling turning points, Shirley recounts the intense battles she waged to defend her vision and the ingenuity and resourcefulness of her committed team. Her moment-by-cliffhanging-moment account of Pathfinder's landing and Sojourner's first tentative foray across the sands of Mars brilliantly captures the fulfillment of a lifelong dream as it heralds a brave new era of space exploration.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7936641432 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",12.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/10/9780767902410.jpg,Success,95,22.1
0-8223-2342-7,Out Takes: Essays on Queer Theory and Film (Series Q),"Hanson, Ellis",Duke University Press Books,376,5/3/1999,,Paperback,"<p>This collection brings together the work of both film scholars and queer theorists to advance a more sophisticated notion of queer film criticism. While the “politics of representation” has been the focus of much previous gay and lesbian film criticism, the contributors to <i>Out Takes</i> employ the approaches of queer theory to move beyond conventional readings and to reexamine aspects of the cinematic gaze in relation to queer desire and spectatorship.</p>
<p>The essays examine a wide array of films, including <i>Calamity Jane</i>, <i>Rear Window,</i> <i>The Hunger</i>, <i>Heavenly Creatures</i>, and <i>Bound</i> , and discuss such figures as Doris Day, Elizabeth Taylor, and Alfred Hitchcock. Divided into three sections, the first part reconsiders the construction of masculinity and male homoerotic desire—especially with respect to the role of women—in classic cinema of the 1940s and 1950s. The second section offers a deconstructive consideration of lesbian film spectatorship and lesbian representation. Part three looks at the historical trajectory of independent queer cinema, including works by H.D., Kenneth Anger, and Derek Jarman.</p>
<p>By exploring new approaches to the study of sexuality in film, <i>Out Takes</i> will be useful to scholars in gay and lesbian studies, queer theory, and cinema studies.</p>

Her revelation prompted appearances on Oprah and Dateline NBC, and she began to receive letters, calls, and E-mail from hundreds of women who told of their own experiences and were desperate for more information. They, too, were going through a loss of libido and were glad to know they were not alone. When Ferrare went to her doctor, she found that a lack of testosterone in her body was a key reason for her lack of interest in sex, and the doctor prescribed a testosterone cream that put her back in the mood - and thrilled her husband. But spurred by her approaching menopause, she wanted to find out for herself how hormone levels affect everything in our bodies - and how everything we do and eat affects our hormone levels. Ferrare came to the conclusion that a natural approach to balancing her hormones made sense for her. Now Ferrare offers a frank, funny, informative, and inspiring personal account of what she went through - and what she learned along the way.",en,,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/92/9781582380292.jpg,Success,109,22.1

She describes them in all their forms, with particular attention to the differential treatment given never-married and divorced single parents, and to the impact of gender, race, and class. Emphasizing that all families face significant conflicts between work and family responsibilities - a conflict thrown in sharp relief in single-parent families - Dowd argues many two-parent families in fact function as single-parent care-giving households. The success or failure of families, she contends, has little to do with form. Many of the problems faced by single-parent families mirror problems faced by all families. Illustrating the harmful impact of current laws concerning divorce, welfare, and employment, Dowd makes a powerful case for centering policy around the welfare and equality of all children.

<p>When Simon Callow, the celebrated stage and screen star, first met Margaret Ramsay in 1980, he could hardly have suspected that his encounter with the world-famous theatrical agent would blossom into a most improbable love affair. There was age, for one thing: Callow was barely thirty; Ramsay was seventy. Also, Callow, a homosexual, was in the midst of an all-consuming affair with his Egyptian-Turkish boyfriend, Aziz Yehia. For the next eleven years, until her death in 1991, Callow and Ramsay conducted an intense, exhilarating liaison in meetings and letters, exchanging intimacies charged with the fervor of trembling emotion. In this extraordinary memoir, Callow tells the story of their unusual relationship in a book that captures the fiery intensity and reckless gestures, the bliss, tenderness, and grace, as well as the anguish, of overwhelming love in its compulsive course, which also comes to embrace, in a tragic mnage trois, Callow's lover, Aziz.</p>
<p>With the most graceful of touches Callow paints a memorable portrait of a fascinating woman-her beauty, vitality, brilliance, and effervescence. <i>Love Is Where It Falls</i> is by turns moving, inspiring, funny, and heartbreaking, with a sense of intimacy so overpowering that the reader feels privileged to be allowed to trespass on such personal pleasure and pain.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.92 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/92/9780880642392.jpg,Success,98,22.1

Is this self-segregation a problem we should try to fix, or a coping strategy we should support? How can we get past our reluctance to talk about racial issues to even discuss it? And what about the other questions we and our children have about race?Beverly Daniel Tatum is a renowned authority on the psychology of racism. She asserts that we do not know how to talk about our racial differences: Whites are afraid of using the wrong words and being perceived as “racist.” Parents of color are afraid of exposing their children to painful racial realities too soon. Tatum understands that the vocabulary of race is loaded and that embarrassment and awkwardness often stymie conversations about this subject; yet, she believes that these obstacles can and must be overcome if we are to bring about change.In <i>“Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?” And Other Conversations About Race,</i> Dr. Tatum provides us with a new way of thinking and talking about race through the lens of racial identity. She explains that all of us have a racial identity and must strive to affirm it. For people of color, the development of a constructive racial identity requires being able to recognize and reject the bombardment of negative stereotypes and to embrace a history of resistance and empowerment rather than passive victimization. For Whites, the challenge is to engage in a process of racial identity development which leads to an awareness of White privilege and a determination to actively work against injustice—and this requires the strength to reject a system that awards them, and to reclaim the legacy of White allies. For many, this is uncharted territory. This book provides a road map for those who want to make the journey and better understand the racial dynamics of their daily lives.Tatum extends her ideas about racial identity development beyond the usual Black-White paradigm to embrace the unique circumstances of Latinos, American Indians, Asians, as well as biracial youth. Also included is a list of resources for further reading as well as a list of books for parents and teachers to recommend to children of all ages.Using real-life examples and the latest research, Tatum presents strong evidence that straight talk about our racial identities—whatever they may be—is essential if we are serious about facilitating communication across racial and ethnic divides. We have waited far too long to begin our conversations about race. This remarkable book, infused with great wisdom and humanity, tells us where to start.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",14,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/94/9780465091294.jpg,Success,105,22.1

0-226-56849-0,Gay Men's Friendships : Invincible Communities,"Nardi, Peter M.",University of Chicago Press,264,7/15/1999,,Paperback,"<p><P>Based on surveys and interviews of two hundred gay men, Peter Nardi's new study presents the first book-length examination of contemporary urban gay men's friendships. Expertly weaving historical and sociological research on friendship with firsthand information, Nardi argues that friendship is the central organizing element of gay men's lives. Through friendship, gay identities and communities are created, transformed, maintained, and reproduced. <br><br>Nardi explores the meaning of friends to some gay men, how friends often become a surrogate family, how sexual behavior and attraction affects these friendships, and how, for many, friends mean more and last longer than romantic relationships. While looking at the psychological joys and sorrows of friendship, he also considers the cultural constraints limiting gay men in contemporary urban America&#8212;especially those that deal with dominant images of masculinity and heterosexuality&#8212;and how they relate to friendship. <br><br>By listening to gay men talk about their interactions, Nardi offers a rare glimpse into the mechanisms of gay life. We learn how gay men meet their friends, what they typically do and talk about, and how these strong relationships contain the roots of larger cultural forces such as social movements and gay identities and neighborhoods. Nardi also points out the political and social consequences when friendships fail to provide support against oppression. <br><br>An intimate and informative look at gay life in urban America, <i>Gay Men's Friendships</i> ultimately shows how these relationships challenge the gender order of our society by questioning how masculinity is constructed and by offering a modelfor a more creative blending of gay and heterosexual masculinity.<br><br><br><br></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Exploring what Hannah Arendt called ""the political relevance of friendship,"" Nardi, a professor of sociology at Claremont College, argues that a tremendous amount of gay political organizing emerges from the bonds between gay men. Although he contends that gay male friendships are ""poorly understood"" and ""not easily explained,"" he claims that friendship is the primary community institution for urban gay men. In addition to a review of the existing literature of male friendship (from Aristotle and Cicero to current popular and scholarly work), Nardi offers his own research findings, based on 161 questionnaires and 30 face-to-face interviews. While many of his conclusions seem like obvious common sense (such as his claim that many gay men choose not to have sex with their friends for fear of losing the friendship), he also offers some provocative flashes of insight (for example, that gay men's social circles have become less diverse in terms of class and race as political groups and social venues have proliferated and become more specialized). While Nardi attempts a blend of sociology and cultural history, overall, the latter element is more successful; when he lets his subjects speak, the book vibrates with lived experience. In particular, his discussions of the legal ramifications of gay men creating ""family"" out of friendships (e.g., friends do not have the legal rights to visit the critically ill in a hospital) are important contributions to the growing literature of gay sociology.

<p>Why would an articulate, intelligent, thoughtful young women shave off most of her hair, dye the remainder green, shape it into a mohawk, and glue it onto her head? What attracts girls to male-dominated youth subcultures like the punk movement? What role does the subculture play in their perceptions of themselves, and in their self-esteem? How do girls reconcile a subcultural identity that is deliberately coded “masculine” with the demands of femininity?</p>
<p>Research has focused on the ways media and cultural messages victimize young women, but little attention has been paid to the ways they resist these messages. In Pretty in Punk, Lauraine Leblanc examines what happens when girls ignore these cultural messages, parody ideas of beauty, and refuse to play the games of teenage femininity. She explores the origins and development of the punk subculture, the processes by which girls decide to “go punk,” patterns of resistance to gender norms, and tactics girls use to deal with violence and harassment.</p>
<p>Pretty in Punk takes readers into the lives of girls living on the margins of contemporary culture. Drawing on interviews with 40 girls and women between the ages of 14-37, Leblanc examines the lives of her subjects, illuminating their forms of rebellion and survival. Pretty in Punk lets readers hear the voices of these women as they describe the ways their&nbsp; constructions of femininity—from black lipstick to slamdancing—allow them to reject damaging cultural messages and build strong identities. The price they pay for resisting femininity can be steep—girls tell of parental rejection, school expulsion, institutionalization,&nbsp; and harassment. Leblanc illuminates punk girls’ resistance to adversity, their triumphs over tough challenges, and their work to create individual identities in a masculine world.</p>

0-300-07680-0,Sight Unseen,"Kleege, Georgina",Yale University Press,304,3/11/1999,,Hardcover,"<p>This book offers an unexpected and unprecedented account of blindness and sight. Legally blind since the age of eleven, Georgina Kleege draws on her experiences to offer a detailed testimony of visual impairment - both her own view of the world and the world's view of the blind.. ""Kleege describes the negative social status of the blind, analyzes stereotypes of the blind that have been perpetuated by movies, and discusses how blindness has been portrayed in literature. She vividly conveys the visual experience of someone with severely impaired sight and explains what she can see and what she cannot (and how her inability to achieve eye contact - in a society that prizes that form of connection - has affected her). Finally she tells of the various ways she reads, and the freedom she felt when she stopped concealing her blindness and acquired skills, such as reading braille, as part of a new, blind identity. Without sentimentality or cliches, Kleege offers us the opportunity to imagine life without sight.</p> <h3>Literary Review Magazine - Anthony Storr</h3> <p>This is a fascinating account of how determination, courage and intelligence can surmount a dreadful affliction. Those who read it will find that their attitude to the blind has been permanently altered, which is what the author intended.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 0.91 Inches, Length: 8.57 Inches, Weight: 0.9590108397 Pounds, Width: 5.82 Inches",40,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/06/9780300076806.jpg,Success,90,22.1

Simons offers a unique perspective on Beauvoir’s wide-ranging contribution to twentieth-century thought. She details the discovery of the origins of Beauvoir's existential philosophy in her handwritten diary from 1927; uncovers evidence of the sexist exclusion of Beauvoir from the philosophical canon; reveals evidence that the African-American writer Richard Wright provided Beauvoir with the theoretical model of oppression that she used in The Second Sex; shows the influence of The Second Sex in transforming Sartre's philosophy and in laying the theoretical foundations of radical feminism; and addresses feminist issues of racism, motherhood, and lesbian identity. Simons also draws on her experience as a Women’s Liberation organizer as she witnessed how women used The Second Sex in defining the foundations of radical feminism.

These essays deal with everything from finding a mentor -whether it's an Olympic gold winner or a neighborhood coach-to reveling in female team spirit. There are historical selections, as well as discussions of such developments as Title IX. The contributors, including world-class athletes and celebrated writers from Mariah Burton Nelson and Grace Butcher to Diane Ackerman and Maxine Kumin, tackle traditional favorites such as basketball and softball as well as more exotic sports from boxing and motorcycle racing to rock climbing. <P> Both timely and riveting, <i>Whatever It Takes</i> will appeal to the rapidly growing ranks of female athletes and to their enthusiastic followers.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>A companion to A Whole Other Ball Game, in which Sandoz collected women's short fiction on women's sports, this book collects women's essays (and some poetry) on the same subject. The authors of the 56 pieces include Diane Ackerman, Annie Dillard, Grace Butcher, Mariah Burton Nelson, Maxine Kumin, and Jewelle Gomez. Although the book covers the expected wide range of athletics, the writing is so superb that it does not feel as if the pieces were selected just to be representative. Standout essays include Teresa Leo's self-deprecating Seconds, about her high-school decision to leave her dead-end Pennsylvania mining town, and Megan McNamer's Longing and Bliss, about the importance of basketball in her life despite its being a boys-only sport in her youth. The few short historical pieces included seem pale by comparison. More suited to public libraries, this book could also be added to women's studies collections in academic libraries.

Ordinary people plunge into insurmountable personal debt and fall prey to dangerous webs of underground creditors-so dangerous, in fact, that murder may be the only way out. A beautiful young woman vanishes, and the detective quickly finds she is not whom she claims to be. Is she a victim, a killer, or both? In a country that tracks its citizens at every turn, how can two women claim the same identity and then disappear without a trace?<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The horror in this beautifully fashioned tale of stolen identity lies not in the cold-blooded crimes but in the motive-a desperate hunger for consumer goods. Shunsuke Honma, a widowed 43-year-old Tokyo police inspector with a 10-year-old son, is on disability leave. The boring cycle of idleness punctuated by painful physical therapy sessions comes to a halt when a nephew asks for Honma's help in finding his missing fiance, whom he knows as Shoko Sekine. As Honma's search intensifies, he realizes the fiance had actually assumed Sekine's identity and possibly killed her. For the American reader, the jewel in this enormously compelling novel is the portrait of working- and middle-class Japanese getting caught in a cycle of astronomical personal debt in order to enjoy the good life. Also eye-opening is Japan's elaborate registry system for keeping track of its citizenry. In order to become Shoko Sekine, the impostor had to perpetrate an ingeniously elaborate series of hoaxes and lies. Honma is tenacious, methodical, an attentive listener with a retentive memory and the ability to connect disparate bits of information. The trail takes him back through the real Sekine's history and into the life of the other woman, whose family ran afoul of vicious loan sharks. Miyabe drives her complex plot with spare prose, combining expert pacing and psychological nuance to ultimately haunting effect. (Feb.)

Refuting the idea that no American detective fiction of substance was produced between the times of Edgar Allan Poe and Dashiell Hammett, Catherine Ross Nickerson shows how these women writers blended Gothic elements into domestic fiction to create a unique and all-but-ignored subgenre that she labels 'domestic detective fiction.'<br> This subgenre allowed women writers to participate in postbellum culture and to critique other aspects of a rapidly changing society. Domestic detective fiction combined elements of sensationalist papers, popular nonfiction crime stories, and the domestic novel. Nickerson shows how it also incorporated the gothic tropes found in the work of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, and Charlotte BrontÃ« and influenced the work of Pauline Hopkins. Mid-nineteenth-century writer Metta Fuller Victor, who represented such important areas of cultural conflict as the role of professions in the formation of class identity and the possibility of women's independence and self-determination, paved the way for the appearance of women detectives in the late-nineteenth-century fiction of Anna Katharine Green. Nickerson credits Mary Roberts Rinehart, in particular, for bringing sophistication to the subgenre by amplifying the humorous, terrifying, and feminist elements inherent in earlier detective novels by women. Throughout the volume, Nickerson focuses on the narrative qualities of the domestic novel tradition and the ways in which it reflected ideologies of domesticity and gender. Also included are a discussion of various rewritings of the Lizzie Borden scandal in this tradition and an afterword on the relation of domestic detective fiction to the hard-boiled style.<br> <i>The Web of Iniquity</i> places the detective fiction written by women between 1850 and 1940 into ongoing discussions regarding women, culture, and literature and will appeal to scholars and students of women's studies, American studies, and literary history.</p>",en,"1st, Date Same on Title & Copyright Page","Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 5.83 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/19/9780822322719.jpg,Success,83,22.1

The world that resulted, boasting stone quays, great swaths of lawn, three Christian churches, and musical levees, eventually encompassed a territory the size of England, its campaigns paid for in human heads.

Using the Colorado initiative as his focus, Gerstmann untangles the complex standards and subtle rhetoric the Supreme Court uses to apply the equal protection clause. <br><br>The Court divides people into legal classes that receive varying levels of protection; gays and lesbians and other groups, such as the elderly and the poor, receive the least.

Within months Peggy was sending coded messages to an old suitor from England, conveying Arnold’s promise to defect. When their plot was discovered, the general fled. Peggy distracted George Washington with hysterics before following her husband. The British government eventually paid Peggy far more than Benedict Arnold ever received.A generation later, the Philadelphia neighborhood where Margaret Shippen had grown up was home to a businessman named James Forten. Due to his invention for rigging sails, Forten was rich enough to build large public halls and bankroll political causes. At the same time, this veteran of the Revolution was losing his political voice because he was black.Margaret Shippen Arnold and James Forten are just two of the fifteen fascinating but little-known lives told in Forgotten Americans. Weitten by an honored biographer and an award-winning poet, this entertaining book shines a light on overlooked figures. Traditional histories have often neglected these people, for many reasons. Some were on the losing side of a conflict, such as Tecumeseh, who spent years trying to unite Indian nations against white settlers. Others worked behind the scenes, like Annie Turner Wittenmyer, who took charge of supplying Union hospitals in the West during the Civil War. And some we disregard because their actions now seem unsavory, as with the once-celebrated ”Indian-slayer” Tom Quick.From these fascinating threads, Will Randall and Nancy Nahra weave a rich tapestry of American life. In it we witness the power of religious revival and the lure of mass entertainment. We watch philosophical differences split the nation. We see the shift in Native American’s lives from Teedyuscung, a Delaware murdered despite his conversion to Christianity, to Louis Sockalexis, the baseball prodigy. These lively stories also reveal little-known facets of the famous: Benjamin Franklin’s disinherited son, Thomas Jefferson’s secret politicking, and how Mary Todd Lincoln’s confinement to a mental hospital became a public issue.

Maybe they like to be dependent. But I do think it's terribly important that people not make that inner decision. Because then they sit around and they're old. It's easy not to do it, in fact. It's not about staying young but about not getting old.""--Doris Lessing
<p>On Women Turning 70 is a celebration-of success, love, relationships, self-of life. Its sixteen intimate portraits of women in their seventies are a testament to women everywhere that life can and must be lived to its fullest.

0-8223-2317-6,Don't: A Reader's Guide to the Military's Anti-Gay Policy (Public Planet Books),Janet Halley,Duke University Press Books,176,4/9/1999,"Politics & Gay Rights, Homophobia, United States - Military Policy",Paperback,"<p>In <i>Donât</i> Janet E. Halley explains how the military's new anti-gay policy is fundamentally misdescribed by its common nickname, 'Don't Ask/Don't Tell.' This ubiquitous phrase, she points out, implies that it discharges servicemembers not for who they are, but for what they do. It insinuates that, as long as military personnel keep quiet about their homosexual orientation and desist from 'homosexual conduct,' no one will try to pry them out of their closets and all will be well.<br>Not so, reveals Halley. In order to work through the steps by which the new law was ultimately drafted, she opens with a close reading of the 1986 Supreme Court sodomy case which served as the legal and rhetorical model for the policy revisions made in 1993. Halley also describes how the Clinton administrationâs attempts to offer Congress an opportunity to regulate conduct-and not status-were flatly rejected and not included in the final statute. Using cultural and critical theory seldom applied to explain the law, Halley argues that, far from providing privacy and an assurance that servicemembers' careers will be ruined only if they engage in illegal conduct, the rule activates a culture of minute surveillance in which every member must strictly avoid using any gesture in an ever-evolving lexicon of 'conduct that manifests a propensity.' In other words, not only homosexuals but <i>all</i> military personnel are placed in danger by the new policy. After challenging previous pro-gay arguments against the policy that have failed to expose its most devious and dangerous elements, Halley ends with a persuasive discussion about how it is both unconstitutional and, politically, an act of sustained bad faith.<br>This knowledgeable and eye-opening analysis of one of the most important public policy debates of the 1990s will interest legal scholars, policymakers, activists, military historians and personnel, as well as citizens concerned about issues of discrimination.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.03 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches",20.85,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/74/9780822323174.jpg,Success,80,22.1

Taken In By Her Stern But Dutiful Grandparents, Rainey Is Made To Suffer For Her Mothers Sins As Well As For Her Own Bookish Intelligence, Considered Unseemly By The Small Rural Community. As A Child, She Dreams That Her Mother Will Return To Rescue Her From Her Strict, Resentful Grandmother. At 12, She Begs Gods Forgiveness For Wanting More. Later She Transfers Her Longing To Her Glamorous Second Cousin, Ambrose Torsten Dienst, With Whom She Forms A Secret Alliance During One Of His Rare Visits From New York.

Her Grandparents, Scandinavian Immigrants Who Often Invoke The Old Country, Seem Stereotypical At First, But Are Gradually Revealed As Multifaceted; They, Too, Have Suffered Dreadful Losses, Which They Are Too Stoical To Acknowledge.

Raineys Life Is No Holiday, But She Grows To Embrace It With Gratitude; In The End, Her Lament Becomes A Song Of Cautious Affirmation.
