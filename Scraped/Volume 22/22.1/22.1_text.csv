“It’s time to get angry again.”
30 years after The Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer
gives us the book she vowed she’d never write,
The Whole Woman.
Here’s what Greer’s saying —
On sex: “Sex at the end of the century is no longer a matter of
intercourse. The sex of the millennium is pornography. Pornography is
the sexuality of the information revolution, elaborated to achieve all the
staggering impact of which the megamedia are capable... After thirty
years of feminist struggle, there is vastly more pornography disseminated more widely than ever before.
On pop culture:
“Our culture is far more masculinist than it was thirty years ago. Computer use is spreading into every
home but more than 80% of Internet users are male. Women are ignored by manufacturers of video
games, which are mostly war games of one sort or another. Popular music is split as never before: the
consumers of commercial pop are female; the rock music that appeals to men is deliberately,
unbelievably and outrageously misogynist. While women were struggling to live as responsible
dignified adults, men have retreated into extravagantly masculinist fantasies and behaviors.”
On globalisation:
“The most powerful entities on earth are not governments but the multinational corporations that
see women as their territory, indoctrinating them with their versions of
beauty, health and hygiene, medicating them and cultivating their
dependency in order to medicate them some more. S- RMAINE
GREER
On the future:
“The second wave of feminism, rather than having crashed on the shore, is
still far out to sea, slowly and inexorably gathering momentum.... Female
power will rush upon us in the persons of women who have nothing to lose,
having lost everything already... And the women of the rich world had
better hope that when female energy ignites they do not find themselves on
the wrong side.” O A

reminder from Feminist Memoir Project is that

turned out to be a lot more complicated than that.

reading last fall of Beyond the Limbo Silence, Eliza-

attending college on a scholarship in rural Wiscon-
sin and the ways she’s caught up in the Civil Rights
and Black Power movements — and dropped with a
thud when that woman's issue, conception, rears its
complicated head. It’s profound on the ways women
do and don’t manage to support each other and the
places where passionate idealism goes head to head
with an entrenched social system that isn’t about to
yeild power or profit in the name of justice or
humanity. ($12.95 pb, 1-58005-013-1, Seal Press. Dis-
tributed by PGW) And that, pretty much, seems to be
the theme of my reading for the last six months (see
Power, and yes, even Coachella and Cowboys, above).

UNSTRUNG HEART by Robbi Sommers
Only an author with the artistry of Robbi Sommers could paint such a
multilayered portrait of a woman's life.
With her brilliant palette of poetry and prose, Robbi captures the delicate play
of colors and light that illuminate our deepest hopes and fears. In intimate
brushstrokes, she highlights and shades the real-life experiences that tear us
apart . . . and make us whole.
— From the darkest grief . . . to the brightest joy . ..….
— From the soft pastels of new-found love ..….to the damp watercolors of
desire ....
— From the blood-red hues of heartache . .…. to the crystal blues of healing . .
: A richly emotional portrait of love, loss and transformation, this unique work
has much to teach us about Robbi, about each other, about ourselves.

CHANGE OF HEART
by Linda Hill
British supermodel Julia Westgate has
always limited her encounters with women to secret trysts and one- or two-
night stands.
While on a shoot in Boston, Julia carefully disguises herself, then sneaks
out to a secluded lesbian bar. There she meets local journalist Cory Hayes.
After spending a passionate weekend with Julia, Cory is devastated when
she wakes up to an empty bed.
Cory’s jaw drops when she sees an exquisite face on the cover of a
fashion magazine that looks more than vaguely familiar. Thus begins a game
of hide-and-seek, with Julia trying to run
from herself and her uncertain future —
and Cory willing to risk everything to find
her.

get into the dating scene. At times, she thought, the only things that kept her
going were her dog, her love of the outdoors, and her long-term relationship

But just when she least expects it, not one, but two exciting new women walk

Diana, Princess of Wales: How Sexual Politics
Shook the Monarchy by Beatrix Campbell analyzes
the life and death of Princess Diana through a femi-
nist lens. From the blurb: “Diana’s only qualifications
for her arranged marriage were her body, her face,
her fertility, and her virginity, and the world assumed
public ownership of her as it followed and assessed
her every move; never before had a young woman
been subject to such scrutiny.” Campbell reveals
Diana's simultaneous powerlessness and power as a
princess, and details how Diana used her limited
power to champion the cause of AIDS sufferers,
battered women and children, women with eating
disorders, and people injured by land mines. Camp-
bell also explores Diana's disruption of the power
structure of the royal family and the role of the media
in Diana’s death. From the blurb: “Diana
died...hounded by a posse of men who refused her the
right to say yes when she meant yes and no when she
meant no. But Diana was mourned by millions of
women; women who identified with Diana’s life and
who, consciously or subconsciously, understood the
messages of her death.” I think that Campbell's take
on the worldwide media's moralizing about the A best-selling astrological moon calendar and more...

Pool-Hopping and Other Stories by Anne Fleming
$13.95 paper, 1-896095-18-6, Available POLESTAR BOOK PUBLISHERS
Anne Fleming is nominated for the second annual DANUTA GLEED LITERARY AWARD for this first
collection of stories. The Danuta Gleed Award honours the best first collection of short stories by
a Canadian author and has a $5000 first prize. It is administered by the Writers’ Union of Canada.
The winner will be announced on Canada Book Day, April 23, 1999.
With humour and insight, Fleming creates a fascinating, diverse cast of characters—women
and men, old, middle-aged and young, many of them queer, lesbian or gay. In a review of
Pool-Hopping, The Georgia Straight writes, “Her evenhanded, sharp-eyed and often hilarious
narratives traverse the frenzied chaos of urban life with ease and precision.”
NaN ře 1A And Publishers Weekly writes, “At once ruthlessly precise with her descriptions (“Winters
now were petulant and bitter, like the brothers of kings”) and generous to her characters, she
makes a bracing, truthful debut with these 13 stories.”

Anne Tyler said that Nina Berberova’s (The Ladies

is “as graceful and subtle as Chekhov.” This semi-

lives a dreary life tied down by a demanding and
invalid husband. However, when a childhood friend
commits suicide, she is called to the scene. As she
mourns his death, she reflects upon her life in Russia,
and the disappointing path that it has taken since.
Berberova is an important rediscovery, and her writ-
ing is, as the copy says, both poignant and
unsentimental. $23.95 cl, 0-8112-1401-X.
