That the minor happened to be Johnson's unborn child made her case all the more complex, controversial, and ultimately, historical. Stephen R. Kandall, a neonatologist and pediatrician, testified as an expert witness on Johnson's behalf. The experience caused him to wonder how one disadvantaged black woman's case became a prosecutorial battlefield in the war on drugs. This book is the product of Kandall's search through the annals of medicine and history to learn how women have fared in this conflict and how drug-dependent women have been treated for the past century and a half.</p><p>Kandall's sleuthing uncovers an intriguing and troubling story. Opium, laudanum, and morphine were primary ingredients in the curative powders and strengthening tonics that physicians freely prescribed and pharmacists dispensed to women a hundred and fifty years ago. Or a woman could easily dose herself with narcotics and alcohol in the readily available form of patent medicines sold in every town and touted in popular magazines (Over a million bottles sold and in every one a cure!). For the most part unaware of their dangers, women turned to these remedies for female complaints, such as womb disease and congestion of the ovaries, as well as for neurasthenia, a widespread but vague nervous malady attributed to women's weaker, more sensitive natures. Not surprisingly, by the latter half of the nineteenth century the majority of America's opiate addicts were women.</p><p>The more things change, the more they remain the same: <i>Substance and Shadow</i> shows how, though attitudes and drugs may vary over time-from the laudanum of yesteryear to the heroin of the thirties and forties, the tranquilizers of the fifties, the consciousness-raising or prescription drugs of the sixties, and the ascendance of crack use in the eighties-dependency remains an issue for women. Kandall traces the history of questionable treatment that has followed this trend. From the maintenance clinics of the early twenties to the federal farms of mid-century to the detoxification efforts and methadone maintenance that flourished in the wake of the Women's Movement, attempts to treat drug-dependent women have been far from adequate. As he describes current policies that put money into drug interdiction and prisons, but offer little in the way of treatment or hope for women like Jennifer Johnson, Kandall calls our attention to the social and personal costs of demonizing and punishing women addicts rather than trying to improve their circumstances and give them genuine help.</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches",16.27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/14/9780674853614.jpg,Success,100.0,22.2

Their topic, broadly defined, was the postmodern American West. By the mid-1980s, their combined works made for a bona fide literary groundswell in both critical and commercial terms. However, as Krista Comer notes, despite the attentions of publishers, the media, and millions of readers, literary scholars have rarely addressed this movement or its writers.</p>
<p>Too many critics, Comer argues, still enamored of western images that are both masculine and antimodern, have been slow to reckon with the emergence of a new, far more ""feminine,"" postmodern, multiracial, and urban west. Here, she calls for a redesign of the field of western cultural studies, one that engages issues of gender and race and is more self-conscious about space itself—especially that cherished symbol of western ""authenticity,"" open landscape. Surveying works by Joan Didion, Wanda Coleman, Maxine Hong Kingston, Leslie Marmon Silko, Barbara Kingsolver, Pam Houston, Louise Erdrich, Sandra Cisneros, and Mary Clearman Blew, Comer shows how these and other contemporary women writers have mapped new geographical imaginations upon the cultural and social spaces of today's American West.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.05380961236 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches",5.15,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/35/9780807848135.jpg,Success,107.0,22.2

0-312-20559-7,The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,"Dally, Peter",St Martins Pr,225.0,1999-12,,Hardcover,"In this haunting and compelling book, eminent psychiatrist Peter Dally explores the darker side of Virginia Woolf. Bringing together his knowledge as a doctor with his life-long fascination with Woolf's life and work, he sheds light on the depression that tormented her adult years.
<p>A quiet life cushioned Virginia from the bouts of depression and elation that she regularly experienced, but life in the public eye profoundly affected her moods and her behavior. On three occasions Virginia went mad. This terrified her, and she lived in constant fear of the return of this dreadful affliction. Yet the experience gave her the extraordinary insight and new ideas and associations that were to emerge in her writing.</p>
<p>Ideally, every manic depressive needs to be protected from stress. Virginia had several protectors, but none so vital as her husband, Leonard. Without his constant vigilance and care, it is doubtful she would have been so creatively productive. Yet, paradoxically, their marriage precipitated one of her bouts of madness. At the end of her life, when events outside the couple's control led to Leonard's gradual withdrawal and his own depression, Virginia found herself facing her madness alone, and with tragic results.</p>
<p> Compassionate and disturbing, this fascinating study is the first to look at Virginia Woolf's life from the perspective of her madness. Although a general psychiatrist, his professional outlook is eclectic and he has particular interests in manic depression and anorexia nervosa, a subject on which he has written several books. Virginia Woolf first aroused his interest when, as a student, he read <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>. He subsequently became absorbed in her diaries,which give a wider and deeper picture of manic depression than any textbook could. This book then is about her life, and her marriage, in relation to manic depression, and the author is as much Virginia Woolf's psychiatrist as her biographer."" - Peter Dally</p>",en,1st U.S. Ed,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/91/9780312205591.jpg,Success,123.0,22.2

In spite of their past and continued pain and suffering, they are able to make sense of their adversity and work to move beyond it, to focus on having a meaningful life filled with love, growth, and connection to community. But why do these women triumph over their painful experiences and memories when, understandably, so many others do not? With the Phoenix Rising tells the stories of ten women who have successfully integrated the experience of traumatic childhood sexual abuse into their lives. Their lessons provide hope for fellow survivors and give clinicians the insight they need to help encourage such resiliency in women with similar devastating histories.</p>
<p>The authors, led by Boston University professor Frances Grossman, interviewed and studied ten women over the course of several years to learn what contributed to their resiliency. Their stories-their own sense of what helped them to lead successful lives-have been integrated into a framework essential for mental health professionals who assess and treat women with severe trauma histories. This framework will guide clinicians as they help their clients shift their sense of themselves from damaged to resilient. Clinicians will gain insight into the resilient strategies-setting boundaries, utilizing coping techniques, and looking out for the mind and body-used by these women and how these traits can be developed in their clients.</p>
<p>With the Phoenix Rising focuses beyond the pathology that dominates the literature on the subject, enabling behavioral health care practitioners to broaden their perspective regarding survivors to one of strengths, not just pain and injury, and to integrate these factors and processes into working successfully with those who have suffered child abuse.</p>
<p>The Resilience of the Human Spirit</p>
<p>Why do some women overcome traumatic childhood experiences while others, understandably, suffer terrible psychological consequences?</p>
<p>The devastating effects of childhood sexual abuse have been widely chronicled, validating the difficulty with which many survivors struggle. Often overlooked are the millions of women who have overcome early trauma to lead successful, happy lives. Why do these women-whom we might otherwise have expected to fail-have such tremendous strength and resilience? This question is at the heart of With the Phoenix Rising as it paints a moving and optimistic portrait of ten women who have overcome the trauma of childhood sexual abuse and shows how their resilient success can be encouraged in others who have suffered similar traumas.</p>
<p>""Through its emphasis on survivors' strengths and resilience over the life course, this book brings a new focus to the study of child sexual abuse. Therapists, researchers, and survivors will gain an important understanding of resiliency in the context of family, community, and women's lives. The authors give voice to women who have overcome the trauma of abuse."" -Linda M. Williams, director of research, the Stone Center, Wellesley College</p>
<p>""This important book breaks new ground.... For any reader wishing to be inspired by stories of the human spirit's triumph over adversity."" -Daniel Brown, Harvard Medical School, Simmons School of Social Work</p>
<p>""The women's voices of With the Phoenix Rising bring to life the spirit and hope every survivor can discover. This wonderful book has something to offer new clinicians as well as seasoned trauma professionals."" -Linda T. Sanford, author of Strong at the Broken Places</p>
<p>""Full of practical wisdom and perspective for trauma clinicians working with all trauma survivor groups. Survivors will find their strengths and dignity cherished without the slightest aid-and-comfort to given perpetrators and their apologists.

""Murray perfectly captures the patois and fury of the Mexican women of the East L.A. neighborhood Echo Park."" -- Publishers Weekly<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Rather than simmer beneath the surface, anger boils over on the pages of this first novel. Murray perfectly captures the patois and fury of the Mexican women of the East L.A. neighborhood of Echo Park. Here, the gang hierarchy is set in stone. There are jefes, right hands, taggers, third raters and sheep, the last being the girls who shut up, pose prettily at rumblas and carry babies for the men. Narrators Luca and Cecelia, however, do not fit this role: Luca wants to be a grandola; Cecelia sees herself as ugly, a ""dirt dark Indian"" who can't hold on to a pregnancy or a girlfriend. At the outset, the gun-dealing Lobos gang prevails, led by Manny, who is Cecelia's brother and Luca's lover. As cocaine supersedes guns and upstart rival G-4s challenge the Lobos, the two women struggle, exhibiting a depth of character that sets them apart from other women in Echo Park. In portraying Luca's unrelenting criminal meanness and hunger for power and Cecelia's ultimate resignation to a life of praying and cleaning rich rubias' houses, Murray gives readers inner-city gang life from the eyes of women. Both narrators' voices are insistent, unvarnished, in-your-face tough. The reader equipped with a Spanish-English dictionary has the best chance to grasp all the nuances of this convincing, under-the-skin work.

In its aftermath, Angela Davis, an African American activist-scholar who had campaigned vigorously for prisoners' rights, was placed on the FBI's ""ten most wanted list."" Captured in New York City two months later, she was charged with murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy. Her trial, chronicled in this ""compelling tale"" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>), brought strong public indictment. <em>The Morning Breaks</em> is a riveting firsthand account of Davis's ordeal and her ultimate triumph, written by an activist in the student, civil rights, and antiwar movements who was intimately involved in the struggle for her release.</p>

Martha Raye sang, danced, and joked her way into the spotlight of the entertainment world with a career that spanned seven decades and encompassed everything from vaudeville to television commercials to entertaining U.S. troops. Take It from the Big Mouth, the first full-fledged biography of the multi-talented performer, explores Raye's life and career with candor and insight. Raye got her big break when she caught the attention of a film director as she kidded with audience members Joe E. Lewis and Jimmy Durante during an engagement at the Trocadero in Hollywood. In the late 1930s, Raye appeared in a number of films, and the press heralded her as a ""stridently funny comedienne with a Mammoth Cave mouth."" From there her career soared. She landed a role in Charlie Chaplain's film Monsieur Verdoux, and the New York Post commented that Raye was the only one who could hold her own with the comic master. By the 1950s she hosted her own highly rated television show, reaching millions with her clowning. Behind the huge smile and raucous laugh, though, there was a darker side to Martha Raye. She found solace from her insecurities and a frenzied schedule in the use of drugs and alcohol. Her seven rocky marriages, the last to a man 33 years her junior whom she had known less than two weeks, fueled headlines and gossip columns. Particularly painful was her turbulent relationship with her only daughter, Melodye. She was passionately committed to entertaining troops abroad during World War II, and she worked tirelessly as both entertainer and nurse in the remote jungles of Vietnam. Bob Hope commented that ""she was Florence Nightingale, Dear Abby, and the only singer who could be heard over the artillery fire."" The Green Berets designated her an honorary lieutenant colonel, and she later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. After her death in 1994, ""Colonel Maggie"" became the only civilian laid to rest among the Green Berets at the Fort Bragg military cemetery.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.16 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",2.46,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/09/9780813121109.jpg,Success,106.0,22.2

The book embraces historical chapters, contemporary political analyses, and cultural studies (focusing on literature and religion).</p><p>Socialist Yugoslavia undertook a relatively unusual experiment during the forty-six years of its existence (1945â91)-to eliminate the sources of social, economic, and gender inequality while laying the foundation for a society in which women and men could enjoy complete equality in politics, in education and careers, and in family life. Although the aspiration was shared with other communist countries, Yugoslavia gave its experiment a unique twist by linking its program with institutional changes to be realized through self-management organs and a complicated delegate system. The socialist system represented an improvement where gender equality was concerned over the pre-existing system associated with the interwar Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but it did not fulfill its promises.</p><p>Recognizing the need for a book that surveys the experience of South Slav women during the twentieth century, Sabrina Ramet commissioned essays from leading scholars in East European/Yugoslav studies and womenâs studies for this volume. The resulting collection is arranged in rough chronological order, covering primarily Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia from before World War II until present day. Topics covered include the structures of traditional society, gender relations in the interwar period, anti-Fascist organizations, the socialist experience, and issues connected to post-socialist politics and the war, making this the most comprehensive and up-to-date book on the subject.</p><p>Contributors are Andrei SimiÄ, Thomas A.

Living most of her adult life in a spiritual community with author and meditation teacher Eknath Easwaran, Flinders has contemplated the works of women mystics including Julian of Norwich, Teresa of Avila and Clare of Assisi. But how can these women's (and her own) experiences of peace and God jibe with the often angry feminist Flinders finds herself to be? In historical context, she examines today's sexism and violence against womenthe legacy of patriarchy that, she says, is not a natural condition at alland uncovers parallels between Gandhi's Indian revolution against British colonialism and the challenges facing Western women today. Flinders concludes that reclaiming the ancient sacred feminine is not at odds with political feminism, but rather necessary for it.

Many of the narratives&#8212;such as those of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs&#8212;have achieved reputations as masterpieces; but some of the lesser-known narratives are equally brilliant. This unprecedented anthology presents them unabridged, providing each one with helpful introductions and annotations, to form the most comprehensive volume ever assembled on the lives and writings of the slaves. Volume Two (1849&#8211;1866) includes the narratives of Henry Bibb, James W. C. Pennington, Solomon Northup, John Brown, John Thompson, William and Ellen Craft, Harriet Jacobs (Linda Brent), Jacob D. Green, James Mars, and William Parker.<BR></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>With this compact set, editor Taylor, director of Lawrence Hill's ""Library of Black America"" series, offers an invaluable anthology of the dominant genre of early African American literature--the ex-slave autobiography. Taking as a title the five-word opening frequent in the genre, Taylor presents 20 unabridged first editions, supplying typographical corrections and annotations to persons, places, and terms. He introduces each selection with a brief head note providing an interpretive context as well as details on the author's life and the publication's history. His selections capture nine of the ten most referenced ex-slave narratives in U.S. history and offer two previously un-reprinted works. Scholars may contrast Taylor's introduction to the volumes with the more literary overview in Henry Louis Gates Jr. and William L. Andrews's Pioneers of the Black Atlantic: Five Slave Narratives from the Enlightenment, 1772-1815 (LJ 12/98). But nothing detracts from Taylor's care and skill in presenting this sampling of authentic American voices. No serious collection on U.S. history or literature, and certainly no collection on African Americans, can be without these two volumes. Highly recommended.--Thomas J.

And yet she has remained an enigmatic figure. Among other questions that this study considers is why has this writer, so central to the creative boom of Latin American literature, been relatively understudied by contemporary critics? More specifically, why has this great woman writer been almost completely left out of feminist discourse regarding Latin American literature? In order to address these questions and to better understand Ocampo's work, the analysis sustains an extended dialogue between her short fiction and current Euro-American feminist theory.

For Rosezella Maynette Fisher, outspoken sister girl and controversial Dean of Students at Harvard Law School, it was murder. And the debonair new President of Harvard is a prime suspect. A Darker Shade of Crimson is a novel about how Ella Fisher ended up dead on the first day of the fall semester, and how her friend Veronica (Nikki) Chase - a smart, ambitious, attractive, and well-connected black economics professor - sets out to solve the crime, and in the process uncovers some of Harvard's most deeply buried secrets. At twenty-eight, Nikki is a rising star, the only black professor in Harvard's economics department. After stumbling over Ella Fisher's body during a blackout in a classroom building, she is quickly plunged into the investigation of her death. With the occasional tip from Raphael Griffin, a Harvard policeman, Nikki learns that plenty of people could have wanted Ella dead. Only two people seem to mourn Ella's passing: her blue-blooded, Wellesley-educated secretary, Lindsey Wentworth; and Ella's best girlfriend, Alix Coulter, an actress from Texas with attitude. With their help, Nikki sets out to unravel simultaneously the mystery of Ella's death and the complications of her own love life. Dante Rosario, her long-lost ex-boyfriend, turns up and sets off a chemical reaction; meanwhile, Justin Simms, a Harvard Law School student who flirts like a master, won't take no for an answer. It takes the combined wisdom of Nikki's landlady, Magnolia Dailey, and her best friend, Jessica Leiberman, to help her understand her own heart as she drives toward the shocking conclusion that will turn all of Harvard on its ear.",en,First Edition,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",6.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/08/9780671016708.jpg,Success,25.0,22.2

They also explore writing as a visual vehicle, both as a pattern across a field and as a catalyst for imagery. Looking at the paintings themselves involves examining the way that they make meaning and, in contrast, the way that words make meaning of them and of themselves - what happens when you have a representation of a representation? All the poems in this collection weave in and out of proximity to visual work, sometimes from the distance of a gallery viewer, sometimes as a character in the painting itself. Issues of narrative sequence and time float through the collection but are always subordinate to the play and rule of language on the page.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The world fleshed forth in oil paint, from Giotto to Joseph Albers, is meticulously essayed in the mixed-genre ekphraseis of Swensen's sixth full-length collection since 1984. Though the medieval and early Renaissance tableaux she focuses on are almost entirely composed in the restricted vocabulary of Christian iconography, Swensen regards them with a worldly eye, using her role as translator of the works--from religious past to secular present, from image to text--to explore an ethics of human immanence. Addressing herself to one in a countless string of mid-millenium representations of the Flight into Egypt, for instance, Swensen finds that the holy family enters not a heavenly but a very worldly world, a world just like ours except that it's not and that it can't be reached. As with the gulf between the visual and the verbal dimensions, what the mind posits as an inviolable border (it can't be reached), the body is ever violating--translating, trying--in practice. In a literally unguarded moment, the intangible yields to an insatiably human craving for contact: She touched the painting/ as soon as the guard// turned his back. This illicit gesture discloses the very essence of Swensen's project, her daring try at a communion of flesh and canvas, word and image, art and life.

McKinley called her ""the woman."" Ruth Anne Kocour, a world-class mountaineer, wasn't bothered. It was part of the challenge she faced as she joined an all-male team to conquer North America's highest peak...the mountain the Indians called Denali, or God.</p>
<p>Faced the extreme. But nine days into this ascent, a forty-fifth birthday present to herself, the most violent weather on record slammed into the mountain. Ruth Anne and her group would be trapped on an ice shelf at 14,000 feet for the deadliest two weeks in Denali history. Pinned down by blinding snows, unable to help other teams dying around her, and her own feet freezing solid, Ruth Anne tells of a wind chill of minus 150 degrees, deadly hidden crevasses, and being trapped in a place so violent and unforgiving that it threatened to push her over the edge and into a place of no return. And yet, in prose as crystalline as the ice around her, she tells, too, of beauty, courage, and the spirit that drives true mountainers higher, as she risks all to go for the summit...and perhaps, for a transcendant moment, touch heaven.</p>

Following on the heels of this vibrant and growing body of work, New Latina Narrative offers the first in-depth synthesis and literary analysis of this transethnic genre. Focusing on the dynamic writing published in the 1980s and 1990s by Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, and Domincan American women, New Latina Narrative illustrates how these writers have redefined the concepts of multiculturalism and diversity in American society. As participants in both mainstream and grassroots forms of multiculturalism, these new Latina narrativists have created a feminine space within postmodern ethnicity, disrupting the idealistic veneer of diversity with which publishers often market this fiction. In this groundbreaking study, author Ellen McCracken opens the conventional boundaries of Latino/a literary criticism, incorporating elements of cultural studies theory and contemporary feminism. Emphasizing the diversity within new Latina narrative, McCracken discusses the works of more than two dozen writers, including Julia Alvarez, Denise Ch&aacute;vez, Sandra Cisneros, Cristina Garcia, Graciela Lim&oacute;n, Demetria Mart&iacute;nez, Pat Mora, Cherr&iacute;e Moraga, Mary Helen Ponce, and Helena Mar&iacute;a Viramontes. She stresses such themes as the resignification of master narrative, the autobiographical self and collective identity, popular religiosity, subculture and transgression, and narrative harmony and dissonance. New Latina Narrative provides readers an enriched basis forreconceiving the overall Latino/a literary field and its relation to other contemporary literary and cultural trends. McCracken's original approach extends the Latina literary canon&#151;both the works to be studied and the issues to be examined&#151;resulting in a valuable work for all readers of women's studies, contemporary American literature, ethnic studies, communications, and sociology.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 0.84 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",10.97,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/15/9780816519415.jpg,Success,105.0,22.2

Intensely moving and untimately hopeful, the story evolved from the author's exploration into the mysterious impact of family history on her own psychology. Moats' distinctive literary style is as much poetry as prose.

In Where Is Ana Mendieta? art historian Jane Blocker provides an in-depth critical analysis of Mendieta's diverse body of work. Although her untimely death in 1985 remains shrouded in controversy, her life and artistic legacy provide a unique vantage point from which to consider the history of performance art, installation, and earth works, as well as feminism, multiculturalism, and postmodernism.
<p>Taken from banners carried in a 1992 protest outside the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the title phrase ""Where is Ana Mendieta?"" evokes not only the suspicious and tragic circumstances surrounding her death but also the conspicuous absence of women artists from high-profile exhibitions. Drawing on the work of such theorists as Judith Butler, Joseph Roach, Edward Said, and Homi Bhabha, Blocker discusses the power of Mendieta's earth-and-body art to alter, unsettle, and broaden the terms of identity itself. She shows how Mendieta used exile as a discursive position from which to disrupt dominant categories, analyzing as well Mendieta's use of mythology and anthropology, the ephemeral nature of her media, and the debates over her ethnic, gender, and national identities.</p>
<p>As the first major critical examination of this enigmatic artist's work, Where Is Ana Mendieta? will interest a broad audience, particularly those involved with the production, criticism, theory, and history of contemporary art.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.46 Inches",18.92,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/42/9780822323242.jpg,Success,100.0,22.2

Now, a child raised in captivity among the angels will journey the length and breadth of her world to seek the documents that will alter the face of Samaria forever...<br><br>&quot;A warm and triumphant close to Shinn&#39;s Samaria trilogy.&quot;--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&quot;The most promising and original writer of fantasy to come along since Robin McKinley.&quot;--Peter S.

Archangel Bael has no patience for the Jacobites, a band of renegades who believe that Jovah is a spaceship programmed to respond to the petitions of the angels. According to legend, the Alleluia Files possess the proof the Jacobites need to defend themselves, but they have no idea where or even what the files are. When an angel named Jared crosses paths with Tamar, a Jacobite, the two fall in love. Jared helps Tamar's group search for the files, knowing the risks and dangers associated with betraying his own beliefs. When the first two books are as good as Archangel (Ace, 1996) and Jovah's Angel (Ace, 1997), the third in a series has a tough act to follow. Fortunately, The Alleluia Files is every bit as intriguing and satisfying as its predecessors. Shinn poses some difficult questions about religion and faith that are not easily answered in their world-or ours. The plot may not be as compelling as the first two titles, but the romance is strong and the tension builds with a momentum to rival any soap opera. This title is a must for any library owning the first two and an excuse to get the others if you have not already done so.

This celebration of Mexican ceramics combines a gallery of more than one hundred stunning photographs with an insightful text that illuminates the artistry and the artists&#151;all of whom are women. The fanciful, brightly colored works spring from the rich imaginations of rural women drawing on enduring religion, mythology, and themes from their everyday lives. <i>Oaxacan Ceramics</i> tells the remarkable story of six of the most renowned artisans who live and work in villages near the city of Oaxaca. Their exuberant, whimsical creations range from the fantastic to the religious, including mermaids, angels, Zapotec creatures, figures of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, vases, candle holders, and decorative plates&#151;all finely crafted and distinctly colored. <i>Oaxacan Ceramics</i> paints an extraordinary portrait of a vibrant culture and its art.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Oaxaca is one of the poorest states in Mexico, and nearly half a million of its three million inhabitants have turned to the craft traditions of their ancestors to sustain themselves. Among the many popular art forms, the folk art of ceramics is the most widespread. Colorful and insightful, this book profiles the top artists working in this popular craft today and celebrates the new direction taken in pottery--the transition from utilitarian to whimsical and decorative. While some pieces remain utilitarian, others sport colorful fish or angel faces protruding in bas-relief. Bright, cheerful colors cover nativity figurines, animals and mermaids from folklore, skeletons in dress-up, and Frida Kahlo lookalikes. Wasserspring (Latin American studies, Wellesley Coll.) discusses the lives of the mostly women potters as well as their techniques and artistic tradition. The quality of the photographs and paper is outstanding, as is the price for such a well-produced art book. Although there are many larger books on Mexican art, as a single source on Oaxacan ceremics, this book is unique.

Yet one significant and substantial portion of her accomplishment has remained largely overlooked: Wharton's numerous exercises in literary criticism. Constituting an unusually little-known body of work by an otherwise preeminent American writer, Wharton's many scattered reviews and essays, literary eulogies, and forewords and introductions (to her own work, and to works of others) have never before been collected in a single volume. Covering works of various literary traditions, including eloquent general considerations of fiction and criticism, and embracing novels, volumes of lyric and dramatic verse, and works by other critics of literature, art, and architecture, these critical writings uniquely demonstrate the extraordinary range of Wharton's critical interests and intelligence.<p>A searching and comprehensive introductory essay places her critical prose in the context of Wharton's career as a whole, and draws on a wealth of unpublished materials in exploring the uncertainties and inhibitions against which she had to struggle in order to express herself as a critic at all. Assembling her miscellaneous critical writings (including some newly discovered texts), this authoritative edition makes an exceptional contribution not only to the ongoing Wharton revival but to the study of American literature, of literary criticism, and of women as writers of criticism.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.06262810284 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/99/9780691002699.jpg,Success,102.0,22.2

Although the Greek archaic lyrics attributed to Sappho of Lesbos survive only in fragments, she has been invoked for many centuries as the original woman poet, singing at the origins of a Western lyric tradition. <i>Victorian Sappho</i> traces the emergence of this idealized feminine figure through reconstructions of the Sapphic fragments in late-nineteenth-century England. Yopie Prins argues that the Victorian period is a critical turning point in the history of Sappho's reception; what we now call ""Sappho"" is in many ways an artifact of Victorian poetics.</p>
<p>Prins reads the Sapphic fragments in Greek alongside various English translations and imitations, considering a wide range of Victorian poets—male and female, famous and forgotten—who signed their poetry in the name of Sappho. By ""declining"" the name in each chapter, the book presents a theoretical argument about the Sapphic signature, as well as a historical account of its implications in Victorian England. Prins explores the relations between classical philology and Victorian poetics, the tropes of lesbian writing, the aesthetics of meter, and nineteenth-century personifications of the ""Poetess."" as current scholarship on Sappho and her afterlife. Offering a history and theory of lyric as a gendered literary form, the book is an exciting and original contribution to Victorian studies, classical studies, comparative literature, and women's studies.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.87523518014 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches",37.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/98/9780691059198.jpg,Success,102.0,22.2

<p>Welcome to a world set to the ever-changing rhythms of an artist's life.</p>
<p>Since childhood, Jewel has turned to her own short stories, vivid narratives, and starkly honest writings to revisit the past, chronicle the many characters she's encountered, and trace the intricate, unpredictable patterns of her days. In <b>Chasing Down the Dawn,</b> recording artist, actress, and bestselling author Jewel opens her intimate journals to create a vivid montage of the people, places, relationships, and passages that colored the life she came from and marked the last magical, turbulent, and ultimately transformational year.</p>
<p>Drawn from her remarkable chronicle of life on the road during the Spirit World Tour, this unforgettable collection of freeze-frames captures unusual images from Jewel's childhood in Alaska, her beginnings as a struggling artist, and her challenges as a daughter, sister, and woman. Jewel paints an unblinkingly honest picture of the exceptional journey that carried her to the world's stage.</p>
<p>Here, as if pulled from a stack of snapshots, are Jewel's moment-by-moment observations on life as she now lives it: the pleasure of sold-out performances and the pressures of her industry .. the sweetness of love and bitterness of loss ... friendship, freedom, and the small miracles we ourselves create. And herein a book that allows the reader a rare glimpse of life's turning points as if viewed from over the author's shoulder — are Jewel's deeply personal insights on the events that shaped her understanding: her parents' divorce, her experience of poverty, the healing of her difficult relationship with her father, and the development of her unique talent.</p>
<p>With the publication of her bestselling collection of poetry, <b>A Night Without Armor,</b> Jewel established herself as a light on the literary horizon. With acutely observed, elegantly written depictions of the musicians, lovers, bikers, strangers, celebrities, and characters that inhabit the singer/songwriter's world, illustrated with Jewel's own drawings and never-before-seen photographs from her family archives, <b>Chasing Down the Dawn</b> is more than a collection of vignettes, observations, and stories.
