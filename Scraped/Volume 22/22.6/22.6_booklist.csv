She has a friend whose morning prayer each day is ""Whatever,"" and whose evening prayer is ""Oh, well."" Anne thinks of Jesus as ""Casper the friendly savior"" and describes God as ""one crafty mother.""</p>
<p>Despite—or because of—her irreverence, faith is a natural subject for Anne Lamott. Since <b>Operating Instructions</b> and <b>Bird by Bird</b>, her fans have been waiting for her to write the book that explained how she came to the big-hearted, grateful, generous faith that she so often alluded to in her two earlier nonfiction books. The people in Anne Lamott's real life are like beloved characters in a favorite series for her readers—her friend Pammy, her son, Sam, and the many funny and wise folks who attend her church are all familiar. And <b>Traveling Mercies</b> is a welcome return to those lives, as well as an introduction to new companions Lamott treats with the same candor, insight, and tenderness.</p>
<p>Lamott's faith isn't about easy answers, which is part of what endears her to believers as well as nonbelievers. Against all odds, she came to believe in God and then, even more miraculously, in herself. As she puts it, ""My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers."" At once tough, personal, affectionate, wise, and very funny, <b>Traveling Mercies</b> tells in exuberant detail how Anne Lamott learned to shine the light of faith on the darkest part of ordinary life, exposing surprising pockets of meaning and hope.</p>",en,"1st Anchor Books Ed, February 2000","Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.48 pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",16,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/94/9780385496094.jpg,Success,130,22.6

Yet the role radical feminism played within the women's movement remains hotly contested. For some, radical feminism has made a lasting contribution to our understanding Sing of male privilege, and the ways the power imbalance between men and women affects the everyday fabric of women's lives. For others, radical feminism represents a reflexive hostility toward men, sex, and heterosexuality, and thus is best ignored or forgotten.
<p>Rather than have the movement be interpreted by others, Radical Feminism permits the original work of radical feminists to speak for itself. Containing pivotal documents written by U.S. radical feminists in the 1960s and 1970s, Radical Feminism includes unpublished and previously published manifestos, position papers, minutes of meetings, and newsletters. Consisting of documents that are nearly impossible to find, or are in danger of being lost altogether, this panoramic collection is organized around the key issues of sex and sexuality, race, children, lesbianism, separatism, and class. Barbara A. Crow rescues the groundbreaking original work of such groups as The Furies, Red-stockings, Cell 16, and the Women's Liberation Movement. Contributors include Kate Millet, Susan Brownmiller, Shulamith Firestone, Rosalyn Baxandall, Toni Morrison, Ellen Willis, Anne Koedt, and Vivian Gornick.</p>

0-8166-3312-6,Screen Style: Fashion and Femininity in 1930s Hollywood,"Berry, Sarah",Univ Of Minnesota Press,256,2/4/2000,,Hardcover,"A vividly illustrated social history of 1930s film and fashion.<br>
<br>
Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich-all were icons of beauty and glamour in 1930s Hollywood. Screen Style reveals the impact of celebrities like these on women filmgoers, looking beyond the surface of the films and fashions of the era-often described as forms of escapism from the difficult realities of the Depression-to show how Hollywood presented women with models for self-determination during a time of rapid social change. <br>
<br>
Revealing the fascination of Hollywood movies in the thirties with strong-willed women-from the ambitions of gold-diggers, working girls, and social climbers to the illicit appeal of female androgyny and ethnic exoticism-Sarah Berry presents a lively, accessible, and lavishly illustrated look at films, fan magazines, and advertising. She views Hollywood glamour in the context of popular debates about fashion, identity, and social status, discussing such films as What Price Hollywood?, The Bride Wore Red, and The Bitter Tea of General Yen; big-budget, style-driven vehicles such as Fashions of 1934 and Vogues of 1938; and musicals, costume dramas, and Technicolor extravaganzas. <br>
<br>
Screen Style explores the consumer economy that was still a novelty in the 1930s, as well as the shift from ""class"" to ""mass"" fashion marketing. Berry analyzes Hollywood and fashion-industry perceptions of the huge potential buying power of women, both as purchasers of goods for the entire family and as filmgoers, and the subsequent boom in star endorsements and merchandising, fashion publicity for upcoming films, and movie tie-ins of clothes and accessories. Wide-ranging changes accompanied the popularization of fashion, including the growing acceptance of cosmetic use and women's appropriation of pants. The fact that more women than ever before were working outside of the home led to a blurring of the social distinctions that fashion had traditionally served to accentuate-and, as a result, popular fashion provided women with a new tool to challenge and shape their roles in society. <br>

1-55861-237-8,Life Prints: A Memoir of Healing and Discovery (The Cross-Cultural Memoir Series),"Grimley Mason, Mary",The Feminist Press at CUNY,240,6/1/2000,,Hardcover,"<p>When she is six, Mary Grimley is the nation's first ""poster child,"" dining with President Roosevelt at the Warm Springs rehabilitation center and posing in her wheelchair for publicity shots. But a close look at photos reveals something other than the ""cheerful invalid"" that the abled expect: mouth closed in a frown, eyes defiant and proud, this bold child is less than impressed with the label of ""poor crippled girl.""</p>
<p>As a brilliant young scholar in the 1950s and 1960s, Mary Grimley Mason refuses to focus on her disability and instead makes herself privy to a revolution of ideas. At Radcliffe College and in graduate school at the University of Chicago and Harvard, she surrounds herself with writers and thinkers, plunging into the bohemian lifestyle of Cambridge cooperatives and radical intellectualism. But inchoate concepts of ""normalcy"" soon twist Mason's path, and she finds herself married to another scholar, supporting his studies, keeping house, and raising children. Even during several years in Paris, she is positioned to overhear rather than participate in conversations with scholars and writers such as Louis Massignon. Years of conflict result in a difficult realization: she has laid aside her own dream to become the dream of another-""the perfect wife of a writer,"" as Frank O'Connor predicted.</p>
<p>Mason has spent her life struggling against prejudice toward disabled people; now she has discovered an even more formidable enemy: the sexism of mentors, friends, family, and even herself. But she will find the courage to contend with both of the forces that seek to define and limit her. After undergoing years of physical therapy and social isolation, after forcing the strictures of disability behind her, she at last accepts her identity as a disabled person, abandoning ""that double in my life-that consciousness or voice that tried to pass as able-bodied."" At the same time, she moves beyond the limitations society has prescribed for women, embracing feminism-and discovering her life's work. Specializing academically in women's autobiography, Mary Grimley Mason is unusually well-suited to narrate and interpret her own life, taking control of its representation with forthright determination.

A champion of civil rights and racial justice and an advocate for the poor and disenfranchised, Pauley's tenacity as an activist and the length of her career are remarkable. She is also a consummate storyteller; for decades, she has shared her words with activists, students, and scholars who have found their way to her door.</p>
<p>Kathryn L. Nasstrom uses rich oral history material, recorded by herself and others, to present Frances Pauley in her own words. Pauley's life has encompassed much of the last century of extraordinary social change in the South, a life touching and touched by famous figures from southern politics and the civil rights movement. Highlights of Pauley's career in the public eye include a friendship with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King, encounters with several of Georgia's civil-rights-era governors, and a meeting with Eleanor Roosevelt. A skillful political organizer, Pauley was involved in decades of community mobilization, repeated efforts to educate politicians and the public about the origins and nature of poverty, and lobbying for unpopular causes. ""People are born into a certain way of living,"" she says. ""It takes a jolt to get out of it. It doesn't really mean that they're all that mean and bad, but it takes a jolt to make them see that maybe they could make a change.""</p>
<p>In a deft blend of biography and memoir, Nasstrom explains Pauley's historical significance and places her story in the context of developments in Georgia politics and the civil rights movement. Even as it contributes to the political history of Georgia and the South, affording insight of unusual depth on familiar issues and events, the book preserves one woman's story in the still largely undocumented history of southern women's social and political activism in the twentieth century. Pauley's experiences serve as a window on the lives of all those women and men who, town by town and state by state, made momentous change not only possible but also inescapable.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/23/9780801437823.jpg,Success,111,22.6

How Useful Are These Terms? What Exactly Do They Mean? And How Is Our Sense Of These Terms Changing Under The Pressure Of Feminist Analysis? In Doing Time, Rita Felski Argues That It Makes Little Sense To Think Of The Modern And Postmodern As Opposing Or Antithetical Terms. Rather, We Need A Historical Perspective That Is Attuned To Cultural And Political Differences Within The Same Time As Well As The Leaky Boundaries Between Different Times. Neither The Modern Nor The Postmodern Are Unified, Coherent, Or Self-evident Realities. Drawing On Cultural Studies And Critical Theory, Felski Examines A Range Of Themes Central To Debates About Postmodern Culture, Including Changing Meanings Of Class, The End Of History, The Status Of Art And Aesthetics, Postmodernism As The End Of Sex, And The Politics Of Popular Culture. Placing Women At The Center Of Analysis, She Suggests, Has A Profound Impact On The Way We Think About Historical Periods.

What was your mother's experience when she had you? Do you long for a deeper bond with your loved ones? In <i>Reclaiming the Spirituality of Birth</i>, Benig Mauger suggests that our prenatal and birth experiences affect us for the rest of our lives. And because our modern approach to birth separates mothers from their primordial knowledge of natural delivery, many people suffer from lifelong birth wounds. Mauger invites women to reclaim the connection to their own instinctive, intuitive, and inherently spiritual creative powers. <p>The West's rational, mechanistic worldview wreaks havoc with the birth experience as it leads to ever increasing levels of high-tech medical intervention. Induced labor, fetal monitors, and pain-killing drugs alter the natural rhythms of delivery. This scientific approach puts medical personnel in control of the birth process, leaving mothers and their babies with a profound sense of loss. Drawing on her experience as a birth teacher, therapist, and mother, Benig Mauger suggests that by reconnecting with the natural and spiritual world an expectant mother can make the birth experience her own, thereby healing old wounds and allowing herself both a deeply satisfying delivery and an abiding spiritual connection to her child. <p>Benig Mauger founded the Holistic Birth Centre in London in the 1980s and has an extensive background in childbirth education. Currently she has a private psychotherapy practice in Dublin, where she also lectures and runs workshops.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/69/9780892818969.jpg,Success,107,22.6

0-375-75603-5,Necessary Targets: A Story of Women and War,"Ensler, Eve",Villard,122,1/23/2001,,Paperback,"<p>In her first new work since The Vagina Monologues, her Obie Award-winning smash hit, Eve Ensler tells the story of two American women, a Park Avenue psychiatrist and a human rights worker, who go to Bosnia to help women confront their memories of war and emerge deeply changed themselves.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Ensler's sober new play may seem like an unexpected astringent after her celebrity-studded performance piece and book, The Vagina Monologues, an alternately piercing and raucous series of vignettes that dramatize women's conflicts over body image and sexuality that continues to be performed around the country. Here, Ensler's major theme is the lingering effects of violence against women. Two American women--a well-heeled New York psychiatrist and her younger colleague--travel to a refugee camp intending to help Bosnian women ""tell their stories"" after the brutal war in Yugoslavia. Inexperienced in the field, the doctor learns to stop patronizing and start listening, while her more brittle companion retreats into therapeutic jargon. ""When we think of war, we think of it as something that happens to men in fields or jungles,"" says the award-winning playwright in her introduction. ""But after the bombing, after the snipers, that's when the real war begins."" Though deeply political, Ensler's work has no ideological axes to grind, nor does it linger sensationally on rape stories. Spare, self-reflexive and powerful, the play zeroes in on the real postwar conflict: the refugees' contempt for bland, professional talk therapy--and their overwhelming need, at the same time, for help in absorbing the damages. Agent, Charlotte Sheedy. (Feb. 2) Forecast: Though Ensler's new subject matter is darker and less familiar to American women than that of The Vagina Monologues (which sold more than 60,000 copies), Ensler knows her audience and how to attract attention (she appeared on Oprah last fall). Her five-city tour and print campaign targeting college newspapers, in addition to the play's opening in New York in March 2001, will ensure that her devotees take notice.

<p>As Britain's wartime blockade of goods to Central Europe increasingly squeezed the German food supply, public protests led by ""women of little means"" broke out in the streets of Berlin and other German cities. These ""street scenes"" riveted public attention and drew urban populations together across class lines to make formidable, apparently unified demands on the German state. Imperial authorities responded in unprecedented fashion in the interests of beleaguered consumers, interceding actively in food distribution and production. But officials' actions were far more effective in legitimating popular demands than in defending the state's right to rule. In the end, says Davis, this dynamic fundamentally reformulated relations between state and society and contributed to the state's downfall in 1918. Shedding new light on the Wilhelmine government, German subjects' role as political actors, and the influence of the war on the home front on the Weimar state and society, <i>Home Fires Burning</i> helps rewrite the political history of World War I Germany.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.18 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches",42,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/71/9780807848371.jpg,Success,111,22.6

Out of the blue, a monastery in India for which she had raised some money contacted Burroughs and asked her to host His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, one of the highest-ranking lamas of Tibetan Buddhism, on his first visit to America. After meeting Burroughs, and observing her and her followers for a period of five days, he told her that she was a ""great, great bodhisattva,"" and already, unbeknownst to her, practicing Buddhism. Later, in India, he officially recognized this Jewish-Italian woman from Brooklyn as the reincarnation of a sixteenth-century Ti-betan saint, making her the first American woman to be named a tulku, or reborn lama. 
<p><i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i> tells the complex and fascinating story of how Catharine Burroughs, now known as Jetsunma Ahkön Lhamo, embarked on a journey to build the largest Tibetan Buddhist center in America. With boundless enthusiasm but precious little formal training in Buddhist practices and traditions, Jetsunma and her students bought an estate in Poolesville, Maryland, on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., and founded Kunzang Palyul Choling (Fully Awakened Dharma Continent of Absolute Clear Light). Under Jetsunma's tutelage, the group memorized sacred texts and held all-night prayer vigils. They asked venerable Tibetan lamas to visit and give them ""empowerments."" Many took Buddhist vows and became monks and nuns. And as word of this remarkable place spread, others came to see the new lama for themselves and joined her community.</p>
<p>Martha Sherrill, a writer at <i>The Washington Post</i>, heard about Jetsunma in 1993. She visited the center and was charmed by both its charismatic lama, the only Western woman in the male-dominated hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism, and by the monks and nuns (all Americans) living there. They seemed, for the most part, like a remarkably happy group of people whose lives had been transformed by this exotic, imported faith—and by Jetsunma. At the beginning of <i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i>, as the group is breaking ground for a sacred monument called a stupa, Sherrill commences her own journey to discover for herself what makes this unlikely lama—who enjoys clothes shopping and manicures, Motown music and <i>Star Trek</i> reruns—such a magnetic spiritual leader. And as the story unfolds, so do the secrets of this seemingly idyllic sanctuary.</p>
<p>Compassionate and clear-eyed, Sherrill takes her readers on a breathtaking exploration inside the monastery at Poolesville, a place where idealistic but flawed human beings struggle with their devotion every day. She demystifies monastic life and Tibetan Buddhism, and amends the simplified view that most Americans have of this 2,500-year-old faith. Weaving together the stories of the believers into a narrative structure that is as moving and beautiful as the stupa they are building, Sherrill has created a brilliant work of investigative journalism that raises profound, provocative questions about religious faith and its price. <i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i> is a monument to the miracles and failures that stem from the deepest human longings.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/51/9780679452751.jpg,Success,133,22.6
0-8264-1184-3,The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory,"Adams, Carol J.",Continuum Intl Pub Group,272,1999,,Paperback,"<p class=""null1"">First published in 1990, <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i> is a landmark text in the ongoing debates about animal rights. In the two decades since, the book has inspired controversy and heated debate.</p>
<p><i>T</i> <i>he Sexual Politics of Meat</i> argues that what, or more precisely who, we eat is determined by the patriarchal politics of our culture, and that the meanings attached to meat eating are often clustered around virility. We live in a world in which men still have considerable power over women, both in public and in private. Carol Adams argues that gender politics is inextricably related to how we view animals, especially animals who are consumed. Further, she argues that vegetarianism and fighting for animal rights fit perfectly alongside working to improve the lives of disenfranchised and suffering people, under the wide umbrella of compassionate activism.</p>
<p>This 20th Anniversary Edition includes a new preface by the author, discussing new developments in the field and answering some of her critics. It also features an introduction by Nellie McKay. If you have never read <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat,</i> prepare to have your worldview challenged — and possibly turned upside down — like tens of thousands of readers before you.</p>
<p class=""null1"">Praise for <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i>:</p>
<p>""A bible of the vegan community."" <i>—The New York Times</i></p>
<p>""Her argument is rational and persuasive....New ground - whole acres of it - is broken by Adams."" <i>—Washington Post Book World</i></p>
<p>""Read this powerful new book and you may well become a vegetarian."" <i>—Ms. Magazine</i></p>
<p>""Both thoughtful and thought-provoking."" —Kirkus Reviews</p>
<p>""Likely to both inspire and enrage readers across the political spectrum."" <i>—Library Journal</i></p>
<p>""Carol J. Adams's original, provocative book makes a major contribution to the debate on animal rights."" <i>—Publisher's Weekly</i></p>
<p><b>CAROL J. ADAMS</b> is the author of <i>The Pornography of Meat</i> (Continuum, 2004), and co-author of <i>Beyond Animal Rights</i> (Continuum, 2000), and <i>The Bedside, Bathtub, and Armchair Companion to Jane Austen</i> (Continuum, 2008). She has toured as a speaker throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. More information can be found at her website: http://www.triroc.com/caroladams</p>


                        <p>In just over a year, the book with the strange title--and even strager ideas, some would say--has become the classic articulation of the hidden connections between meat eating and patriarchy, between vegetarianism and feminism. Now in paperback and widely available to readers everywhere, The Sexual Politics of Meat will have an even larger impact on the American public.

In 1993, historian Jacqueline Tobin met African American quilter Ozella Williams amid piles of beautiful handmade quilts in the Old Market Building of Charleston, South Carolina. With the admonition to &quot;write this down,&quot; Williams began to describe how slaves made coded quilts and used them to navigate their escape on the Underground Railroad. But just as quickly as she started, Williams stopped, informing Tobin that she would learn the rest when she was &quot;ready.&quot;&#160;&#160; During the three years it took for Williams's narrative to unfold--and as the friendship and trust between the two women grew--Tobin enlisted Raymond Dobard, Ph.D., an art history professor and well-known African American quilter, to help unravel the mystery.<br><br>Part adventure and part history, <b>Hidden in Plain View</b> traces the origin of the Charleston Code from Africa to the Carolinas, from the low-country island Gullah peoples to free blacks living in the cities of the North, and shows how three people from completely different backgrounds pieced together one amazing American story.</p>",en,1st Anchor Books,"Height: 8 inches, Length: 5.1 inches, Weight: 0.53792791928 Pounds, Width: 0.7 inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/71/9780385497671.jpg,Success,130,22.6

Patients, their families, environmental activists, physicians, attorneys, and all of those working toward prevention will find this book interesting, informative, and insightful.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Writing for the general reader, Sherman, a practicing internist and the author of Chemical Exposure and Disease, explores the numerous associations between environmental pollution and breast cancer. Her investigation specifically targets hormones (natural and synthetic), radiation (including mammography), and toxic chemicals as prime historical and current cancer-causing agents. Undoubtedly, Sherman's text will prove controversial as the scientific jury is still out on exactly how to prevent cancer and precisely how and when the genetic changes that result in malignancy occur. Rachel Carson introduced the public to the links between pollution and breast cancer in her groundbreaking Silent Spring (1962). Few readers today will be unaware of pollution's public health implications, so this book best serves as a continued clarion call to clean up the environment. Overall, it is well written and provides a riveting account of corporate and institutional (mis)investments in the Cancer Wars.

The Académie Julian was founded in Paris in 1868, initially to prepare students for entry to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the nineteenth-century's preeminent art school. Because women could not study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts until 1897, Julian itself became an international equivalent for many of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century's most important women artists.</p>
<p>Not only does <i>Overcoming All Obstacles</i> introduce the reader to many works by women artists-both famous and lesser known-but the essays offer a cultural and historical context in which to appreciate their art. Gabriel Weisberg's essay concentrates on the rigorous training methods enforced by Rodolphe Julian and the teachers at the Academy. Jane Becker explores the competitive environment of the Julian Academy as it affected the Ukrainian painter Marie Bashkirtseff and the Swiss painter Louise-Catherine Breslau. Essays by Catherine Fehrer, the leading scholar of the Académie Julian, and Tamar Garb, an art historian who focuses on the training of women artists, give us a richer understanding of the Académie Julian's place in the sphere of art education in late nineteenth-century Paris.</p>
<p>Generously illustrated with both color and black-and-white images, this volume includes documentary photographs and caricatures that have never before been reproduced. The core of the book draws on the large collection of the Académie Julian Del Debbio, the Académie Julian's successor institution in Paris. This publication accompanied an exhibition organized by the Dahesh Museum in New York that opened after its exhibition at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown.&nbsp; The exhibition subsequently continued to the Dixon Gallery and Gardens, Memphis.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1.9 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",65,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/50/9780813527550.jpg,Success,109,22.6

After two years at the pre-school, five-year-old Jimmy had failed to make any friends, had recently started to act aggressively towards his classmates, and was beginning to react violently to any changes in his routine. Echo was not taken completely by surprise: she had suspected for some time that her son was different from other children. Over the next five years, she and her husband accompanied Jimmy to doctors, medical specialists, learning consultants and psychologists. Finally, at the age of ten, Jimmy was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. This is the book that Echo Fling needed when she first set out to have Jimmy diagnosed, and it will enable parents and teachers to understand and help other children with Asperger Syndrome.

The Little Locksmith begins in 1895 when a specialist straps five-year-old Katharine, then suffering from spinal tuberculosis, to a board with halters and pulleys in a failed attempt to prevent her being a ""hunchback."" Her mother says that she should be thankful that her parents are able to have her cared for by a famous surgeon; otherwise, she would grow up to be like the ""little locksmith,"" who does jobs at their home; he has a ""strange, awful peak in his back."" Forced to endure ""a horizontal life of night and day,"" Katharine remains immobile until age fifteen, only to find that she, too, has a hunched back and is ""no larger than a ten-year-old child."" The Little Locksmith charts Katharine's struggle to transcend physical limitations and embrace her life, her body and herself in the face of debilitating bouts of frustration and shame. Her spirit and courage prevail, and she succeeds in expanding her world far beyond the boundaries prescribed by her family and society: she attends Radcliffe College, forms deep friendships, begins to write, and in 1921, purchases a house of her own in Castine, Maine. There she creates her home, room by room, fashioning it as a space for guests, lovers, and artists. <i>The Little Locksmith</i> stands as a testimony to Katharine's aspirations and desires-for independence, for love, and for the pursuit of her art.</p>
<p>""We tend to forget nowadays that there is more than one variety of hero (and heroine). Katharine Butler Hathaway, who died last Christmas Eve, was the kind of heroine whose deeds are rarely chronicled. They were not spectacular and no medal would have been appropriate for her. All she did was to take a life which fate had cast in the mold of a frightful tragedy and redesign it into a quiet, modest work of art. The life was her own.</p>

Replacing utopianism with realism helps to eliminate self-defeating notions in feminist theory, such as false generalization, idealization, and unnecessary dichotomies. Realistic thought, however, allows feminist theory to respond to changing circumstances, acknowledge sameness as well as difference, value the past and the present, and respect ideological give-and-take. <p> An important critique of feminist thought, Kitch concludes with a clear, exciting vision for a feminist future without utopia.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9369646135 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",6,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/73/9780226438573.jpg,Success,116,22.6

 ""A marvelous, witty, learned, and sexy book. <i>Bisexuality</i> is destined for landmark status--no one who reads its bold, persuasive argument will ever think the same way about sex.""<br>
<b>-Diane Middlebrook,</b> author of <i>Anne Sexton</i><br>
 ""<i>Bisexuality</i> uncovers a subject long buried deep within the closet of America's cultural unconscious. Garber's capacities as a cultural commentator--delivered here in funny, witty, and sexy prose--are quite dazzling. A tour de force of social criticism, <i>Bisexuality</i> is in itself a cultural event.""<br>
<b>-Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b><br>
 The world is flat. The sun revolves around the earth. Human beings are either heterosexual or homosexual. The first two myths have long been abandoned, but the third has awaited its Columbus or Copernicus. Until now.<br>
 In this witty, learned, and scrupulously researched book, Marjorie Garber examines bisexuality and its many modes through a dazzling variety of critical lenses: cultural, literary, and psychological. <i>Bisexuality</i> is a monumental inquiry into what ""normal"" might mean, and just how difficult it is to make claims about sexuality-someone else's or one's own. Whether you're curious or seriously interested, a lay reader or a student of sexuality or gender, <i>Bisexuality</i> is a book you will have to have. <br>

The twenty-seven-year old women's studies major at San Diego State University was the director of the campus Women's Resource Center and a self-defense instructor. Nevertheless, in the early morning hours of November 5, 1994, she was brutally murdered in the apartment that she had shared with her boyfriend, Andres English-Howard. Days later, English-Howard was arrested on suspicion of murder. In August 1995, he was convicted of first-degree murder. The night before he was scheduled to appear in court for sentencing, English-Howard hanged himself in his jail cell.
<p>By all standard definitions, O'Donnell was not victim. She was self-assured, strong-willed, a feminist. Yet, she became a victim. If it could happen to her, her friends feared, it could happen to anybody. Author Kathleen B. Jones, one of O'Donnell's professors, was particularly shaken by her death. In Living Between Danger and Love, she examines O'Donnell's death and what it has to say to all of us.</p>
<p>Grafting memoir with autobiography, Jones recounts riveting episodes in her own life that parallel O'Donnell's. Adding to these memories, she narrates crises faced by others she has come to know who shared stories of domestic violence.

Everything conspires against the single, childless man. Each new living thing in the world each day says: You are alone, and not getting younger.<br>
<br>
At the age of thirty-seven, the journalist and novelist Jesse Green found his life dramatically changing when he met and fell in love with a man who had recently adopted a baby boy. Having long since made peace with his choice not to be a parent, Green now faced the shock and the responsibility of a fatherhood he had never imagined. The Velveteen Father is his candid, heartfelt, and often hilarious account of the formation and flourishing of a family.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In intimate, graceful prose, Green describes his partner's journey from the hedonistic eighties to the realization that he wanted to have a child; his own concurrent journey to find a way to become an adult without having a child; and their journey together to become good parents in a society whose reactions to unconventional families can be both funny and frightening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In the classic bedtime story, a velveteen rabbit is made real at last by a child's true love. <i>The Velveteen FatherM</i> is a moving record of the transformative effect parenthood can have on people who least expect to become parents, of how we are repeatedly made anew by the love of children who need us. But this transformation is not just the province of parents, Green writes; only by addressing, in some way, the generations that come before and after us can we face the task of becoming real. The Velveteen Father will therefore interest anyone who has considered—or would consider—having achild.",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/99/9780345437099.jpg,Success,68,22.6

When her mother first becomes ill, Ernaux takes her in. Soon, it becomes painfully obvious that professional help is needed. Diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, her mother enters a nursing home, never to leave. As it explores the complexities of death and parent-child role reversal, Ernaux's latest work takes its place on the shelf beside John Bayley's Elegy for Iris and Roger Kamenetz's Terra Infirma. ""As revealed by Ernaux, the details of a loved one's deterioration have such emblematic force and terror that the particular becomes universal."" - The New York Times Book Review</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Unlike Aaron Alterra's The Caregiver (LJ 10/15/99), this slim volume by noted French writer Ernaux (Simple Passion) is not a straightforward medical account of her mother's death from Alzheimer's; instead, it is a collection of the notes, in their original form, that Ernaux jotted down at the time of her mother's illness. ""When I write down all these things, I scribble away as fast as I can (as if I felt guilty), without choosing my words."" Here in their raw, uncensored form are the ""vestiges of pain""--the anger, guilt, and grief that Ernaux felt during her mother's two-year decline. Here are the graphic images of her once-powerful mother wearing diapers, the woman in the next bed peeing on the floor, a drawer in the bedside table filled with a human turd. Because the notes have not been edited, there is a choppy, unpolished feel to the book, which is perhaps Ernaux's intention--as a possible counterpoint to A Woman's Story (1991), her fictionalized memoir of her mother's life and death.

Coming to power just before the unstable state was about to be absorbed into an autocratic empire, Cleopatra oversaw not only Egypt's progress as an influential regional power but also the fragile peace of its ethnically mixed population.<P> Michel Chauveau looks at many facets of life under this queen and her dynasty, drawing on such sources as firsthand accounts, numismatics, and Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphic inscriptions. His use of such sources helps to free the narrative of dependence on later (and usually hostile) Greek and Roman historians. By taking up such subjects as funeral customs, language and writing, social class structure, religion, and administration, he affords the reader an unprecedented and comprehensive picture of Greek and Egyptian life in both the cities and the countryside.<P> Originally published in French in 1997, Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra fulfills a long-standing need for an accessible introduction to the social, economic, religious, military, and cultural history of Ptolemaic Egypt.<br><p><B>About the Author:</b><BR> Michel Chauveau is a former member of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo, and is currently director of studies at L'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris.

In 1938, just before they were killed by the Nazis, Freida and Siegmund Westerfeld sent their twelve-year-old daughter Edith to live with relatives in Chicago. Edith escaped the death camps but was left profoundly adrift, cut off from culture, tradition, her entire identity. For decades she shut away her memories, until she realized that the void of her past was consuming her and her family. Then, with her daughter Fern Schumer Chapman--herself a pregnant mother--Edith returned to Germany. <br>
<br>
For Edith the trip was an act of courage, a chance to reconnect with her homeland and reconcile with her past. For Fern it was a miraculous opening, a break in the wall of silence surrounding her mother's past... and her mother. A memoir as lyrical as a novel, <i>Motherland</i> is the narrative of a personal transformation that examines the legacy of war. It is the story of learning to live with the past, of remembering and honoring while looking forward and letting go. In the tradition of Bernhard Schlink's <i>The Reader</i>, <i>Motherland</i> probes a pain that shatters nations, divides generations, and outlives its perpetrators. <br>
<br>
A riveting read, <i>Motherland</i> echoes Ursula Hegi's <i>Stones from the River</i>. It is a loving yet harrowing story of mothers and daughters; of expectations and limitations; of roots, reunion, and ultimately understanding.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/55/9780670881055.jpg,Success,128,22.6

In January 1947 Simone de Beauvoir landed at La Guardia airport and began a four-month journey that took her from one coast of the United States to the other, and back again. Embraced by the Condé Nast set in a swirl of cocktail parties in New York, where she was hailed as the ""prettiest existentialist"" by Janet Flanner in <i>The New Yorker</i>, de Beauvoir traveled west by car, train, and Greyhound, immersing herself in the nation's culture, customs, people, and landscape. The detailed diary she kept of her trip became <i>America Day by Day,</i> published in France in 1948 and offered here in a completely new translation. It is one of the most intimate, warm, and compulsively readable texts from the great writer's pen.<br>
Fascinating passages are devoted to Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and San Antonio. We see de Beauvoir gambling in a Reno casino, smoking her first marijuana cigarette in the Plaza Hotel, donning raingear to view Niagara Falls, lecturing at Vassar College, and learning firsthand about the Chicago underworld of morphine addicts and petty thieves with her lover Nelson Algren as her guide. This fresh, faithful translation superbly captures the essence of Simone de Beauvoir's distinctive voice. It demonstrates once again why she is one of the most profound, original, and influential writers and thinkers of the twentieth century.<br>
<b>On New York:</b>""I walk between the steep cliffs at the bottom of a canyon where no sun penetrates: it's permeated by a salt smell. Human history is not inscribed on these carefully calibrated buildings: They are closer to prehistoric caves than to the houses of Paris or Rome.""<br>

Yet they still struggle with the bloody instincts that have tormented humanity since time immemorial. ThreeSys is a triangle of stars with eleven planets each, where people are divided into three classes-Meshed, Jacked, and Jackless-a caste system of technological access. ""Mesh"" has emerged as the universe's single greatest power: a tiny elite of Meshed humans can access unsurpassed knowledge, enter another dimension, and manipulate lesser mortals' reality.
<p>But three of these gifted humans-Eve, Corey, and Annmarie-have harnessed this power for their own evil ends. Traveling throughout ThreeSys, the trio devotes their extraordinary abilities to selling what they claim is an end to all wars and aggression. What they're actually selling is Staze, an opiumlike, instantly addictive drug that wraps the user in dreams and lethargy. Yet some Jacked and Jackless have retaliated against this and other abuses of power, mercilessly hunting down and killing Meshed humans.</p>
<p>Time is running out for the three, even as ebony-hued Eve falls in love with lower caste Naverdi, who's Jacked, a supplier of a key Staze ingredient, and an addict herself. The only answer is on Paradise, the first ThreeSys planet where humans ever set foot. Paradise hadn't survived its first brush with human habitation, and was blasted from its orbit into another solar system millennia ago. Now it's the only place where the Mesh is intact-the old Mesh, the original Mesh, the real one.</p>

Its story begins in 1822, when members of the white minority, terrified by the narrowly averted Denmark Vesey slave revolt, hastily organized a private militia. Twenty years later that small home guard was remade into a military college for young white men. Through two world wars the school grew in size and reputation. But The Citadel began to falter in the 1960s. As America wrestled with calls for social change, cadets clung to antique hierarchies born of slavery and war. While careful courtesies were maintained in public, archaic rituals and brutal hazings were carried out behind closed doors.
<p> In 1993, a young woman named Shannon Faulkner acted as the agent of change. When the school rescinded her admission solely because of her gender, she filed a lawsuit. A landmark legal battle ensued, which Faulkner won and which ultimately forced reform on The Citadel. Though Faulkner faced vicious harassment and left after a week, she paved the way for the women who have graduated since. In Glory's Shadow is an engrossing and illuminating look at this pivotal event in military history and the history of women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",26.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/54/9780679446354.jpg,Success,132,22.6

<p>THE MOUNTAIN</p>
<p>I: A Metaphor</p>
<p>The mountain as metaphor looms large in the lives of marginalized people, people whose bones get crushed in the grind of capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy. How many of us have struggled up the mountain, measured ourselves against the mountain, failed on the mountain, lived in the shadow of the mountain, hit our heads on glass ceilings, tried to climb the class ladder, lost the fight against assimilation, struggled our way toward that phantom called normality?</p>
<p>We hear from the summit that the world is the best from up there. Hear that we are lazy, stupid, weak, ugly, that we live at the bottom precisely because we are those things. We decide to climb that mountain, or make a pact that our children will climb it. The climbing turns out to be unimaginably difficult. We are afraid; every time we look ahead we can find nothing remotely familiar or comfortable. We lose the trail. Our wheelchairs get stuck. We speak the wrong languages with the wrong accents, wear the wrong clothes, carry our bodies the wrong ways, ask the wrong questions, love the wrong people. And it's goddamn lonely up there on the mountain. We decide to stop climbing and build a new house right where we are. Or we decide to climb back down to the people we love where the food, the clothes, the dirt, the sidewalk, the steaming asphalt under our feet, our crutches all feel right. Or we find the path again, decide to continue climbing only to have the very people who told us how wonderful life is at the summit booby trap the trail. They burn the bridge over the impassable canyon. They redraw our topo maps so that we end up walking in circles. They send their goons-those working-class and poor people they employ as their official brutes-to push us over the edge. Maybe we get to the summit but p</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",14,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/50/9780896086050.jpg,Success,96,22.6

Bob trades in his artist's palette for a minivan full of house paints, hammers, and nails, and sets about earning a little cash as a handyman.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>Although he turns out to be very bad at fixing the things he's hired to fix, Bob demonstrates quite a knack for fixing the lives of the people around him.

Miller produces poignant revelations about what it means to live with a dying parent—as a son or daughter, as well as the difference that gender makes in such a painful situation. In Bequest and Betrayal, she develops an original feminist perspective by counterpointing lyrical introspection about her own grief with critical insights into memoirs by Simone de Beauvoir, Philip Roth, Art Spiegelman, Susan Cheever, Carolyn Steedman, and Annie Ernaux."" —Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, co-authors of The Madwoman in the Attic, No Man's Land, and The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women</p>
<p>""Miller's use of the memoir form offers a new model of serious criticism, and a way of imagining community through ‘bonds of paper’ as well as ‘bonds of blood.’"" —Elaine Showalter, London Review of Books</p>
<p>Melding the details of her own experience with the familial biographies of well-known contemporary writers, Miller recreates a common experience—the loss of a father or a mother—and exposes the often tortuous paths of mourning and attachment that we follow in the wake of loss. In the process, she offers pieces of personal history, revealing the mixed emotions provoked by her mother's sudden death from cancer and her father's painful struggle with Parkinson's disease. Memoirs about the loss of parents show how enmeshed in the family plot we have been and the price of our complicity in its stories. The death of parents forces us to rethink our lives, to reread ourselves. We read for what we need to find. Sometimes, we also find what we didn't know we needed.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.59083886216 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches",20,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/92/9780253213792.jpg,Success,112,22.6

<p>After you meet Mr. Right, at some point in the relationship you will both say, ""I love you."" What do you mean when you say, ""I love you""? What does he mean when he says, ""I love you""? What does anyone mean when he says it? Love is a word we have all used at one time or another, but it is also a word that carries many meanings.</p>
<p>I have asked hundreds of gay men, ""What is love?"" and there has been no shared or agreed-upon answer. Even lovers have different answers. When I ask male couples who are experiencing major problems why they are staying together, they usually say, ""Because we love each other."" This answer doesn't tell me much.</p>
<p>What does love mean to you? Your answer is important and may help you understand your past, present, and future relationships. It may also help you figure out why you may have trouble forming and developing long-term relationships.</p>
<p class=""null1"">What You May Have Learned About Love</p>
<p>As a child, you learned that if you were really good, your mother said, ""I love you."" If you were punished for being bad, you may have been told, ""Mommy still loves you."" Early in life you learned what you needed to do to be loved. You conformed to your parents' expectations, which guaranteed your parents' love and protection. You believed you wouldn't be abandoned if you met their expectations. You believed you were safe if you were loved. As a child, you tested your parents' love and their limits. You placed demands on them to make sure they continued to love you. You learned from your parents about love.</p>
<p>As an adolescent, you learned about love from television, movies, and friends. You found yourself attracted to someone, and you were told you were in love. You may have also been told this was puppy love or adolescent love and that it would not last long. You saw sexual intimacy and were then told this was love. You learned the word love and associated it with various definitions.</p>
<p>Love has different meanings for different people, which makes it almost impossible to know how the word is being used by anyone. Some of the following expressions are just a few uses of the word love:</p>

Only via Trinidad will Chatty Cathy enter a villanelle, or Garbo's troll collection find itself unveiled in terza rima. Yet Trinidad's high/low playfulness thoroughly displays a smart, sharp art of arrangement--be the subject Fat Liz / Bad Anne; Barbie, Ken, Midge, Allan, and Skipper; Marilyn Monroe's psyche; or 116 lines cribbed from everyone from Matthew Arnold to JamesWright. The book masterfully renders the obsessive aspects of popular culture-collectibility, relentless camp, larger-than-life power dynamics-and the odd way they reflect the poignant complexities of making choices. This is plainly evident in the many shorter poems on the vicissitudes of collecting, like Accessories (comb,/ brush and `real' mirror) or Fortunes (You are just beginning to live), and in Essay with Movable Parts, a long poem that intersperses images of the poet's nascent doll collection with subversively intelligent snapshots from a range of cheesy classics, including Valley of the Dolls and episodes of Gilligan's Island. A second long poem, Every Night, Byron is written from the perspective of the poet's lover's dog, hilariously summoning up The Autobiogrpahy of Alice B. Toklas as if written by Basket: David's packages in-/ terested me at first,/ until I realized they/ were full of the same/ old (as Ira calls it)/ `Barbie Crap' ./ David hemmed and/ hawed: `When/ words and people/ fail me, I have no/ choice but to take/ refuge in things.' Ira/ didn't buy it; neither/ did I. This is Trinidad's finest work to date, and readers will do well to take refuge in its shiny, humane splendors, even if doubting the value of disposable culture in and of itself. (Mar.)

Ten years later, having found nothing else at which she can distinguish herself, Lucy tries to save the Eden by capitalizing on a wave of nostalgia for the Borscht Belt and running the hotel as a sort of living museum of Yiddish culture. In the course of the season, Lucy battles her grandmother's attempts to sabotage Lucy's success, her parents' superstitious fears of anything that attracts attention to the Jews, and her brother's contention that what Lucy is doing is more a matter of ego than authentic religious feeling. In the meantime, Lucy comes to realize her love for Mr. Jefferson, the hotel's longtime black handyman, and begins to face the barriers that stand between them. On top of all this, Lucy must contend with a Hasid who buys the chicken farm next door; a cell of ancient Jewish Communists who instigate a strike among Eden's overworked young staff; a gay chef and gay baker who want to prove to the world that kosher cuisine can satisfy the most sophisticated gourmet; and Jimmy Kilcoin - an Irish Catholic Insurance adjustor known as ""the Don Juan of the Catskills"" - who is determined to seduce Lucy before summer's end.",en,New Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/96/9781566397896.jpg,Success,115,22.6

Henrietta",Texas A&M University Press,136,3/1/2000,,Hardcover,"<p>White Painted Woman appears in ancient myths of the Chiricahua Apaches as the virgin mother of the people and the origin of women’s ceremonies. Such Chiricahua myths and traditions have closely prescribed the roles of women in relation to their husbands and children, to relatives and extended families, and to the band or tribe. One of those roles is to safeguard and hand on to the next generation the lore and customs of the people. In this way, Chiricahua women have served as safekeepers of a heritage that is now endangered. For more than a decade, H. Henrietta Stockel has moved with remarkable freedom and intimacy among the Chiricahuas, especially in the women’s friendship circles. With their permission and even blessing, she has observed and recorded aspects of their traditional culture that otherwise might be lost to history.Chiricahua Apache Women and Children, written in a familiar, personal style, focuses on the duties and experiences of historical Chiricahua Apache women and the significant influences they have exerted within the family and the tribe at large.After beginning with a look at creation myths, Stockel turns to family patterns and roles. She describes in detail the puberty ceremony she has repeatedly witnessed, a ceremony little known by those outside the band. Stockel looks also at the alternative lifestyle, also culturally prescribed, of four women warriors. She concludes with Mildred Cleghorn, a contemporary “woman warrior” who was chairperson of the Fort Sill Chiricahua/Warm Springs Apache Tribe in Oklahoma for nearly twenty years and who was also Stockel's close friend and “Apache mother.” Beautifully complemented with thirty-two black-and-white illustrations of women, children, and family life, Chiricahua Apache Women and Children offers a vivid glimpse into traditional Chiricahua Apache women’s lifestyles.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/12/9780890969212.jpg,Success,115,22.6

Decades later, she realized that in her efforts to achieve normality she had not spoken to her children or her grandchildren of her terrifying odyssey. Her memoir of the period between 1939 and 1945, was written for her children so that they would <i>Inherit the Truth</i>.</p><p>This is the story of the destruction of a talented Jewish family, and of the survival against all the odds of two young sisters. Anita and her elder sister Renate defied death at the hands of the Gestapo and the SS over a period of two and a half years, being first imprisoned as criminals and then being transferred, separately to Auschwitz, and finally to Belsen. They were saved by their exceptional courage, determination and ingenuity, and by several improbable strokes of good luck -- the greatest of which was the fact that Anita played the cello.</p><p>Lasker-Wallfisch draws from her own startlingly vivid memories of her experience, and also incorporates the letters her family wrote to one another during this period as well as other primary documents.

Their lives stretch across a century and a half of explosive cultural and political transformations in Japan. These five artists-two actresses, two writers, and a painter-were noted for their talents, their beauty, and their love affairs rather than for any association with politics. But through the fearlessness of their art and their private lives, they influenced the attitudes of their times and challenged the status quo.</p>
<p>Phyllis Birnbaum presents her subjects from various perspectives, allowing them to shine forth in all of their contradictory brilliance: generous and petulant, daring and timid, prudent and foolish. There is Matsui Sumako, the actress who introduced Ibsen's Nora and Wilde's Salome to Japanese audiences but is best remembered for her ambition, obstreperous temperament and turbulent love life. We also meet Takamura Chieko, a promising but ultimately disappointed modernist painter whose descent into mental illness was immortalized in poetry by a husband who may well have been the source of her troubles. In a startling act of rebellion, the sensitive, aristocratic poet Yanagiwara Byakuren left her crude and powerful husband, eloped with her revolutionary lover, and published her request for a divorce in the newspapers. Uno Chiyo was a popular novelist who preferred to be remembered for the romantic wars she fought. Willful, shrewd, and ambitious, Uno struggled for sexual liberation and literary merit. Birnbaum concludes by exploring the life and career of Takamine Hideko, a Japanese film star who portrayed wholesome working-class heroines in hundreds of films, working with such directors as Naruse, Kinoshita, Ozu, and Kurosawa. Angry about a childhood spent working to provide for greedy relatives, Takamine nevertheless made peace with her troubled past and was rewarded for years of hard work with a brilliant career.</p>

We know her from the exquisite painted bust in the Berlin Museum, discovered in 1912, which has made her ancient Egypt's most recognizable queen and a symbol of her country's history. Until now, however, she has remained largely unknown and unrecognized for her contributions to Egyptian society. Wife of Akhenaten, the monotheistic pharaoh, adored by her family, blessed by the sun god, and worshiped by her people, Nefertiti suddenly and completely vanished from the record. Was she banished by her husband or raised to rule as his equal? Did she reign, under another name, in her own right? Could she have been the áminence grise behind the young Tutankhamen, her son-in-law?

In A Feminist I Christine Overall offers wide-ranging reflections from a first-person point of view on these issues, and on the politics of the modern university itself. In doing so she continually returns to underlying epistemological concerns. What are our assumptions about the ways in which knowledge is constructed? To what degree are our perceptions shaped by our social roles and identities? In the past generation feminists have led the way in recognising the importance of such questions, and recognising too the ways in which personal experience may be an invaluable reference point in academic theory and practice. But reliance on personal experience is fraught with problems; how is one to deal with tensions between the autobiographical and the analytic? This book points the way to resolving some of those tensions, and to fruitfully sustaining others. It is a book of considerable insight, warm humanity, and genuine importance.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.59083886216 Pounds, Width: 0.625 Inches",26.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/90/9781551112190.jpg,Success,110,22.6

William Murray was devoted to his mother, Natalia Danesi Murray, and to his mother's longtime lover, writer Janet Flanner. Even as a teenager, he accepted their unconventional relationship. His portrait of the two most important people in his life is unforgettable.</p>
<p>Janet Flanner was already celebrated as the author of a new style of personal journalism for her ""Letter from Paris: in <i>The New Yorker</i> when she met the Italian-born Natalia Murray on Fire Island, New York, in 1940. Their encounter, writes William Murray, was a ""<i>coup de foudre</i>, a thunderbolt that instantly sent them rushing into each other's arms and forever altered their lives, as well as mine.""</p>
<p>Murray was already growing up in two cultures on different continents, in New York and Rome, when his mother's life changed so dramatically. He quickly accepted Flanner and the unusual household in which he found himself. (Natalia's mother, Mammina Ester, also lived with them in New York.) His memories of the women and of his own boyhood and adolescence are touching and often hilarious.</p>
<p><i>Janet, My Mother, and Me</i> offers a look at the world in which gay professional women moved in the decades before such relationships became more open and accepted. Murray's mother was a publishing executive and a broadcaster, and Murray, who originally hoped to become an opera singer and trained for that profession, eventually moved into the professions of both his mother and Flanner, becoming a novelist and then for many years an editor and writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>.</p>
<p>This is an exuberant, warm, and often poignant memoir with a memorable cast of characters. Beguiling and unusual, it will remain vivid in readers' minds for years to come.<br>

Set against the backdrop of bloody Carthage, the novel celebrates one woman s attempt to transcend history.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Writing becomes weapon and refuge for the oppressed in this fiercely intelligent, intricate novel set in a tragic, bewitching Algeria. Expressing the bitterness of being caught between traditional Islamic and modern European cultures, married 36-year-old Isma begins her story the summer she has an affair with a student. A highly educated musicologist, Isma is also governed by Islamic tradition. When her husband, Leo, discovers her dalliance, he beats her, intending to blind her. The affair marks Isma's awakening and the beginning of her quest for true independence, though she stays with her husband for a little while longer. When she finally leaves him, she embarks on a semi-documentary film project, to be called Arable Women. Intertwining her experiences in the mountains filming peasant women with memories of her childhood and stories about her female ancestors and relatives, Isma weaves a complicated tapestry of images and sentiments. The tales she unearths are richly detailed and gracefully told, and the book becomes a moving common history of cultural exile and captivity. Djebar, winner of the 1996 Neustadt Prize for Contributions to World Literature, has a talent for narrating the stories of those who are freed and voiceless without heavy-handed moralizing or judgment.

The goddesses of Hinduism and Buddhism represent the largest extant collection of living goddesses anywhere on the planet. Feminists in the West often draw upon South Asian goddesses as theological resources in the contemporary rediscovery of the Goddess. Yet, these goddesses are products of a male supremacist society.<p> <p>What is the impact of powerful female deities--their images, projections, textuality, and history--on the social standing and psychological health of women? Do they empower women, or serve the interests of patriarchal culture? <b>Is the Goddess a Feminist?</b> looks at the goddesses of South Asia to address these questions directly.<p> <p>Not a book about a single goddess or even about a variety of South Asian goddesses, the volume raises questions about images of deities as symbols and the ways in which they function. Contributors discuss contemporary Indian women who have embraced goddesses as spiritually and socially liberating, as well as the seeming contradictions between the power of Indian goddesses and the lives of Indian women. They also explore such topics as the element of male desire in the embodiment of female deities, the question of who speaks for the goddesses, and the politics and theology of Western feminist use of Hindu and Buddhist goddesses as models for their feminist reflections.<p></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>American and Indian scholars of religion, anthropology, women's studies, and psychology look at the complex relationship between the living worship of female divinities and women in India. In keeping with the multiplicity, especially of Hinduism but also Buddhism and Jainism, the anthology presents a number of sometimes conflicting views rather than a consistent account.

<p>In Women in Science and Engineering: Choices for Success Cecily Cannan Selby and her co-authors identify ways in which women in science can adapt to existing institutional systems, and how these systems can and should improve so that women, and others with diverse backgrounds, will choose to work within them. Ultimately, the seek the benefits to all of a coeducational workforce that is governed, evaluated, and rewarded through coeducational values and attitudes.</p>
<p>The authors describe what progress has been made over the past twenty-five years. They explore questions of workplace rewards to determine what factors keep women in science and engineering. Turning to successes women have had in both the private sector and government, they ask which policies and practices have been proven to work and are worth emulating. And they discuss the role of women in the academic scientific community. In a conclusion, they address questions of what current progress means for the future of women in science and engineering.</p>

<p>Penny Colman is a widely published, award-winning author of books, essays, stories, and articles. She writes for all ages and covers a range of subjects. Colman's books have been named in the Best Books for Young Adults, Notable Books for Children, and Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers (American Library Association); Teacher's Choice and Young Adult Choice (International Reading Association); Best Children's Book of the Year (Bank Street College of Education); Notable Trade Book (Council for the Social Studies/Children's Book Council); and Orbis Pictus Honor Award for Outstanding Nonfiction ( National Council of Teachers of English.)

Her book, Rosie the Riveter: Working on the Home Front in World War II (Crown, 1995), was reviewed by the New York Times Book Review: ""Penny Colman's engaging book...enlivened and authenticated by quotations from women who talk about their wartime experiences.""

It also reveals the shifting requirements of a society which depends upon sustaining gender, class, and racial inequality under changing historical conditions.<p>Despite the fact that black and white ""unwed mothers"" in the pre-Roe v. Wade era experienced the same biological events, their lived experiences were very different. <b></b><b><i>Wake Up Little Susie</i></b> surveys the public policies, community attitudes, and private responses to illegitimate pregnancy, maternity, and children that structured these women's experiences. It demonstrates how female sexuality and fertility, and the single mother herself, have been used as proving grounds for theories of race, gender, motherhood, and social stability. Rickie Solinger provides the first published analyses of maternity home programs for unwed mothers from 1945 to 1965, as well as examines how nascent cultural and political constructs such as the ""population bomb"" and the ""sexual revolution"" reinforced racially-specific public policy initiatives. Such initiatives encouraged white women to relinquish their babies, spawning a flourishing adoption market, while they subjected black women to social welfare policies which assumed they would keep their babies and aimed to prevent them from having more.<p>Incorporating the responses of social service and political professionals of this era to the ""crisis"" of out-of-wedlock pregnancy with letters, poems, and statements from the pregnant women themselves, <b></b><b><i>Wake Up Little Susie</i></b> offers readers an arena to explore the intersections of female biology and social constructions of gender, race, and class.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>This book documents the ways in which race shaped the experience of unwed pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s. It analyzes the cultural meaning of unwed pregnancy for white and black women and emphasizes the added complications of race and class in the study of gender. Solinger is also author and editor of other books on abortion. Annotation c.

Thus begins Nora Okja Keller's breathtaking first novel, which follows Beccah, a young Korean-American girl growing up in Hawaii, as she uncovers the secret of her mother's past. Completely ignorant of her mother Akiko's history - she was sold into prostitution in the Japanese ""recreation camps"" of World War II for her oldest sister's dowry - Beccah understands that her mother lives in a spirit world she cannot share, and that clearly marks her as ""other."" Narrated in two voices, Beccah's and Akiko's, Keller reveals the story of Akiko's extraordinary dislocation - the slavery of the camps, the death of her first child, her unhappy marriage to an American missionary - which Beccah understands only after her mother's death. In language that is both harsh and lyrical, Keller explores the universally complicated relationship between mother and daughter. She shows us both Akiko's way of survival, sustained by her remarkable strength and her love for her daughter, and Beccah's acceptance of her mother and her own place in a world her mother no longer physically inhabits.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This impressive first novel by a Hawaii-based writer of mixed Korean and American ancestry depicts one of the atrocities of war and its lingering effects on a later generation. An intense study of a mother-daughter relationship, it dwells simultaneously in the world of spirits and the social milieu of the adolescent schoolgirl who later becomes a career woman with lovers. Beccah is a youngish, contemporary Hawaiian whose Korean mother, Akiko, was sold into prostitution as a young woman and sent to a ""recreation camp'' to service the occupying Japanese army. Akiko developed a resilience that allowed her to distance herself from the daily plundering of her body; she also developed an intense communication with the spirit world that helped her survive the horror of her experience-and helped her, too, to catch the attention of a visiting American missionary, who married her and fathered Beccah. After his death, mother and daughter live together in Honolulu, Beccah striving for a normal life, Akiko, often possessed, screaming and wailing, by her ghosts and visions. With the help of a flamboyant, ultra-worldly friend who calls herself Auntie Reno, Akiko becomes a seer and fortune-teller. Akiko's flashbacks to her haunted past and Beccah's account of their lives together are told alternately, and it is one of Keller's several triumphs that she is able to render the two worlds so powerfully and distinctly. Though piercing and moving in its evocation of feminine closeness, however, the narrative becomes somewhat claustrophobic, so that the occasional interventions of the cheerfully vulgar Auntie Reno are hugely welcome. A striking debut by a strongly gifted writer, nonetheless. Author tour.

Not unlike the false promise of ""having it all"" that women faced in the 1970s, this goal is nearly impossible to achieve. The pain of ""never getting it right"" can be felt across the nation. Others have described the malaise, but until now, no one has described this revolution or pointed to the light at the end of the tunnel. Journalist and feminist Suzanne Braun Levine, a founding editor of Ms. magazine, has interviewed scores of men and learned about the difficulties fathers face in parenting. Since men don't tend to use each other as sounding boards, Levine does it for them. Taking a lesson from the women's movement, she puts her finger on what makes it so hard for men to put family first. Readers will turn to Father Courage to discover what men are experiencing. At home, their parenting learning curve is steep, and moms don't want to give up the role of the General. The workplace is much less family-friendly to men, and the 24/7 life of corporate America takes its toll. Levine shows that fathers and mothers aren't crazy, but stressed, and she offers solutions that range from the commonsense to the revolutionary. This is a brilliant and bracing new look at what is right-and wrong-in American family life.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/22/9780151003822.jpg,Success,124,22.6

Even worse than wearing a fake kimono and obi is that she's living at home with her mother.

And when Alex, who seems to be getting very cozy with her mother, spills the secret that the renovation is in preparation for a visit from Pavarotti, Emily is thrown into a wonderfully familiar quandary: how to deal with a parent who might be losing it.</p><p> First-time novelist Anna Esaki-Smith has a wry, understated approach to the themes of assimilation, growing up, striking out on shaky ground, finding yourself - and loving your mother.

Wetherell, author of <i>One River More</i><P>Grover came to angling late and seems hell-bent on making up for lost time. But <i>Northern Waters</i> is more than just a fishing memoir. It's the chronicle of a woman profoundly and passionately engaged in the natural world. With intelligence, clarity, and considerable literary skill, Grover reminds us that the world is richer than we supposed, more complex, more fertile, more surprising&#151;and that it's time we rolled up our sleeves and got down to the messy business of being alive.&#151;Jerry Dennis, author of <i>The River Home</i><P><i>Northern Waters</i> is my favorite kind of fishing book&#58; part memoir, part history, and all engaging commentary on what makes fishermen the way we are. It is also a splendid celebration of the north woods and their often imperiled magic.&#151;Paul Schullery, author of <i>Royal Coachman</i><P>Many of us have, as Jan Zita Grover writes, submitted ourselves 'to the tutelage of waters.'

She is also the author of <i>North Enough&#58; AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts</i>.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Though ostensibly about fly-fishing, this book never talks about catching fish; it is instead a detailed examination of the Midwest--written by a native Californian. Although not a spectacular writer, Grover (North Enough: AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts) does have a keen eye for nature and our impact on the environment. (The waters Grover writes about--in the north woods of Minnesota and Wisconsin--have been familiar to me for 25 years, but she surprised me with her observations.) These challenging essays primarily explore an angler's engagement with the natural world, but they also take on Great Lakes salmon stocking, lampreys, dams, and fishing in Montana (which Midwestern anglers regard as our reward for surviving our winters). Many fly-fishing converts have been driven to write about the sport; few have succeeded as well as Grover. Although there are a few glaring factual errors, this is for the most part a thought-provoking work.

Drawing on original research into women's participation in the work force, the author shows how the Islamization of state and society which followed the 1979 revolution involved an attempt by the Islamic state to seclude women within the home. Its power to transform gender relations, however, was constrained by many factors--the Iran-Iraq war, economic restructuring, and women's varied responses to oppression. In 1999, women's participation in the labor force is greater than it was before the revolution, and gender consciousness is at a higher level than at the height of westernization in the 1960s and 70s.<br>",en,,"Height: 7.8200631 Inches, Length: 5.1999896 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",32,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/27/9781856496827.jpg,Success,99,22.6

And what kind of life can a woman lead when she knows she is being followed, obsessively and perhaps dangerously, by one?</b></p>
<p>This is the dilemma facing Theresa Bedell, a reporter in New York, in Rebecca Gilman's tensely fascinating new play. When Theresa goes on an awkward blind date with a friend of a friend, she sees no reason to continue the relationship—but the man, an attractive fellow named Tony, thinks otherwise. While Theresa is at first annoyed yet flattered by his continuing attention, her attitude gradually changes to one of fear and fury when he starts violently to menace her and those around her.</p>
<p>In brilliantly delineating the kind of terror a woman in full control of her life feels when everything around her suddenly seems to be a threat, Gilman probes the dark side of relationships in the 1990s with the rich insight and compelling characterizations that have distinguished her earlier plays and made her one of the most exciting young playwrights working today.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches",15,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/39/9780571199839.jpg,Success,123,22.6

To most, bohemia is gone—erased by the lifestyle of the 1990s and the too many, too fast influences of modern living.</p>
<p>Ann Powers, an acclaimed pop critic for <i>The New York Times</i> and one of today's most notable authorities on alternative culture, claims in this powerful and personal chronicle that bohemia is alive and well in America—nurturing new lifestyles and defining our tastes in art, politics, sexual mores, and all matters cultural. <i>Weird Like Us</i> sets the record straight on alternative America—a new bohemia whose dynamic citizens are re-creating traditional modes of building families, falling in love, having sex, and making careers, reinventing our shared values from the ground up.</p>
<p>So how different are these bohemians? Through stories from her own life and those of her fellow alternative Americans—artists, writers, entrepreneurs, feminists, cyberoutlaws, punk rockers, politicos, and queers—Powers traces the evolution of this world and where it has gone. The observations and attitudes that fill these pages will touch many who long for this lifestyle, and will shock others. No longer confined to coffee shops in North Beach or Greenwich Village, bohemia is thriving from coast to coast.</p>
<p>In this wonderfully written memoir, Ann Powers writes of an alternatie culture that has never before been fully presented—one that takes into account the real politics, real feelings, and genuine creativity of those who transofrmed the dying counterculture of the sixties into a mode of artistic and spiritual survival in the nineties. In doing so, she has written a vibrant, engrossing take on a culture and its people.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/83/9780684838083.jpg,Success,137,22.6

For some, feminism is the favorite scapegoat for multiple social ills; for others, the greatest success story of the closing century. The Janus face of feminism in the media reflects the competing images of women's lives today. Feminists themselves hold sharply opposing views on the success or failures of three decades of women's activism. <i>Why Feminism?</i> looks at the shifts in feminist thinking from the brash emergence of Women's Liberation at the close of the 1960s to the diverse and discordant feminisms of recent decades. Exploring feminism's troubled relations with psychology and psychoanalysis, the rise of new evolutionary theory, the impact of queer theorizing on gender categories, controversies over memory and trauma, and increasing anxieties about men and masculinity, <i>Why Feminism?</i> illustrates the continuing provocation and significance of feminist inquiry, laying out potentialities and pitfalls for the century ahead.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>",en,0,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",26,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/58/9780231119658.jpg,Success,110,22.6

<p>Thinking about the body has become highly fashionable, but the renew focus, while certainly welcome, seems to always end at the body's surface. Recent sociological and feminist theory has made important claims about the prowess of cultural inscription on the body, and about the cultural representation of the body, but the body that appears in this new theory seems to be, ironically, disembodied. If this newly theorized body has interioriy, it is one that is explained predominantly through psychoanalysis. The physiological processes inside the body remain a mystery to be explained, if at all, only in the esoteric language of biomedicine.</p>
<p>As a trained biologist, Lynda Birke was frustrated by the gap between feminist cultural analysis and her won scientific background. In this book, she seeks to bridge the this gap by looking ""inside"" the body, using ideas in anatomy and physiology to develop the feminist view that the biological body is socially and culturally constructed. Birke rejects the assumption that the body's functioning is somehow fixed and unchanging, claiming that biological science offers more than just a deterministic narrative of how nature works. <i>Feminism and the Biological Body</i> puts biological science and feminist theory together and suggests that we need a new politics that includes , rather than denies, our bodily flesh.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",28.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/36/9780813528236.jpg,Success,113,22.6

<p>Gary was up, dressed, sitting across the room sipping coffee and smoking a cigarillo. He'd been out: the Sunday <i>Times</i> sat unopened on a nearby chair.</p>
<p>""It's almost twelve now. A cab will take at least fifteen minutes. If we can find one. Go shower. You know you take forever in there.""</p>
<p>Behind Gary's head, sunlight came in through the skylighted dressing room and pushed through the flecked fibers of the shoji-screen. Spence could see the gold flecking on the rice paper very clearly today. The undulating fields of lacquered flowers were backlighted—bright as persimmons—Gary's face was in shadow.</p>
<p>""I want you to know beforehand that this brunch is extremely important to me. Arnie has invited Seitelman, the Oriental Art expert. I've been trying to get near him for months. I want him to come look at those <i>Monoyamo</i> scrolls I picked up last month.""</p>
<p>Gary exhaled blue smoke. It floated into the sunlight, turned grey then yellow then grey again. He exhaled again and a second cloud rose to meet the first in a billow. It spread thinly, forming a tiny tornado around the head of the smiling Shinto statue precariously perched on a wall shelf. The Shinto idol kept smiling; it never seemed to notice the smoke descend again and form a flat halo directly over Gary's head. Spence noticed though. He laughed.</p>
<p>""I'm not kidding, Spence. Arnie's gone to a lot of trouble to get Seitelman. And it will take a lot of tact to keep him there. So I don't want any interference from you. Is that clear?""</p>
<p>Gary exhaledforcefully and broke the halo. He began picking at the edge of the cup he was drinking from as though it were crusted with something. It was his favorite china—from the Northern Sung—and invaluable. Spence never touched it. He only used china that could be dropped: or thrown. Gary frowned. Spence turned over in bed.</p>
<p>""As soon as you've met him, go to the other end of the room or table or wherever we are. And stay there. And, Spence, do try to keep your pin-sized knowledge of art to yourself.

In The Free Thinkers: Two Novellas, she gives these lost lives a new voice, recovering in exacting detail the world of newly arrived Eastern European Jews in turn-of-the-century-America. Silbert's stories chronicle their arrival in Chicago and New York, and follow them as they trade Yiddish and Russian for English, find work in factories and Jewish newspapers, attend Zionist meetings, and struggle toward the promise of freedom and happiness.<br>
The Free Thinkers tells two tales. The first novella focuses on Ida, an independent woman, a ""freethinker"" devoted to finding her own way in America. A factory forelady, a patron of the theater, and an instinctive feminist, she is determined to find total freedom in a man's world-no matter where it leads her.<br>
The collection's other novella chronicles the lives of three sisters from the Ukraine as they find husbands and start their own families in America. Two masterful chapters at the heart of the novella describe their mother's arrival, after the great war and the revolution, to a small Indiana town. She is ""a vision, in her clothes, her posture, the very air around her, a vision of a sight on a street in the village they'd all come from, suddenly seamlessly transported into this pleasant spring morning to the very middle of America.""<br>
In Layle Silbert's tender Stories of the New World, as in the best stories of Chekov, the slightest gesture carries with it the weight of the world. Nothing happens, everything happens.

<p>In her stunning first novel, <b>Amy and Isabelle</b>, Elizabeth Strout evokes a teenager's alienation from her distant mother—and a parent's rage at the discovery of her daughter's sexual secrets. In most ways, Isabelle and Amy are like any mother and her 16-year-old daughter, a fierce mix of love and loathing exchanged in their every glance. And eating, sleeping, and working side by side in the gossip-ridden mill town of Shirley Falls doesn't help matters. But when Amy is discovered behind the steamed-up windows of a car with her math teacher, the vast and icy distance between mother and daughter becomes unbridgeable.</p>
<p>As news of the scandal reaches every ear, it is Isabelle who suffers from the harsh judgment of Shirley Falls, intensifying her shame about her own secret past. And as Amy seeks comfort elsewhere, she discovers the fragility of human happiness through other dramas, from the horror of a missing child to the trials of Fat Bev, the community peacemaker. Witty and often profound, <b>Amy and Isabelle</b> confirms Elizabeth Strout as a powerful new talent.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches",16,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/99/9780375705199.jpg,Success,134,22.6

<p>She couldn't sleep. She couldn't stop trembling with anxiety. And she worried that she would throw her precious baby boy down the stairs if she continued to lose her mind. That is how Postpartum Depression tore apart Susan Kushner Resnick's world. And she had no idea that thousands of other new mothers were experiencing the same agony.</p>
<p>While she struggled to take care of her two children, Resnick searched for a book by a survivor of Postpartum Depression, something that would show her in black and white that she could survive the worst period in her life. But no such book existed. So, when she finally conquered her demons, she wrote one.</p>
<p>Sleepless Days is a brilliantly written, haunting memoir of her encounter with Postpartum Depression. It is a story for the other 400,000 women who are afflicted with PPD each year and are desperate for reassurances that others have felt their despair and recovered. It is a compelling narrative for anyone who has ever watched helplessly as a vulnerable woman fought against the weight of this mysterious disease.</p>
<p>Resnick's symptoms begin with the onslaught of insomnia, anxiety attacks, and a general apathy toward her newborn son. She loses weight and gains moodswings. She suffers from an ongoing tension that no glass of wine can cut through. She listlessly stumbles through each day like a zombie. And because an entire summer feels like one long night, she comes to think of her existence as a series of sleepless days with the same fogginess and hypersensitivity, the same sense of disorientation and loneliness one feels when gazing out a window at streetlights and moonshine in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Feelings of isolation sear through every page of Sleepless Days. Resnick recounts the hours spent watching the television screen-wishing the people from the TV could smash through the screen and come sit with her. And she compares her battle with insomnia to a menacing soldier standing guard over her, threatening her with images of what could happen to her child if she dares to allow herself a peaceful night's rest. Her journey finally takes us into her world of therapy, which leads to her heartbreaking decision to forgo breastfeeding in order to begin taking antidepressants.</p>
<p>Through Resnick's devastating account shines a ray of hope. She develops an extraordinary friendship with a Holocaust survivor. She learns to lean on friends. And she accepts the lack of control that defines her life. Her own rebirth is juxtaposed with the arrival of Autumn. She poignantly writes, The trees on this street are starting to look as if a child dipped her fingers into red and yellow fingerpaints and smeared them over the green parts. They are dying a beautiful death. And she is coming back to life.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.68 Inches, Length: 5.58 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 0.885 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/63/9780312253363.jpg,Success,137,22.6

Taken over the course of a year, at bookstore signings, on stage, and at home, Courtney-Clarke's photographs both celebrate and illuminate one of the great figures of our time."" ""Supporting the visual story are thoughts on Angelou's powers of friendship as interpreted by her friends, in chapters that highlight the poet's virtues - Joy, Giving, Learning, Perseverance, Creativity, Courage, Self-Respect, Spirituality, Love, and Taking Risks. Among those represented here, all of whom count Dr. Angelou as one of the most important persons in their lives, are leaders Coretts Scott King, Reverend Barbara King, and Andrew Young; singers Ashford and Simpson; and Dr. Angelou's son, the writer Guy Johnson. And in her touching foreword, Oprah Winfrey describes how Dr. Angelou came to be her ""counsel, consultant, advisor, shoulder to cry on, Rock, Shield, Protector, Defender, Mama Bear, and Mother-Sister-Friend.""",en,First Edition,"Height: 7.24 Inches, Length: 7.37 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches",22.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/88/9780609604588.jpg,Success,131,22.6
