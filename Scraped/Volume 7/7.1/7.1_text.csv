3,"NOTES FROM THE DESK TOP
Lots of changes.
Lots of changes.
In May, I resigned from my job at Old Wives Tales bookstore, nearly seven yeara
after starting the store. My decision followed four montha of frustrating and pain-
ful collective mediations. The four of us who remained had reached an impasse.
The only directions left open were arbitration and/or court.
Considering as many aspects of the situation as I could see clearly, I didn't
see that the store could make it financially through cantinued strife. TI didn't
want to watch this community go through another public bookstore war. And--bottom
line--I couldn't see myself going through those battles with the psychic toll they
take and coming out on the other side with enough energy and resilience to get the
bookstore back on her feet and into a healthy place again. The four months of
mediations had more than convinced me that there would be no success in any version
of the four of us continuing to try to work together. Nor could I get any picture
of 'the opposition' leaving any way short of court order. And s0, leaning on what
I had learned ten years earlier riding the infamous trains of India--""If you don't
find yourself at the destination you had in mind, you'll end-up somewhere else, and it
will be an interesting and fascinating place.""--I resigned. Pell resigned at the
same time.
In the months since, Pell, who ran a women-oriented craft store in New England
(Vibrations--New Bedford, Mass) from 1968-1976, has opened a new store--WomanCrafts
West--on Valencia Street. If you know craftswomen looking for a place to sell their
work, tell them to contact her at WomanCrafts West, 1007% Valencia Street, San
Francisco, 940110. It is an elegant and beautiful store, featuring very fine work
from women around the country.
I've spent the summer re-imagining my work. After being quite up in the air,
thinking about applying for work in other stores, wondering how to next focus this
passion of mine to create, promote, and distribute a feminist literature, and even
wondering if I might want to pursue something else entirely,I've come to a fairly
clear vision of wanting to keep publishing FBN, to engage myself in learning the
skills of magazine editing, to expand it's framework to make it a more useful tool
for the women-in-print movement, and to expand it's readership to include bookstores
that care deeply about having a good feminist and/or lesbian section as well as con-
tinuing to serve feminist bookstores. TI continue to see FBN focused on feminist
bookstores. (I do see the world through bookstore-colored glasses.) And I see this

4,"as an appropriate focus for a women-in-print centered magazine; the bookstores are
heart-centers in their communities as well as being the central places where the
women-in-print energy comes together and goes out into the world. In my wildest
imaginings I think of creating an over-the-counter for-public-consumption magazine
for feminist bibliophiles---but that's next year's fantasy. One reality at a time
is what T can reasonablu expect to pull toaether.
I've also been imagining what it would be like to do FBN as the primary focus of
my work instead of doing it after store hours in my 'spare' time. Maybe it's time in
my life to try doing one thing well. Working on FBN this issue I've been able to
take time to actually answer correspondence, to write for more information, for order-
ing terms, for details, I've been able to take time to read some of the books I annotate.
As well as to pursue and finish the articles that appear in this issue. I'm finding
that I like being able to do a more thorough job. I'm even dreaming of a computer to
keep track of the mailing lists, do word processing, (typesetting?). They even come
with a dictionary program that would reduce my typos by about 90%.
Financially, it all seems possible. The work I did at ABA pursuing ads is paying
off. If FBN doubles it's subscription list, I'll be able to pay myself a reasonable
wage for 20 hours a week. If FBN tripled its subscriptions...well, being attached to
reality I'm applying for part time Ors At the moment I've an application out for a
parttime driver/courier job that pays $l0/hour and has 'jump-seat' free flights as a
benefit. Send me energy for it if you believe in that sort of thing. I'd also like
to do some consulting for bookstores and use this store of knowledge I've accumulated
in that way.
Part of what I've been doing this summer and will continue to do this fall is

want it? create a mail-order catalogue that stores could send out to their own
customers? Do consulting for stores? … For publishers that want to increase their
distribution? Become a publicist for feminist books? Organize a national Women-In-
Print conference? Not to mention settling into my own writing...(Maybe I don't have
time for that part-time job. Now if I could quadruple FBN's subscriptions.... Oh!
It feels good to be able to dream again!)
This is the last issue of the subscription year, so look forward to getting a
renewal form/invoice in the mail about two weeks after this issue arrives. Please
pay it promptly as FBN is broke on its wazoo and needs money to pay for the printing
of the next issue and to pay back the loan that made printing this issue possible.
Enclosed in the envelope will be a questionaire for feedback re: all these ideas and
changes, and a financial survey that several stores have asked for. I think it would
give all of us a boost to know how strong we actually are.
I especially want to thank all the women who shared their dreams and visions with
me in long phone calls, and in conversations at ABA, NWSA, Women and Words,and COSMEP
and in so doing, helped me to rebuild mine.
Continuingly,
Carol Seajay
PS If you're coming to San Francisco, give me a call. I'm almost always up
for a good bookstore or feminist publishing chat. 415-431-2093. It's in the
phone book.
PPS I got the job (Hooray! Wish you'd been here for the party.) TI got it and
started work just a couple days after typing the above: then dove into the four
week 45-50 hour/week training program which slowed FBN production to a dead stop.
Now (6 weeks later) the job is settling down to part time, FBN is almost off to
the press. HOPEFULLY you will receive this September issue while it is still
October. Apologies to all to whom the delay has mattered. Look for the November
issue in early December. Deadline for it will be November 20th.

5,"LETTERS To Us/From Us
July, 17, 1983
Dear Carol and FBN,
I have noticed that there is a new edition of Gaia's Guide available at most
feminist bookstores in the northeast. Seeing an '84 edition surprised me, because
I was aware throughout 1982-3 that the publication was involved in litagation with
the printer and typesetter for non-payment for services provided in producing the
1982 Guide. (Nor has the binder or anyone else involved in the actual production
of the guide, right down to the shipper and distributor been paid.) The publisher,
Sandy Horn, was in debt to the tune of $20,000, and made no response to the regular
requests for remittance, until UP Press, (Palo Alto, Ca.) the printer, started liti-
gation in the fall of 1981. The story dragged on until May of 1983, when Sandy Horn
settled out of court with the printers alone for about 3/4 of the actual printing
costs, 1/4 of that sum then had to be paid out in lawyers fees.
An unfortuanate situation, that apparently received little attention over the
year and a half the issue was argued across the ocean with Sandy Horn, who now lives
in London.
I do not support Sandy Horn's profiting from the expenditure of other women's
time, energy, and work. The Guide is immensely popular for obvious reasons. But I
encourage the boycott of Gaia's Guide, and suggest that women make an effort to
accumulate the information therein in other publications, for the benefit of the
women's community and not for the profiteering of one, :
If you wish futher information in this regard, please contact me and I will
refer you to those who were directly involved.
Thank you,
Penny Pollard

Dear Women
As a former member of the Fan The Flames Bookstore in Columbus, Ohio, I always
had access to FBN. Now, having moved to the forsaken hills of Worcester, Massachu-
setts, I am faced with a deep sense of isolation--the closest bookstore really is an
hour away. But more than that, I find the void of no longer working with a store,
knowing what's available and how to get it, is far greater than I imagined. I would
like to continue receiving the newsletter as an individual. Is this possible? I am
also a poor individual. Do you have a sliding scale? Please do let me know.
Best wishes,
Yvonne Lutter
Ed. 's Note: Yes, ex-bookstore workers can subscribe to FRN. Many have done so
in the past for exactly that sense of withdrawal /isolation. FBN does do a sliding

''On March 1, 1983, Irina Ratushinskaya a twenty-eight-year-old writer in the USSR,

have distributed her verse in typescript to other writers.
Her sentence: seven years in prison, five years internal exile.
As writers and teachers, we view the treatment of our Soviet colleague as an
infringement of her basic human rights. We protest the arrest, conviction, and sentenc-

and to secure her immediate release.
We urge readers to express their concern by writing to Ambassador M. A. Dobrynin, |

11,"PERSEPHONE PRESS CLOSES
The closing of Persephone Press came as a horrible, terrible shock to most of
the bookstores.
Part of what is so horrible is the immense loss of the work they were doing,
part of it is the suddeness with which it seemed to happen, and part of it is that
they seemed to be doing so well: their books were our best-sellers. How could they
have closed down--due to finances?--with successes like that? It has been one of
those shocks that make a woman do a double-take, make one look again at what she
presumes to be solid. It has been deeply unsettling in that way. Persephone Press'
closing has been a loss that is matched only by the closing of Diana Press or of
Women In Distribution. Or by the closing of the only women's bookstore for miles
around. It is immense.
Persephone closed in May. Some of the dust is settling. Distribution of the
titles that are still in print has been worked out. (See opposite page). Most of
the titles that are out of stock are now settled with new publishers and are being
reprinted or will be yet this fall. The books that were '""forthcoming' seem to be
finding publishers as well. A little more time seems to be what is needed to work

For all that has been hard this summer, finding the books still in print, being -…
out of titles that are out of stock, tracking the books as they move to new publish-
ers, the larger loss is the loss of the vision that empowered Persephone. Their
ability to conceive of books that didn't yet exist and to recognize the importance
Oof a book that existed only in proposal form, or only in someone's head. The books
they conceived of and the books they empowered into print: especially Nice Jewish
Girls, This Bridge, Claiming an Identity, and Feminist Tarot each expanded and
reshaped the vision and consicousness of the feminist and lesbian-feminist community.
Again. And again. And again. Their books raised issues, revealed racism, anti-
Semitism, and at their best, gave postitive images were there were precious few
before. Part of the loss is the loss of what Persephone might have brought into
publication in the future and now won't. What they did publish will continue to
affect and influence our community for years to come.
In these terms, Persephone Press was enormously successful. They were also

Until the August 8 issue of Gay Community News, there was no word from Persephone as
to what happened. And.even that article seems very sketchy and inadequate. In the
meantime, at ABA, NWSA. and wherever women-of-print gathered, there was a goodly
amount of guessing, of theorizing, and rumoring in attempt to grasp and understand
what had happened.and how it could have happened. In effort to help stores not on
the grapevine have access to the sense-making aspect the talk, I am listing here
some of the theorizing that I've heard. I doubt that any of it is The Truth. Likely
there will never be an ultimate explanation, a whole and complete understanding.
But, in the meantime, we need to learn from our collective experience, to not repeat
the same mistakes again and again. And also to remember that Persephone did what
once seemed to be impossible. Even if they ""failed"", let's also remember their
SUCCess.
Rumors, theories and guesses:

ANALYSIS OF CASH FORECASTING
In brief, if your open to buy is
bigger than your replacement cost and
you're spending that on stock, you're
in the black and growing. If it is
smaller, you're operating in the red
and are heading for trouble, if you aren't
there already.
This varies just a little by season
and special occasion, i.e. in October
or November what you spend on books will
probably be bigger than your October/
November open to buy because you are
laying in stock for Christmas sales.
If you did it perfectly, your December
income pays off the remaining bills

WOMEN AND DRUG/
ALCOHOL ABUSE
EVER GET THE FEELING SOMEBODY WANTS
US POOR, IGNORANT AND DRUNK 1!
If you don't already have a section on women and drug/alcohol abuse, you might want
to start one. Methinks this will be one of the major issues of the next couple
years in our communities. There are a number of good books available from small and
mainstream presses. Women's presses are just beginning to attend to te
need for women-centered, women-identified books.

problem in your community, keep these facts in mind: That alcoholism affects just ,
as many women as men--it's just that treatment programs for women don't get funded

the skid row stereotypes. That 30% of lesbian women will identify a drinking prob-
lem in themselves at some point in their lives. That every alcoholic affects the
lives of 4 or 5 other people. That these figures don't include women addicted to
or abusing street and prescription drugs. That co-alcoholism (enabling) is as dan-
gerous a disease as alcoholism. And that people who grew up in alcoholic homes are
increasingly looking to see how the family/relationship models learned there are
affecting their adult relationships.

42,"WOMEN In this exciting, controversial book, Ann
Kaplan, Assistant Professor of English and
Film at Rutgers, takes a hard look at the
portrayal and productions of women in the
Hollywood film industry over a 50-year
period.
She begins with a discussion of recent
developments in feminist film theory, and
BOTH SIDES OF shows how women have been reduced
to silence, absence and marginality by the
THE CAMERA recurring patterns in which they have
been portrayed, and finally, she talks about
women filmmakers’ attempts to find a
female voice and significant forms of ex-
E. Ann Kaplan
pression in the art of filmmaking.
Filled with photographs from both
past and contemporary films, the book
also contains useful bibliographies and
filmographies.

49,"Hi there,
Here at long last is the sample copy of FBN that you requested
at NWSA, at the Canadian Women and Words Conference, in response to
the OFF OUR BACKS article or one of several other articles, or in
response to something else entirely.
We were a bit overwhelmed by the number of requests we received
for sample copies. The requests totaled more than three times our
normal print řun, so it's taken a while to finance and print all these
extra copies and to get them ready for mailing. But here they are!
At last! Enjoy!
We're assuming than many of you requested sample copies because
you are interested in subscribing to FBN. Although FBN is oriented
to feminist bookstore workers, it is considered essential reading by
many librarians, women's studies teachers, students, writers, women-in-
print affectionados and hard-core bibliophiles. It keeps you in touch
with what's going on in the feminist bookworld and its the most complete
listing of new feminist and small press books and magazines that exists.
—It's the next best thing to having a feminist bookstore in your living
room.
Sending out these sample copies is part of an experiment to seg
ii and how FBN is useful to women outside feminist bookstores. If you'd
like to subscribe or not, we'd like to hear from you about how this
sort of magazine is or isn' t useful to you, and/or what would make it
(more) useful to you. And if you'd like to subscribe, there's a handy
subscription form below.
Thanks for your- feedback!
Yours in Spreading the words,
