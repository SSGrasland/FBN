published by the feminist press are listed in FBN only when FBN hears about
them, so DO remember to send announcements. Pre-publication announcements
facilitate early orders, All publishers should include bookstore terms,
Please also include distributors who (will) carry the title for the benefit, of
small stores that order primarily from distributors. If you prefer that
bookstores order directly from you, please include that information as well.
FBN welcomes letters, articles, announcements and trivia from publishers as
well as bookstores. We are the left and right hands of the same goal.

Most dear Ms. Seajay:

note, of course, that the club is underselling bookstores AND that it isn't
charging any shipping costs. More annoying, however, is that ever since this
fool ad came out, we have received many eager phone calls asking ""Have you
got Amateur Sity yet?"" When I say, ""No, it's not due until Fall,"" I get
Skeptical ""oh's"" in return. We haven't received announcement of it yet even.
The question that enters my suspicious little mind is, ""Perhaps the book club

Dear Carol,
There is a comment in the latest issue of FEMINIST BOOKSTORE NEWS that
should strike terror into the hearts of any publisher hoping to stay in
business... Without identifying the publisher there is a comment indicating
that ""some"" publisher is no longer adamant about the stores buying direct...
do nof who the publisher is referred to there, bút I am sure of
one thing, it's one that doesn't intend to around in 12 months.
Feminist bookstores account for about 25% of our business and we can

Now, to a subject near and dear to my heart. The book club, These are
the direct results we can expect from the club IF it flourishes. Towards this
enHd I EhavRe beEen wo rkiings m y awlreadyh ovyerw:orked self to death.
l. The book Club is well financed and is able to do the kind of advertising
in gay, straight, Lesbian, feminist, mixed, you name it media in a way that no
pub isher in the field has ever been able to dream of doing.

remain closeted and insular as they are today, but about 5% of them will
probably ""take the bait"" and become curious, write to the various and sundry |
movement publishers, get on mailing liśts... creep out of the darkness into |
the light and find us all...find their store,..find the mailing lists, take
t.
B: The $$$$ that pour into gay, Lesbian, feminist, women's, you name it,
movęment periodicals will obviously benefit them.
s e publietty ,‚ rather than hyrtlug bookstore sales will make the books `
outsell themselves. PROBABLY y the time you read this, it will have

about their future...that is IMPORTANT. The women's movement needs to be able
to COMPETE (that ugly word) with the trade publishers because otherwise our
""hot"" authors wil] continue to go to trade presses who do NOT know how to
romote them and therefore use them and lose them. And if you just take a
rob leam ,t.,here are some outrageous examples right now of that specific
. And finally, this is reaching a bit, but I am almost certain it will help,
The bookclub is picking up some trade hardbacks and discounting them and

resolution of that struggle, and what's happenin now at A Woman's Place.
irst of all, please know that our name ís still A Woman's Plaçe! We
formed a nOn pot mutual benefits corporation which owns A Woman's Place,
and someone already had that name as a California corporation, so we took the
name Women and Children First o: our corporate name. 1 However, we will still

form of non-profit mutual benefits corporation because we wanted to include

glad to have an ôōffiċcial form of organization which reflects our reality,
which of course was part of our problem in our previous struggle.
We've also just incorporated a non-profit tax-exempt corporation called
Woman and Children Too, with which we'll çarry out some of the non-income

Finally, let me me make a brief summary of what went wrong with this
previous collective, in hopes that it can be helpful to FBN readers. This is
deflitely my personal rendering of what it was really all about, and is not
necessarily shared by other Syueotiye members.

the first 12 years had no stated politics and beliefs. We had pu under
