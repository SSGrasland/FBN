different ways. RGIS charges about $20 per worker hour to

pm. Suggested Donation is two dollars.
During the day, the anniversary will be celebrated at

Throughout its first decade, Everywoman's Books has
been run by a volunteer collective of approximately 20
women who share in operation and staffing. As a feminist
bookstore, Everywoman's provides books by, for, and about
women, in promotion of choices and enhanced roles in
society. Best-selling categories are health, fiction,
abuse of women and children, sexuality, spirituality,
sociology and politics. The large bulletin board is an
important community resource regarding women's events and
services. The store also sells.non-sexist books for
children and teens, and maintains a small lending library.
The February 16 celebration is open to everyone.
