Also in this issue: ""If It Makes You Feel
Comfortable, Look Twice"", an article/letter by Susanna
Sturgis taking issue with an article in GCN
criticizing feminist bookstores for not selling (more)
of the (s/m) sex magazines. Hopefully GCN will run it
as well, but I publish it here as part of an ongoing
discussion and validation of the processes of feminist
bookstore workers in making these decisions as well as
ongoing discussion of the great sex-magazines/sex-
issues debate. I wish I had a report on the Selling
Sex Books workshop at WIP. The verbal reports I heard
were that most of the stores had carefully considered
positions on what they did and didn't sell. That
stores that didn't sell the sex magazines (or that
sold some but not others) made subscription and/or
sample copy information available on request. What was
remarkable was the degree of respect present for one
another's differing positions, a respect seemingly
lacking in the criticism feminist bookstores are
receiving for not carrying every magazine....
I find it ironic that none of the magazines in

Dear Etditor:
Sincerely,
The unfortunate tendency of the lesbian/feminist
community to view issues in terms of absolutes has M9ry «Gabriel
surfaced yet again in the controversy surrounding
publisher Barbara Grier's decision to sell serial
rights of Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence to Forum.
It is frightening that the outcry against Ms.
Grier's action caused her, however briefly, to
consider retiring. Does anyone really think that a
woman who as fought for 32 years to support, nurture
and sustain lesbian literature would sacrifice a
lifetime commitment for $2,000?
Although Forum is owned by Penthouse, they are
not interchangeable; Forum has a history of supporting
lesbian and feminist causes (whether we want that
support is another issue). Ms. Grier has stated that
her ""number one goal is the dissemination of material
about lesbians to lesbians."" This has to include the
women whose subscriptions to Ms. and occasional peeks
at Forum are the closest they've come to stepping out
of the closet.
Was Ms. Grier's action appropriate? I leave that
decision to those who are better than I at judging
others. What makes me uneasy is the sense of deja vu I
get from all the rhetoric about ""good taste"" and
""right to privacy"" and ""offensive material"": the same
phrases are being used by the Catholic Church in its More Missing Pieces

to chat up that buyer in the first place. She saw
combination of the two. She had a rap on how to clearly the balancing acts of a feminist publisher:
the need to make a book understandable to more than
chains: know you the ""converted""; the recognition that blithe disregard
for things financial wouldn't, in the long run, serve
our movement well; the fact that volunteer work, a
cornerstone of our trade, was often monotonous and we
had to spread the creative tasks around.
She had a wonderful sense of humour, noting on
occasion that the economic status of feminism would be
greatly enhanced if we declared ourselves a religion.
Pat came to Press Gang in its early days and
worked in the collective for over 10 years. She had
an amazing range of talents and an amazing distinctive
way of doing things. As a printer, graphic designer,
writer, editor and general cheerleader for the Press
she was an inspiration to many. As a collective
member Pat was both incorrigible and faithful, being
hopelessly late for a meeting one day and working past
midnight the next. She reveled in a good fierce
debate and could make you mad and make you think at
the same time (or shortly afterwards).
Pat's political commitments were far-reaching.
She helped found the Vancouver Women's Bookstore,
fought for lesbian rights in feminist groups and was
active with the Chilean resistance movement. And she
knew how to have a good time. Pat was thoroughly
versed in motorcycles and gardening and was renowned
as a source of unusual information and very funny
stories.
When Pat died, some of the women in her life
organized a memorial gathering that was attended by
over 300 people. It was an extraordinary event. We
told stories and cried and sang some of Pat's
favourite songs and mourned our loss. We're still
doing it. Pat was a rare woman; she made our lives
and our endeavours more interesting and worthy.
