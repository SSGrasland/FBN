Our closure is due to a number of
factors, primarily financial. Over the
years we've been committed to serving a
community that's been hardest hit by
Reaganomics. That directly affects us. As
a grassroots organization, we've never
had any capital or surplus to work with.
Our equipment needs upgrading in order to
maintain quality and cost efficiency. In
addition, due to burnout, several of our

and it has been difficult finding
replacements.

Hope this letter finds you well.
Here's our new catalog and notice of our
new address. We have incredible new of-
fice spaces overlooking Puget Sound and
the Olympic mountains. The story of the
various moves is too complicated to go
into; it all had to do with the city and
its bus tunnel. Suffice it to say that
with the help of our lawyers, Real Comet
Press and Seal were compensated. And this
new place is truly soul-inspiring. (Ex-
cept now our furniture looks even, more
dreadful). We all have our own offices, a
warehouse, shipping area, kitchen, compu-
ter room production room library confer-
ence room promo room....and Real Comet
has their own offices too....
Other changes are that Ruth Gundle
(Eighth Mountain Press) has come to work
for us two days a week from Portland and
Evelyn White is starting to read and edit
manuscripts for us by women of color. All
in all (as they told us never to end in
elementary composition), it looks like
1987 is going to be a good year.
