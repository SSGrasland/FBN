The bookstore, privately owned since its
founding in 1979, has been reorganized as a
cooperative "to give people a way to support the

The cooperative has issued 500 shares. To
date, 100 shares have been sold for $!00 each.
Two former owners of the store each retained 100
shares, leaving 200 yet to be sold.

While many cards are bought to send to oth-

never mailed. Instead they get posted on a wall

collection. A simple image on a card can express BB
very profound ideas, while others are humorous,
light or beautiful. Specialty stores, progres-

that embody the ideas promoted in the rest of Ap

Incidentally, I suggest that you have a
plan for moving out cards that aren't selling.
They can really drag down the sales of your
whole card section. The bestsellers can get lost
amid the images no one is really interested in,
making all your cards seem old and out-of-date.
Setting up a sales box can be a good way to move
them while still recovering much of your costs.
You can set it up as a regular thing or only at
special sales times. Bring in new, fresh images
to replace those you move out.
One other method for tracking inventory may
also be useful. This involves making out a 3 x
