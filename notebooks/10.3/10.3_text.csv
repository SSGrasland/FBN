This album of excellent pictures, and 85 brief texts covers women’s

merge both images of pioneers and role models into one —
courageous, versatile, persistent human beings of whom society can
be proud.” New York Times Book Review

women. This is a book to give your daughter and son. It says

TOURING

There were some basic parameters. The trip
had to begin in Madison, end in San Francisco,
and Rose had a car. I had three weeks of vaca-
tion. Everything else was possible. We talked
about the practical aspects of all the possible
routes. But in the end, the logic of feminist
bookselling passion won out -- the shortest
distance between any two points, we concluded,
is via the largest number of feminist book- n
stores. If we drove across Canada, we could stop | Pa,“ ET

""I've been selling books for two years now.

first sold books at the Canadian Women's Music
Festival in August (1985). The response was very
strong! Women had come from all over to the

""Bookwomb's main goal is to get the books
out to women. We sell at conferences, meetings,
festivals, readings, women's studies classes --
where ever we're invited (or can get The Book-
womb invited) and wherever we think we can sell
the books. We give away a lot of handouts list-
ing the type of books we specialize in -- cur-
rent feminist literature, women's studies text-
books, lesbian fiction, and children's books --
and telling women how to order books from us
when we don't happen to be at a conference.
""We do a lot of special orders to get
specific books that women want. We also donate
books to various fundraisers as a way of sup-
porting the women's community here and helping
people get to know us. Mostly this business
works through knowing people and because of our
reputation for the books we stock -- i.e., the
schools know we have anti-racist and non-sexist
children's books and that we have books about
Native children.""
""Our real purpose is just to get the books
out. We don't have the overhead a store has, so
we've had quite a lot of flexibility and have
been able sto use all of the income from book
sales to increase our stock. I don't take a
salary -- fortunately I have another job that
covers those needs.""
This fall Jahnet is packing all of her
books into her van and taking them out to women
in the far reaches of Northern Manitoba. Taking
two months off her ""regular job"" she'll go all
the way up to Thompson (which is as far north as
the roads go in Manitoba) and may then take the
train the rest of the way to Churchill in the
Arctic Circle...

time at the Ottawa Women's Bookstore. ""There for
awhile,"" Brenda told us, ""We called the Ottawa
Women's Bookstore almost daily with one question
or another! The Manual on Bookselling was very
helpful, too. But basically, learning the book-
selling trade came from just diving in. After
about eight months, though, I realized that
there are certain aspects of the book trade --
like who distributes who and who publishes
what-- that are very confusing. Once I realized
that it wasn't just me being confused, it began
to fall into place.""
Financing for the store came from private
sources. The first loan came from Joan's 97 year
old aunt, money that originated from the work of
Joan's mother, a single mother of four who home-
steaded on the Canadian prairie. Said Joan
later, ""I wanted to do something with that money
to return it to women."" Brenda also spoke enthu-
siastically about the decision to go for loans
from individual women, rather than bank loans or
government grants: ""I've been very encouraged
that we can use women's money, that there's a

Bold Print opened August 9, 1986 after a
great deal of planning by her co-founders Joan
Turner and Brenda Sinclair. Joan was off in the
Rockies climbing mountains while we were in
Winnipeg, so we were only able to meet with
Brenda (who has since left the store) and talked
to Joan by phone after returning to San Fran-
CİSCO.
Brenda told us that the bookstore's plan-
ning stage had lasted about a year and a half --
""About half a year too long!"" The original idea
had been to create a meeting space for women,
but it evolved into the bookstore. Joan and
Brenda both attended the Canadian Booksellers

Della McCreary welcomed us to Vancouver.
We'd met at the ABA and she'd offered both a
place to say and a tour of Press Gang if we got
as far as British Columbia. Touring Press Gang

operation support each other well. Press Gang is
expanding its publishing program.
Vancouver supports two thriving mid-sized
feminist bookstores, Ariel and the Vancouver
Women's Bookstore. Ariel was created in the
early seventies by two women who were pregnant
and wanted a workplace where they could bring
their babies. Then it was a co-op for many
years. Margo Dunn bought it with a partner six
years ago and has been running the store on her
own for the last four and a half years. The
Vancouver Women's Bookstore has been a volunteer
based collective right from the start. The
stores are located about half an hour apart in
different neighborhoods of Vancouver and seem to
do comparable amounts of business. Relations
between the two stores are friendly. While we
were talking to Margo at Ariel, Gloria called to
see if Ariel could go in with VWB on a order.
Ariel Books for Women
Margo teaches part-time in women's studies
as well as doing the bookstore. She describes
Ariel as ""a general woman's bookstore"". Ariel's
best-selling sections are feminist theory, fic-
tion (both Canadian and the International fic-
tion sections), the violence (incest, rape and
battering) and recovery section (alcohol/addic-
tion and Adult Children of Alcoholics), spirit-
uality, and of course lesbian fiction and non-

We talked at length about Canadian fiction,

with giving Canadian fiction it's own section
(U.S. authors are shelved in the international
fiction section), and about running a bookstore

Margo has made two major changes at Ariel
recently. One is building an office into the
back of the store, even though it meant decreas-
ing selling space to do it. Larger sales and the
need for better organization to keep abreast of
the continually increasing paper work made it
essential to move the bookstore's ""office"" from
her home back to the bookstore.
The other change was hiring a manager for
the store. Donna Kaye had been on the job for
two months and came to Ariel after six years
with the Coles Bookstore chain. Adding a manager
is freeing Margo to do a number of things she
hadn't had time for before, including setting up

on the collective. We talked about the changes
over the years in the availability of books, in
the structure of the store and the nature of the
collective:
""When we opened, we stocked as much as we
could -- women were publishing their own work --
essays and poetry and iidneas any form -- on
gestetners and mimeograph machines. Some of it
was hardly readable. But after a few years we
gave up that (visual) mediocrity...."" ""We sold a
lot of poetry then. Poetry was a medium for the
ideas of the time. But the ideas have gone into
other forms as they've been more fully developed
over time. But I miss the poetry being such a
vital part of =it all..... We still sell poetry,
of course, but not like we did in the begin-
ning.
VWB has stayed a volunteer collective,
partly out of economic necessity and signifi-
cantly out of commitment that one's politics and
income are clearer if not intermingled. The
volunteer structure has helped to finance their
downtown rent and to expand their stock over the
years. (VWB's stock has quadrupled -- at least
=-.overSthe last four years.) ""In the 70's,
women fought to get into the collective. We had
to split shifts to make room for everyone. Now
most of the new volunteers are between jobs or
work over the summer. Kathleen has written up
most of the procedures though, so it's easier
for newer staff to be here on their own than it
used to be.""

that Canadian Customs had expanded its gay book-
