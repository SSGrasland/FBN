“A model biography . . .”
THE LIFE OF EMILY CARR
by Paula Blanchard
Emily Carr, one of Canada's most gifted painters, is known for her
great, swirling images of the mighty forests of the Pacific Northwest.
| This sensitive biography focuses on Carr in the context of the social
and psychological barriers that have prevented creative women
in the past from achieving full expression and recognition.
A model biography, a perfect blend of careful, caring scholar-
ship with the human presences of Carr and a sensitive author."

Mary Colter, Builder Upon the Red Earth by
Virginia L. Gratton is a beautiful study, nicely
presented and reasonably priced. Colter (1869-
1958) was an artist, teacher, architect and
designer who chose to use local materials and
the traditions of the Southwest for her build-
ings which were spread out along the Santa Fe
Railway. Colter never married and had a reputa-
tion for being difficult and exacting. Her
buildings and interior designs are magic. Pub-

Inside Scars is a compelling incest recov-

her therapist (Charlotte Foster Hoffman). It was
initiated by Sheila out of her frustration that
so very little is available in book form that
presents the survivor's experience -- very
little that tells what it is like to face and
keep on facing the memories, doing the therapy
day by day and week by week, and going on. Most
of the books she found were either studies or
were written from a psychologist's view point.
Inside Scars includes excerpts from Sheila's
diary and poetry, drawings, and is interlaced
with comment by her therapist that make the book
doubly useful for both incest survivors in re-
