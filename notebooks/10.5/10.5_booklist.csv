Didi lives in her cool dream bubble, untouched by the Harlem heat that beats down on her brother until only drugs can soothe him. Didi escapes, without needles, in her tidy plans and stainless visions, etchings of ivycovered colleges where her true life will begin. Didi can survive inside her own safe mind, until Motown steps into her real world and makes it bearable. Together they can stand the often brutal present. What about the future?</p>


                        <p>Motown and Didi, two teenage loners in Harlem, become allies in a fight against Touchy, the drug dealer whose dope is destroying Didi's brother, and find themselves falling in love with each other.

In it, she describes the three major decisions of her life: “not to marry, to be an artist” and to listen to her “own voices.” She speaks of her parents who belonged to “a generation before their own” and how they instilled in her a sense of guilt, locking her in the prison of her self, a prison constructed “with the material of doubt and failure; of shattered dreams and unhappy loves, jealousy, hate, envy and the deadly sins of lovelessness and indifference,” but she also tells how she escapes from this prison with the knowledge that her inner sun takes its energy “from love, from creativity.”<br>
<i>Lily Briscoe: A Self-Portrait</i> is a book about the exercise of the will, the art of dreaming and the transcendent power of friendship. It is a very wise book written by a woman who waited—and lived—some sixty years before beginning to write.</p>",en,Second Printing,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.81130112416 Pounds, Width: 0.74803 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/56/9780889221956.jpg,Success,40.0,10.5
