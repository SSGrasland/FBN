Ilustrated by Suzanne Corbett. Tobor Sarah (2419

discount) ISBN 0-935079-17-3. This straightfor-
ward account of baby and family making is most
notable for its inclusiveness and presentation
of alternatives. In addition to heterosexual in-
tercourse, nine month pregnancy and vaginal
birth, the text explains alternative insemina-
tion and adoption, miscarriage and premature
birth, cesarean section and babies born with
disabilities. Although the black and white il-
lustrations are somewhat stiff, they do show
lesbian mothers, interracial families, adults
and children in wheelchairs, and people com-
municating with sign. (Ages 5-10)
