The essays gathered here, first presented at a 1984 conference sponsored by the Southwest Institute for Research on Women, analyze and interpret this new body of research.
<p>Each essay is accompanied by several commentaries that reveal the complex multicultural character of the West through the experiences of American Indian, Mexican-American, and Anglo-American (including Mormon) women. The discussion of domestic ideology examines what values Anglo women carried west and how their values influenced their perception of women of other races, cultures, and religions. An exploration of the religious experiences of indigenous women leads to a consideration of cross-cultural marriage as a catalyst of social and cultural change. A study of the Anglo family raises questions about its stability and the western values of individualism and self-determination. Essays on women's attitudes toward landscape, the place of Mexican-American women in the workforce, the legal rights of Indian women, the experiences of women on other frontiers, and on the public interpretation of women's history point toward exciting scholarly work that lies ahead.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",35.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/03/9780826310903.jpg,Success,74.0,11.5

<p>The term 'women of color' includes those of Asian, African, Latin American and Native American descent, who distinguish themselves politically from the dominant culture.

<p>This is an enriching book. Through reading it, we Latin American feminist women can identify the racism pervading our societies as well, which try as we may to conceal it does affect our personal and political relationships. Likewise, classism... undermines our solidarity, as does homophobia which hurts lesbians, and sexism, from which many women have not yet freed themselves.</p>

In devoting themselves to energetically serving their Lord, they often spend days and nights away from home ministering to their flock. How do they pursue this course in a church so fundamentalist that it decrees a woman's only place to be the home? In a religion that believes the Bible inerrant, Paul's admonition that women keep out of church business is taken very seriously. How then do the men and women in the churches view these women in authority?Elaine Lawless contends that it is the woman preacher's dedication to the sacred (as opposed to the secular) which provides her access to the pulpit. The preacher and her congregation firmly believe that her commission comes from God, and her task is not to overturn Pentecostal beliefs about home and family but to be both the epitome of good wife and mother and also the loyal servant of God. The congregation sees her as a mother figure, an image of nurturer that is compatible with Pentecostal beliefs about a woman's place.Lawless stresses that the women recognize, but perhaps could never articulate, that they walk a fine line between power and subservience. She concludes from hours of interviews and recordings that the woman pastor or preacher copes with this dichotomy by continuously re-scripting her life into a pattern acceptable to her community, because it is perceived by them, and by her, to be God's plan. The ""calling"" to serve becomes the central event in her life stories, and all her work revolves around it.Handmaidens of the Lord includes life histories of four women preachers, transcriptions of sermons, and analyses by Lawless of both life stories and sermons. It will be valuable to scholars of religion, ethnography, folklore, and women's studies.</p>",en,illustrated edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.96 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/55/9780812212655.jpg,Success,72.0,11.5

Employing feminist and poststructuralist methodologies, the essays examine a wide range of private life writings&#151;letters, journals, diaries, memoirs, pedagogical texts, and fictional and factual autobiographies. The concepts of theory and practice&#151;as opposing and mutually exclusive methodologies, as focal points for conflicting interpretations, and finally as complementary approaches to the study of literature&#151;are central to this collection.<p><i>The Private Self</i> explores the links between the historical devaluation of women's writings and the cultural definitions of women that have constrained their writing practices and excluded them from the canon of traditional autobiographical texts. Collectively, these essays expose the cultural biases that derive from notions of selfhood defined by a white, masculine, and Christian experience. In an effort to revise our prevailing concept of autobiography, these essays deal with differences of race, class, religion, sexual orientation, and gender.<p>Discussed here are writings by more than two dozen women including Jane Austen, Emily Dickinson, Alice James, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte Forten Grimke, Zora Neale Hurston, Maya Angelou, Sophie Kovalevsky, Anais Nin, Hilda Doolittle, and Simone de Beauvoir. The work of these writers reveals a split between public and private self-representations, and it is the notion of a private self expressed through women's autobiographical writings that forms the link among all the essays.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.07365121594 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches",42.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/88/9780807842188.jpg,Success,70.0,11.5

This most extensive systematic persecution of gays in American history occurred with the approval of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary Franklin Roosevelt, as dozens of sailors were ordered to identify and even seduce gay men in order to report their names to the authorities. Noted historian Lawrence Murphy reveals the details of this sordid campaign that ultimately generated a national scandal and first raised issues of gay rights and governmental persecution of homosexuals.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.433004703 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",62.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/49/9780918393449.jpg,Success,66.0,11.5
