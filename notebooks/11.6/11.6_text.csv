Naiad Press is continuing to offer its 50% backlist and frontlist specials 5
to 6 times each year and has just initiated a new special 45% discount to
sweeten your cash register at other times. Keep your shelves stocked and your
account paid up to date. Let us pay your rent again this year.
One women’s bookstore told us that we were 49% of their lesbian business
in 1988, another that we accounted for 35.5% of their income. Our GOAL is to
be over 50% of all of your lesbian-generated business and towards that end we
gear everything we do to maximize our service to you. You can now FAX
orders to us at (904) 539-9731, or call on either of the regular telephone
numbers [(904) 539-9322 or (904) 539-5965]. Officially, our hours are 9:00 am
to 5:30 pm Monday through Friday (EST). Unofficially, you can place orders
usually from 7:00 am until 9:00 pm seven days a week. If you get the answering
machine, all the better; we will call you back at once or as fast as possible with
less cost to you.
We also call many bookstores routinely once a month to be sure no one in
their busy schedule overlooks the monthly flyer. If you would be helped by that
reminder call and someone to call you and take your order, just let us know
and we will add you to the list.
In 1989 we will issue TWENTY-FOUR new books. By the time you read this,
TEN will be out . . . bringing women eagerly into your store.

ZN PRINTING! A novel about drinking, and loving, and lesbian life, it's
ultimately about courage and perspective and getting sober.
When Olivia leaves Malcolm and his bottles behind for Alison,
she doesn't see how closely Sister Wine follows. In fact, the lady
in green becomes her constant companion, filling in the hollow
spots with boozy cheer. When Olivia finally recognizes her, the
break-up begins.
“This book is real and warm and funny. The story and wisdom
are contained within sentences so well written they startle. It
will stay with you.”

All of us are part of what is loosely called a
Women-in-Print movement—as readers, writers, re-
viewers, artists, editors, publishers, distributors,
booksellers et al. of the hardcopy of the Women’s
Liberation Movement. We are part of a swelling move-
ment not only in the numbers of women involved, but
also in the quantity of artifacts this movement pro-
duces. Where once we could read everything that came
from our movement as it came out, now stores and
catalogs and backlists bulge with our success. It can
no longer be assumed we've all read the same pieces
or that the code words of earlier works evoke the
whole discourse.
We need to ask questions again about the heart of
the Women-in-Print movement. We represent differ-
ent skills, different structures of ownership (from col-
lective to partnership to sole proprietors), different
political commitments (from socialist to new age to
gay/Lesbian to feminist(!)), and different economic
realities (from earning livelihood in this work to vol-
unteer). We have women who learned their skills in
order to do the political work they are doing and
others who, having the skills and background, put
them in service to their political beliefs.

Here are some new titles that are just too good to
let having the flu keep me from telling you about. First
is Gluck: Her Biography by Diana Souhami. Gluck
(1895-1973) was a British Jewish Lesbian painter who
dressed in dykey attire, smoked a pipe, lived openly
with her lovers, and left a large number of paintings,
including significant self-portraits. She was the model
for Romaine Brooks “Peter, A Young English Girl” of
1926.
Gluck: Her Biography is thorough, informative
and highly readable. Her love of women is treated
with fairness and clarity. I imagine that the attention
brought to Gluck by Onlywomen Press (inclusion in
Past Participants and as the cover of The Reach) helped
to revive interest in this virtually forgotten artist.

Inspirations: Stories About Women Artists by
Leslie Sills is a beautiful, colorful children’s book fea-
turing four women artists: Georgia O'Keeffe, Frida
Kahlo, Alice Neel and Faith Ringgold. Ringgold is the
organizer of the “Coast to Coast: Women of Color

crafted book that will be enjoyed by adults as well as
younger people. Albert Whitman & Co., 5747 West

Unexpected Journeys: The Art and Life of Re-
medios Varo by Janet A. Kaplan is a welcome study of
the life and startling, lovely and enigmatic paintings
of the Spanish born Varo (1908-1963) who was con-
nected with the surrealists in Paris before fleeing from
the Nazis to Mexico City where she remained until her
death. Unexpected Journeys is a very satisfying book,
rich with information, color reproductions and photo-
graphs. Abbeville Press, $35 c], 0-89659-797-0.
Making Their Mark: Women Artists Move into
the Mainstream, 1970-1985, is one of those big, glossy
gorgeous books that also has a wealth of useful and
sometimes unexpected information. The core of the
book is a discussion of the work of 87 contemporary
women artists. Additional essays like “Women Artists
Today: Revolution or Regression?” by Marcia Tucker
and “Career Markers” by Ferris Olin and Catherine C.
Brawer make this an exceptionally interesting and
useful book. Abbeville, $45 cl, 0-89659-958-2.

What a treat—especially by comparison to the most
loathsome ailegediy feminist title I’ve read in many a
month: Marcia Cohen’s The Sisterhood: The True
Story of the Women Who Changed the Worid
(Simon & Schuster). Do not, under any cir-
cumstances, be misied into buying this book (and do
consider placing a wet umbrella atop it in stores). Its
portrayal of the women’s movement as the creature
of Manhattanites Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, and
Kate Millett (in that order) is so deepiy ahistorical,
elitist, homophobic, and racist that I couid list ex-
amplies from here to the Classified section. I'll just
note that Millett is virtually the only lesbian men-
tioned, and Flo Kennedy the oniy black woman; the
sole evidence presented of feminism’s impact is a
handful of stats about media coverage and middle-
management jobs; dozens of pages are devoted to
such key issues as Steinem’s dating and such water-
shed events as The Day Betty’s Dress Tore; and, in a
hilarious aside that symbolizes the book’s stupidity,
Friedan is credited with the term “herstory.”’ Why
am Í paying any attention to this execrable title?
Because, yes, it’s a Book of the Month Club selec-
tion that I see stacked on the bestsellers tabie of every
mainstream bookstore—still another reminder of the
urgent importance of feminist publishing.
