Esteemed by painters at home and abroad, Vigée Lebrun was one of the few women admitted to the French Academy at a time when a career as an artist was all but restricted to men. This honor catapulted her into contact with both high society and the greatest artists and writers of the day. Marie Antoinette, Catherine the Great, Benjamin Franklin, and Lord Byron were only a few of her vast and prestigious clientele. While describing her life as an artist, Vigée Lebrun also provides an exciting account of the dramatic events of her day, particularly the French Revolution and the Terror, from which she barely escaped. 8 black-and-white illustrations.

                        <p>This first-person narrative recounts the life of the French painter from the days of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

Viewing these archtypes as the inner counterparts of the outer world of cultural stereotypes, she demonstrates how men an women can gain an nvaluable sense of wholeness and integration when what they do is consistent with who they are. Dr. Bolen introduces these patterns in the guise of eight archetypal gods, or personality types, with whom the reader will identify. From the authoritarian power-seeking gods (Zeus, Poseidon) to the gods of creativity (Apollo, Hephaestus) to the sensual Dionysus, Dr. Bolen shows men how to identify their ruling gods, how to decide which to cultivate and which to overcome, and how to tap thepwer of these enduring archetypes in order to enrich and strengthen their lives. She also stresses the importance of understanding which gods you are attracted to and which are compatible with your expectations, uncovers the origins of the often-difficult father-son relationship, and explores society's deep conflict between nurturing behavior and the need to foster masculinity.</p>
<p>In <i>Gods in Everyman</i> Dr. Bolen presents us with a compassionate and lucid male psychology that will help all men and women to better understand themselves and their relationships with their fathers, their sons, their brothers, and their lovers.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Author Biography: Jean Shinoda Bolen, M.D., is a psychiatrist and Jungian analyst. A Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California Medical Center, Dr. Bolen is an internationally known teacher who links archetypal and spiritual realms with social, political, and ecological concerns. She has two children and lives in Mill Valley, California.</p>


                        <p>The long-awaited companion volume to Goddess in Everywoman, which sold more than 150,000 copies. Drawing upon the theories of Jung, Dr. Bolen explores the powerful inner patterns, or archetypes, that shape men's personalities. She introduces these inner patterns in the guise of eight gods or personality types, maintaining that understanding these archetypes is the key to self-awareness.

<p>When we first meet Baby, she's one of six black children abandoned by their parents during the Depression. They are roadwalkers — homeless wanderers across the rural South, leading a dangerous, almost enchanted life. One by one they are saved, lost, or simply disappear, until only Baby and a brother are left, living off the land — a primitive gypsy existence hauntingly described. Finally Baby is captured — almost like a wild animal — by the white farm manager of an old plantation where the children have been hiding. He sends her to an orphanage in New Orleans, where she guards the rich mythic content of her wandering against the invasive kindness of the nuns by covering the walls with strange, brilliant drawings of flowers and animals.</p>
<p>We next see Baby decades later, through the eyes of her daughter, Nanda, who at thirty-six looks back at her own childhood. Baby and Nanda move into the middle class through Baby's eccentrically successful career — first as a seamstress, then as a designer of dresses for rich white women. Raised a princess in the protective circle of Baby's magic, Nanda in her teens is suddenly catapulted into the white world when she is sent off to integrate a white Catholic girls' school in the East. Seeing herself as her mother saw herself — alone in an alien place, Nanda finds an entirely different means of survival.</p>
<p>A rich and wonderfully fresh — often astonishing — evocation of the black experience in the South, seen through the lives of twofascinating women.</p>",en,,Weight: 1.55 Pounds,22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/62/9780807063262.jpg,Success,28.0,12.1
