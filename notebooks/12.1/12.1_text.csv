became regular benefits early on. And salaries crept
New up slowly.
Fifteen years later, as New Words celebrates a
major anniversary, much of what we've achieved is
the common success of many women’s bookstores in
WORDS large urban centers. We owe much to the wonderfully
diverse women’s community in Boston. We serve an
academic feminist community, a political feminist
community, buyers of non-sexist children’s books,
readers of lesbian fiction, readers of recovery from
violence, abuse, and alcoholic families. We also serve
readers of no particular identification who are looking
for a book for vacation, a plane ride, my father who-
does-not-understand-my-life, my sister who’s-
devoted-herself-to-husband-and-children, my
sister-in-law who-doesn’t-really-read-very-much-
but-it’s-her-birthday...
Sections in the store have increased and changed
to reflect the input and interest of the women’s com-
munity and our growing commitment to issues of
race, class, national and ethnic diversity. These sec-
tions include International Fiction and Poetry, Women
of Color — U.S., Lesbian and Gay Politics, Jewish
Women, Violence and Abuse, and more.
The growth in business has been met by an ex-
pansion in the collective. We're now five full-time
members and a one-day-a-week bookkeeper, Doris
Reisig, who keeps the books for several alternative
businesses and is crucial to our peace of mind. Rita
and Jean left full participation in the bookstore in 1979.
Madge Kaplan came in 1979 and stayed till 1987 when
she left to pursue a career in radio journalism. In 1982,

and evidence of sanity maintained during previous
involvement in the women’s community.
Lest it seem that we sit around and laugh all the
time, we do have the standard arenas of Stress at
Work. Covering the front desk — that all-important
selling task — which prevents one from completing
anything else at the same time is a chronically un-
popular job. Answering the two phone lines, selling
concert tickets, and receiving botched publisher
orders also lead to momentary dips in job satisfaction.
Juggling the months’ schedules of weekends on and
off (no one works more than 40 hours a week) taxed
our creativity. The extra work preparing for readings
— guessing how many books to order, what to say for
an introduction — ups the stress level. (And volun-
teering to write articles like this makes us question out
ability to assess the time constraints of a normal work
week.)
Recent sources of greater satisfaction include our
quarterly newsletter, now over a year old; our com-
puterized inventory system (Word-stock), also over a
year in use; and the increasingly popular reading
series co-sponsored with publishers. As part of our
annual birthday celebration in April we have a two-
day 20% sale on everything, culminating in a party
Sunday afternoon. It’s the equivalent of doing three
weeks of business in fourteen hours and throwing a
bash for 400 at the same time. It makes us crazy but
we love it and so do our customers. (This year in honor

policy viable by continuing to pack carefully returns
of undamaged books to allow for resale of books in
new condition.
The rationale behind the new policy, which goes
much farther than the returns policies of most pub-
lishers, is that it’s much less expensive for the publish-
er to absorb the loss on these books than for the
bookseller to do so. The cost to the publisher is merely
the over-run printing cost (10-15% of list price for
Alyson titles, more for GMP titles distributed by Aly-
son); the cost to a store is 56-60% of list. Thus the new
policy is a contribution toward making the industry
more efficient. If it’s a successful experiment, perhaps
other publishers will follow suit. O

matic new gay detective, Cam. Cam is spending the
summer on Cape Cod to rest up from his lover and
their quarrels, his San Francisco bar, and the public-
ity stemming from his solving a recent murder. But
what does he find in a rambling old house on the
Cape? Murder, of course.
SCIENCE FICTION
Key West, 2720 A.D. by William K. Eakins
($9.00 pb, 0-915175-34-7) is “science fiction of the
highest order,” according to publisher Knights Press.
Knights also states that Key West has “all the gim-
micks and gadgets one wants in top SF, plus a logi-
cal story line that keeps moving.” I'll take their word
for it; science fiction titles for gay men don’t come
out every season. (Hint, hint to publishers.) O
