Bright, young, and energetic, Leonowens was well-suited to these roles, and her writings convey a heartfelt interest in the lives, legends, and languages of Siam's rich and poor. She also tells of how she and the King often disagreed on matters domestic. After all, this was the first time King Mongkut had met a woman who dared to contradict him, and the governess found the very idea of male domination intolerable. Overworked and underpaid, Leonowens would eventually resign, but her exchanges with His Majestyâ€”heated and otherwiseâ€”on topics like grammar, charity, slavery, politics, and religion add much to her diary's rich, cross-cultural spirit, its East-meets-West appeal.</p>
<p>Over the years, that appeal has only increased. Eighty years after it first appeared, this memoir inspired the popular book and film, <b>Anna and the King of Siam</b>, and a few years later the hit musical, <b>The King and I</b>. Now comes yet another version, <b>Anna and the King</b>, the new film starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat. Here, then, is the original tale, presented with many reproductions of the fine drawings that the King had offered as gifts to Leonowens. <b>The English Governess at the Siamese Court</b> remains engaging as a story of adventure, fascinating as a picture of nineteenth-century Bangkok, and intriguing as an account of life inside King Mongkut's palace.</p>",en,Reissue,"Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.3 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/73/9780195888973.jpg,Success,87.0,12.2

After saving the old man's life, Will is invited to tea by the grateful and slightly senile Lord Nantwich, who, surprised by Will's impressive lineage and appalled at his state of idle unemployment, engages the young man to write the Nantwich life story. Thus begins the unusual relationship that forms the core of this funny, sad and beautifully written novel. The Swimming Pool Library weaves a rich and fascinating tapestry of Britain's gay subculture spanning pre-World War I through the sexually abandoned early '80s, stopping short at the doorstep of AIDS. Hollinghurst's prose is fresh, witty and wise, and his ever-surprising, sinuously unfurling story is told with insouciant grace and unabashed sexuality. BOMC and QPBC alternates.

<p>The art of this Tarot is amazing, brilliant and intense. It follows the form of a traditional Tarot and is able to blend the Qabalistic Tree of Life with Pagan symbolism. The High Priestess stands proudly in the Goddess pose and wears a garter showing that she is indeed a high priestess of many covens. The High Priest shows an older but power-filled man holding an athame. Strength shows that this card represents spiritualâ€”the lion is tamed by the woman's spirit and meekly licks her chin. The Devil loses its evil reputation and returns to his original form as he becomes ""The Honed One,"" showing a couple staring in awe at the powerful and loving God crowned in the horns of a stag. The Minor Arcana is also fully illustrated. Each card features strong characters in rural settings, evoking a feeling of ancient mystery and Pagan spirituality.</p>
<p>The included booklet features two spreads as well as the meanings of every card. Even if you've never used the Tarot before, this deck is ideal for beginners and experienced Tarot readers alike. And that's not all...</p>
<p>For more than half a century, Witchcraft has been very eclectic, borrowing from spiritual traditions that blended with its basic concepts. Here, the coloring is taken from the Tree of Life, making this deck also ideal for ceremonial magicians as well as Pagans of all kinds.</p>
<p>This original and unique deck features some incredibly realistic art and will inspire you to more intuitive readings and more intense meditative, pathworking, and magical work.</p>",en,Cards,"Height: 5 Inches, Length: 3 Inches, Weight: 0.48722159902 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",51.94,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/93/9780875426693.jpg,Success,44.0,12.2

Central to Mellody's approach is the concept that the codependent adult's injured inner child needs healing. Recovery from codependence, therefore, involves clearing up the toxic emotions left over from these painful childhood experiences.</p>
