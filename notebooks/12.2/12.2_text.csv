How To Make This Deal Work For Both Of Us!
Since we give you 60 days to pay your invoices, it's easier to order an adequate quantity of books
without overdoing your budget. An account that's current costs us less to maintain so we can give
you more! We ship orders same or next day so the orders will be timely—even coming from Texas.
Order enough books to cover the month instead of doing weekly orders from the distributors. We're
trying to make it easier to control your inventory without feeling a need to over-order to take advantage
of bigger discounts, only to end up processing returns to contro! costs. That costs both of us too
much money. Keep the account current and we'll be happy to ship books in any quantity you feel you
need. There will be one more check to write, but we think you'll find it's worth it. If there’s ever a
problem with paying the account, please get in touch with us immediately. We'll try to work something
out. We're asking all our customers to have one of our credit applications on file—hnew customers
and old. We'll process the application and, with your approved credit, free freight and a 45% discount
will assture you hmore profitaeble sales with B Annep hBooks. lf ouor terms suound a îittrle tough, i.t's because
this plan will only work if our receivables stay current— otherwise, the financing costs make it impossi-

Across the Great River, by Irene Beltrán Hernández. 1989. 128 pages.
ISBN 0-934770-96-4 LC 89-289 $8.50
Across the Great River is Irene Beltrán Hernández’ first novel, which chronicles, through the
eyes of a young girl, a Mexican family's illegal entry into the United States. The family's
experiences with labor smugglers, a folk healer, rape and violence are all told with the innocence
and directness of a young girl who must face the harshness and reality of life at an early age.
The Wedding, by Mary Helen Ponce. 1989. 200 pages.
ISBN 0-934770-97-2 LC 89-6933 $8.50
The Wedding, by Mary Helen Ponce, is a hilarious, heart-warming glimpse of Mexican American
blue collar subculture, its predilection for low-riding cars and kitsch, all seen through the ironically
rose-colored lenses of a bride-to-be who is already in ""a family way."" Ponce details the social
relationships, the physical and psychological preparations for her blushing protagonist's wedding
in brush strokes that are so incisive that they cut through the layers of cultural tradition to reveal
what we always guessed was there: customs and mores that entrap women and hinder their
intellectual development. Ponce is the author of Taking Control, a collection of stories about
women struggling to gain control of their lives.

The New Product Problem
Videos are a new product, and they are different

through a tape and get a glimpse of what it’s about.
We are willing to send a free tape with promos of our
videos to bookstores that sell our tapes. The free
promo tape will enable the store staff to learn more
about what they’re selling. It can be loaned or rented
to prospective customers, and it can be shown at
special events at the store.
The Quality Problem
Customers need to be educated that videos are
not multi-million dollar Hollywood movies. Each of
our tapes has been a clear improvement over the
previous tape, but it is still not possible for us to
produce a tape that looks as good as a movie that costs
thirty million dollars. Scripting, location scouting,
