The association of Sappho with female homosexuality has made her a particularly compelling and yet problematic subject of literary speculation; and in the responses of different cultures to the challenge the poet presents, DeJean finds evidence of the standards imposed on female sexuality through the ages. She focuses largely though not exclusively on the French tradition, where the Sapphic presence is especially pervasive. Tracing re-creations of Sappho through translation and fiction from the mid-sixteenth century to the period just prior to World War II, DeJean shows how these renderings reflect the fantasies and anxieties of each writer as well as the <i>mentalitÃ©</i> of his or her day.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3117504589 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",5.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/67/9780226141367.jpg,Success,85,12.5

This Provocative Volume Helps To Redress That Neglect. Tracing The Development Of Fraternalism From Early Modern Western Europe Through Eighteenth-century Britain To Nineteenth-century America, Mary Ann Clawson Shows How White Males Came To Use Fraternal Organizations To Resolve Troubling Questions About Relations Between The Sexes And Between Classes: American Fraternalism In The 1800s Created Bonds Of Loyalty Across Class Lines And Made Gender And Race Primary Categories Of Collective Identity. British Men Had Symbolically Become Stone Masons To Express Their Commitment To The Emerging Market Economy And To The Social Value Of Craft Labor. Clawson Points Out That American Fraternalism Fulfilled Similar Purposes, As Fraternal Organizations Reconciled Individualism And Mutuality For Many Who Were Discomfited By The Conflict Of Egalitarian Principles And Capitalist Industrial Development. Fraternalism's Extraordinary Appeal Rested Also On The Assertion Of Masculine Solidarity In The Face Of Feminine Claims To Moral Leadership. Nevertheless, Visions Of Solidarity Were Contradicted When Fraternal Organizations Became Increasingly Entrepreneurial, Seeking To Maximize Their Own Growth Through Systematic Marketing Of Membership.

Here also are fathers and brothers and stories of men in their youth, when rivalry often develops more naturally than alliance.

Her analysis of how human communities are related to their environment opens a perspective that goes beyond overt changes in the landscape.</p><p>Merchant brings to light the dense network of links between the human realm of economic regimes, social structure, and gender relations, as they are conditioned by a dominant worldview, and the ecological realm of plant and animal life. Thus we see how the integration of the Indians with their natural world was shattered by Europeans who engaged in exhaustive methods of hunting, trapping, and logging for the market and in widespread subsistence farming. The resulting colonial ecological revolution was to hold sway until roughly the time of American independence, when the onset of industrialization and increasing urbanization brought about the capitalist ecological revolution. By the late nineteenth century, Merchant argues, New England had become a society that viewed the whole ecosphere as an arena for human domination. One can see in New England a mirror of the world, she says. What took place there between 1600 and 1850 was a greatly accelerated recapitulation of the evolutionary ecological changes that had occurred in Europe over a span of 2,500 years.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",27.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/46/9780807842546.jpg,Success,87,12.5
