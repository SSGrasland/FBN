Ordering and Receiving
We're very attached to the green loose-leaf note-
book that records journal orders. It’s one of the few
survivors of the pre-computer era. Each periodical is
listed on a separate sheet with name, address, phone
number, return policy (covers only, mastheads, or
whole issue), and distributor or contact person on top
with a grid below with room for information about
each order: date received, issue number and/or title,
quantity received, wholesale price, retail price, num-
ber sold, number returned, amount paid, date paid,
check number. The most crucial part of this system is
to enter information at the point of unpacking new
periodicals; if receiving is kept accurate and up-to-
date, the rest of the recordkeeping works well. These
sheets are alphabetized by title and the notebook is
kept at the front desk.
Because the sales records are kept on individual
sheets, it’s easy to see the selling pattern of each one
over the course of the months and years. I go through
the green journal book once every seven to eight
weeks to make consignment payments (see below)
and also to spot standing orders that may need to be
increased or decreased or shipments that seem un-
believably overdue (like a quarterly we haven’t gotten
in nine months) or to reorder a special issue that’s
selling exceptionally well.
Back Issues

Women of Power, Heresies and Radical America;
these theme issues are popular with our customers

Somewhat more unusually, Emily was cited in
the Coddrington divorce case in 1864 for alienating

was held that she suffered no lasting damage to her
reputation. Read more about it in The Pink Plaque

extends her earlier essay on the social construction of
illness (Illness as Metaphor) in this compassionate and
clear-headed analysis of AIDS. Kincaid’s essay offers an
unblinking look at life in the tourist economy of a small
Caribbean island (Antigua); it’s full of irony and wit and
sharp political insight.

Heartscape by Sue Gambill, Naiad Press, 1989, $8.95
paperback. Leslie flees her personal life in Province-
town and a sense of alienation from American society,
to go to the comfort of old friends in Portugal. She's
lived there before and found Portugal a place where
people live with open hearts. Since her last visit Leslie
has come out and she isn’t sure how well being out as
a Lesbian and living in Portugal will mesh. Through
Heartscape we explore her identities as a Lesbian and
as a U.S. citizen. Gambill raises some provocative
questions about both identities. And yes, there is a
love interest, though that is a secondary theme.
