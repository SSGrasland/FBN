Women at the Helm
by Jeannine Talley
All her life Jeannine Talley had a dream of
sailing around the world. She had her doctorate and
was teaching folklore and mythology at UCLA
when she bought her first boat. She started Seawor-
thy Women, a sailing school to teach women to sail
in a supportive, non-threatening way.
When she met Joy Smith, they talked about
sailing around the world from their very first con-
versation. Joy owned a 34-foot boat, and also had
KOOSNE her own business chartering. The two became part-
ners and they decided to make the voyage.
Women at the Helm tells how their dream
became a reality and relates Jeannine and Joy's
cruising experiences on their way around the world.
They take turns being captain and share the magic
and romance of the South Pacific.
v Articulate, poetic and filled with adventure,
Women at the Helm will inspire and delight adven-
turous women everywhere.

Kate Millett’s
Sita
The Classic Lesbian Romance
Kate Millett has always loved ‘playing store.’ She
started out in coke bottles at five and stood treats
for the neighborhood kids. For years she’s sold her
art posters to women for preposterous prices (five
to fifty dollars) and her hand-pulled numbered
editions of silkscreens for democratic ones (one
hundred dollars). You can write to her about them
at 295 Bowery, NYC, 10003
Now she has another bee in her bonnet.
When Farrar Stauss remaindered those beautiful hard cover copies of Siza with Kate’s own
drawing on the cover, she said, why not, they’re mine — and bought them up herself. This
year she got the rights back so that Ballantine couldn’t publish any more of its ugly little
paperback and now, as they used to say back home, she’s cornered the market.
And she’s selling these autographed hard cover first
editions of Sita at a discount. For $10.00 each (postage and handling included) to individuals
and to bookstores, she’s offering them for $125.00 for a box of twenty-five — that’s $5.00 each
for a hardcover book whose front flap price was $10.00 then and would be $17.00 now. She
wants you to pay the UPS charge. If you’re out of New York State, there is no sales tax.
This is a deal, she says, and she’s gearing up for your
order. Don’t worry, she’s got a lot of books. It’s all part of her “little red hen does it herself”
theory: women taking things into their own hands and writers taking charge of their lives. She’s
probably right — go for it.
$125 per box of 25 copies.

Across the Great River, by Irene Beltrán Hernández. 1989. 128 pages.
ISBN 0-934770-96-4 LC 89-289 $8.50
Across the Great River is Irene Beltrán Hernández’ first novel, which chronicles, through the
eyes of a young girl, a Mexican family's illegal entry into the United States. The family's
experiences with labor smugglers, a folk healer, rape and violence are all told with the innocence
and directness of a young girl who must face the harshness and reality of life at an early age.
The Wedding, by Mary Helen Ponce. 1989. 200 pages.
ISBN 0-934770-97-2 LC 89-6933 $8.50
The Wedding, by Mary Helen Ponce, is a hilarious, heart-warming glimpse of Mexican American
blue collar subculture, its predilection for low-riding cars and kitsch, all seen through the ironically
rose-colored lenses of a bride-to-be who is already in "a family way." Ponce details the social
relationships, the physical and psychological preparations for her blushing protagonist's wedding
in brush strokes that are so incisive that they cut through the layers of cultural tradition to reveal
what we always guessed was there: customs and mores that entrap women and hinder their
intellectual development. Ponce is the author of Taking Control, a collection of stories about
women struggling to gain control of their lives.

Claire McNab
Detective Inspector Carol Ashton returns in the most
formidable, baffling, and important homicide case of her
career...
Four women are dead, each strangled with an orange cord,
their bodies ritualistically arranged. The Australian press has
sensationalized the murders, especially the fact that one of the
victims was a lesbian. Madeline Shipley, media star, claims
that she has been in contact with “The Orange Strangler.”
Amidst these pressures, Carol’s lover, Sybil Quade, is
increasingly restive with the secrecy of their relationship. As

Montana Feathers MONTANA
Penny Hayes
A spellbinding new novel of America’s frontier days by the
beloved author of The Long Trail and Yellowthroat.
Young and pampered Elizabeth Reynolds fulfills a dream: to
spend a year on her aunt’s ranch in Montana Territory before
she marries Jonathan Stanton. But nothing in her sheltered life
has prepared her for this harsh land of majesty and terrors.
Or for Vivian Blake. Or for how Elizabeth feels about her.
Vivian, a widow who runs her own sheep ranch, is as tough,
honest and uncompromising as the land she has made her own.
Elizabeth is drawn to her with a desperate passion she knows
must end with her return to New York...
