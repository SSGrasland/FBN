2,"For every woman searching for a real alternative to tradi-
tional patriarchal religion, for every woman who wants to
discover and empower her own feminine spirit, this book
is literally cause for celebration. Barbara Walker, author of
The Woman’ Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets, offers a
wealth of techniques, procedures, and suggestions for both
individual and group ceremonies, including
@ Holidays for women to celebrate
@ Tools and rituals for invocations
@ Herbs and plants @ Chantmaking
@® Sewing a priestess robe @ Making mandalas
@ The laws of the Goddess @® The use of crystals
..and much more. Blending the time-honored rituals of
goddess- -worship with modern concern for healing the
wounds of Mother Earth and enhancing the sense of global
sisterhood, Barbara Walker points the way to a more mean-
ingful spiritual consciousness for every woman.

Enclosed is a copy of our “no styrofoam” insert.
We've been using it for several months but with no
responses from publishers yet. Ingram and Inland are

there's styrofoam in a package, the woman who unpacks
it marks the packing slip “Styrofoam Alert” and when I
pay the bill I insert the the note. The idea came from a
promotional letter to booksellers about H. Patricia

the subject of scathing reviews from male critics, who
protest that it portrays lesbians as “beautiful and happy.”
Female intellectuals adamantly defend the novel and the
discourse has entered the airwaves as Roffiel has been
interviewed on national television.
The male publisher read the manuscript on the first
night after he had received it. He called Roffiel the next
day to sign a contract. His house, Editorial Planetá, is one
of the major publishing houses in the Spanish speaking
world. The novel has already been optioned for a
Spanish-Mexican film co-production. A U.S. feminist
publisher is currently considering the English translation.
Mexico has a tradition of gay male literature, but Amora
is the first lesbian literature to be published in the
mainstream.

Mexico's largest daily, El Excelsior. She was also a

PRISONERS OF RITUAL:
An Odyssey Into Female Genital Circumcision in Africa
Hanny Lightfoot-Klein
“An illuminative book . . . illustriously fair-minded... Among writings on genital mutilations, therefore, it is unique
in giving the reader a 360 degree understanding of the social and personal significance of such practices. It tells the
truth and the truth is devastating. . .. In addition to being a contribution to the scholarship of anthropological
sexology, Prisoners of Ritual is an adventure story—an extraordinary midlife odyssey of a solo woman’s desert ‘wal-
kabout’ through the spaces and the minds of Nilotic Africa. THERE’S NOTHING ELSE QUITE LIKE IT!”—John

of publication at that time. So I had no alternative but
to join forces with other women and start a press. But
I didn't know that at the time. It took me another 5 or
6 years to get that one together, but I headed in that
direction.
I was lovers with Wendy Cadden, who's an artist
and organizer. In 1968 we had put on a play of mine
at Antioch College in Ohio, a play called “The Cell.” It
was very radical and when we came out to the West
Coast I mimeographed it. I thought maybe the San
Francisco Mime Troupe would be interested in it, but
they turned it down. But they did let me use their
mimeograph machine, which I had never used before.
I was so frustrated trying to learn to use it. The way
people did things then was to say, “Oh, here try this.”
And then they would leave you, and you would try it,
and you either figured it out or you didn’t.
C: Not a lot of on-the-job training.

we did the anthology. Wendy edited the graphics.
J: It was lavender pages with white tissue paper for
the graphics because we didn’t understand printing
and we were afraid that the ink would show through
on the other side of the page. There was no one to ask.
We thought there was no way to have paper thick
enough to run graphics on. I don't know what we
were thinking of! We got very heavy paper. Wendy’s
friend, Vicki Jacobs, fronted us $300 for paper, and we
printed 1,000 copies. It was book length. It had about
60 writers and artists in it altogether. I was such a
radical editor that I even took all of the author's names
off of their work and they were listed in the back in

Facing the Problem
Four years ago, WiP addressed itself to the diffi-
DÆDALUS culty of campaigning to improve the status of
women in the industry without any firm statistical
basis for its arguments and, through one of its sub-
committees, set about commissioning a survey. It
approached the Polytechnic of North London and,
with an initial grant from the Social and Economic
Aa Research Council, researcher Susan Alice Fischer
was employed to start the pilot study, which lasted
best from May to December 1987. That initial study was
reported in the British book trade weekly The Book-
seller under the headline, Twice as Many, Half as
Powerful? And indeed, the final results of the com-
feminist, pleted survey don’t do much to disprove the pessi-
mistic interim assessment.
Atea “If you look at publishing as a whole, women
seem to do quite well,” said Frances Tomlinson of
the Polytechnic of North London, who supervised
and the survey. “But if you look at the quality of women
entering the industry — very highly qualified, with
degrees, and far more women than men — and then
look at who are the people getting through, the ones
Spet going up the career scale, you see it is men rather

EMPOWERMENT AND SELF-DETERMINATION are just two of the words that come

THESE ARE STRONG WOMEN—SURVIVORS. They set boundaries, take risks,

Kate Millett’s
Sita
The Classic Lesbian Romance
Kate Millett has always loved ‘playing store.’ She
started out in coke bottles at five and stood treats
for the neighborhood kids. For years she’s sold her
art posters to women for preposterous prices (five
to fifty dollars) and her hand-pulled numbered
editions of silkscreens for democratic ones (one
hundred dollars). You can write to her about them
at 295 Bowery, NYC, 10003
Now she has another bee in her bonnet.
When Farrar Stauss remaindered those beautiful hard cover copies of Sita with Kate’s own
drawing on the cover, she said, why not, they’re mine — and bought them up herself. This
year she got the rights back so that Ballantine couldn’t publish any more of its ugly little
paperback and now, as they used to say back home, she’s cornered the market.
And she’s selling these autographed hard cover first
editions of Sita at a discount. For $10.00 each (postage and handling included) to individuals
and to bookstores, she’s offering them for $125.00 for a box of twenty-five — that’s $5.00 each
for a hardcover book whose front flap price was $10.00 then and would be $17.00 now. She
wants you to pay the UPS charge. If you’re out of New York State, there is no sales tax.
This is a deal, she says, and she’s gearing up for your
order. Don’t worry, she’s got a lot of books. It’s all part of her “little red hen does it herself”
theory: women taking things into their own hands and writers taking charge of their lives. She’s
probably right — go for it.

MIGHTY MOUNTAIN AND THE THREE STRONG WOMEN, our
second children’s title, is now available. In this thumpingly
funny story based on an old Japanese folk tale, a young sumo
wrestler on his way to enter the contest for the strongest man in
all Japan encounters Kuniko. Irresistibly drawn by her, he
meets her mother and grandmother, and the three strong women
train him for success. MIGHTY MOUNTAIN is the second
title issued under our Kazan Books imprint, dealing with
Pacific Rim culture.
For those who think of Volcano Press as a women’s health and
social issues publisher, we can only say that if life is a spiral path, the time had come for us to
broaden our interests, and turn toward excellence in children’s books. In this vein, our best-selling
