Dear FBN,
Years ago, we tried listing bookstores in our di-
rect-mail catalog, but we found it too difficult to be
sure who to list. And some stores were offended when
they felt they should have been listed, but weren’t.
Naiad seems to have found a good solution to all
this, and we'd like to follow their lead. So we're mak-
ing this offer: If your store carries at least 75% of our
lesbian and/or gay male titles, we'd like to list you
when we send mailing directly to potential customers.
Just send us your store name, address, and phone, and
indicate whether you qualify for catalogs directed at
lesbians, gay men, or both.
This is the kind of idea that wouldn't have
reached us without FBN. Thanks.
With best wishes,
Sasha Alyson

Kate Millett’s
Sita
The Classic Lesbian Romance
Kate Millett has always loved ‘playing store.’ She
started out in coke bottles at five and stood treats
for the neighborhood kids. For years she’s sold her
art posters to women for preposterous prices (five
to fifty dollars) and her hand-pulled numbered
editions of silkscreens for democratic ones (one
hundred dollars). You can write to her about them
at 295 Bowery, NYC, 10003
Now she has another bee in her bonnet.
When Farrar Stauss remaindered those beautiful hard cover copies of Sita with Kate’s own
drawing on the cover, she said, why not, they’re mine — and bought them up herself. This
year she got the rights back so that Ballantine couldn’t publish any more of its ugly little
paperback and now, as they used to say back home, she’s cornered the market.
And she’s selling these autographed hard cover first
editions of Siza at a discount. For $10.00 each (postage and handling included) to individuals
and to bookstores, she’s offering them for $125.00 for a box of twenty-five — that’s $5.00 each
for a hardcover book whose front flap price was $10.00 then and would be $17.00 now. She
wants you to pay the UPS charge. If you’re out of New York State, there is no sales tax.
This is a deal, she says, and she’s gearing up for your
order. Don’t worry, she’s got a lot of books. It’s all part of her “little red hen does it herself”
theory: women taking things into their own hands and writers taking charge of their lives. She’s
probably right — go for it.

IV INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST BOOKFAIR

women and to learn what exciting things they /we are
Barcelona was the most incredible international doing in so many different parts of the world and to
feminist bookfair yet! The fair was clearly conceived celebrate our similarities and our differences. My
and organized around specific goals. The atmosphere S ; `
was relaxed and casual. There were no major political
splits during or before the Fair. Unlike previous fairs,
there was little focus on readings. It was not centered
on Famous Writers — rather, the focus was on the
work of publishing and distributing the writing, a
format reminiscent of the best of the Women In Print
Conferences in the U.S. It was a wonderful energy and
a wonderful atmosphere for exchange of ideas, in-
sights, politics, skills and passions. The entire experi-
ence was inspiring, renewing, and revitalizing.
It was wonderful to wander the aisles seeing
books, pamphlets and posters from so many countries
in so many languages — AIDS educational materials
for/by women in Africa, non-sexist math and geogra-
phy books for students in Zimbabwe, the “women’s
line” of books from a Pakistani publisher, feminist
comic books from Mexico, women’s books published
in South America, as well as from all over western
Europe and — even — the first issue of a lesbian and
gay newspaper from the U.S.S.R. There were books
that looked familiar (Fruta Prohibidas? Oh, right! Or-
anges are not the Only Fruit!) and books that didn’t look
or sound familiar — but that were very familiar —
Nuestros cuerpos, nuestras vidas in the Spanish edition,
rather than the Spanish language edition published in
the U.S. by the Our Bodies Ourselves Collective that
we sell in the States.

publishers and need to attend both workshops — also
because the booksellers from over-developed coun-
tries need to, and are eager to, learn how to support
“third-world” publishing.
The Heart of the Conversation
As exciting as the panels were, many of the most
exciting exchanges took place in small, informal con-
versations. A big part of the Fair for FBN is collecting
“verbal press releases,” catching up on the interna-
tional news, finding “old” friends from previous Fairs
and learning about new successes and projects all
around the world and, of course, talking with book-
sellers. Because there aren't enough panels for all the
women to talk about their work, the informal conver-
sations really are the heart of the Fair.
In one of these conversations I “found” Acca,
the Swedish women’s press. They weren’t lost, of
course, but I'd heard that they'd stopped publishing
books — but missed the more important news that
they’d switched to publishing a monthly feminist
newspaper, a format more fluid than book publish-
ing and so had only changed form, not stopped
publishing.
Kali For Women (India) is financially stable at 12
books a year. The Egyption women’s press did get off
the ground but is focused on publishing pamphlets

Mary Dorsy (A Noise from the Woodshed/
Onlywomen) stopped by FBN’s booth and told hilar-
ious stories about being the first lesbian to receive the
Rooney Prize. It seems that an Irish-American family
(owners of the Pittsburgh Steelers) decided to endow
a literary prize in Ireland which, over the years, has
been very well admistered and become quite presti-
gious. In 15 years, three of the awards have gone to
women (""Which is quite high for Ireland""), and twice
the awards have gone to books that included gay
(male) characters, though ”Of course no one would
assume that the writers were gay” but this is certainly
the first time the award has gone to a book that in-

LAS VEGAS: All year I had been wondering what
Las Vegas had to do with the book industry. It’s not a
city one goes to for bookstores, that’s for sure. It isn't
the heart of a gutsy and innovative small press move-
ment. And, unless steak and fries is your meal of
choice, forget eating.
But the moment I hit “The Strip” it was perfectly
clear: Thousands of booksellers and publishers had
been beamed into a science fiction novella in the scene
where the hyper-spacers go for R&R on a planet de-
signed for every kind of gambling, drinking, drug-
ging, sexing, and quick-fix entertainment known to a
variety of species of “man”-kind. In the course of the
convention I thought of at least a dozen scenes in sf
novels that could have been inspired by Las Vegas .
In contrast to the ever-present clattter of slot
machines and the high density noise that is the sound
of Vegas, the convention floor seemed calm and
nearly serene by comparison. All the booths were on also welcome and should be accompa-

meet the consumerist needs of new agers. The fact is,
however, that these new agers do not understand Indian
people or our struggles for survival and thus can have
no genuine understanding of Indian spiritual practices.
The result of this new age craze is nothing less
than spiritual and cultural genocide for the Indian
people. The one thing that has maintained the sur-
vival of Indian people through 500 years of colonial-
ism has been the spiritual bonds that keep us together.
When the colonizers saw the strength of our spiritual-
ity, they tried to destroy Indian religions by making
them illegal. They forced Indian children into white,
missionary schools and cut their tongues if they spoke
their Native languages. Sundances were made illegal
and Indian participation in the Ghost Dance precipi-
tated the Wounded Knee massacre. Our colonizers
recognized that it was our spirituality that maintained
our spirit of resistance and sense of community.
Today, many white writers, such as Lynn An-
drews, are continuing the practice of destroying In-
dian spirituality. They trivialize Native American
practices so that they lose their spiritual force. They
have the white privilege and power to make them-
selves heard at the expense of Native Americans. Con-
sumers like what many of these writers have to tell
them and do not want to be concerned with the facts
presented by Native Americans. Our voices are si-
lenced as a result. Consequently, the younger genera-
tion of Indians who are trying to find their way back NWSA's Indigenous and Native
