The inventory system is the center of the store’s we can count them as part of the community in the
ability to function. The success of the store depends on community bookstore and honor what they give us,
how well we interact with the cards. (The cards seem thein mmaybe pit woon't rbe sto haard n to sete t.he car ds O as
like abstractions but they stand for the book, so when
the card is misfiled, the book can be effectively lost.)
My feeling is that we need to value what we do
here. When the negatives pile up in my mind, I try to
think about why I keep showing up for work. To me,
our books are like the stories, the life experience and
stories of a tribe (Judy Grahn thinks of the lesbian/ gay
community as a tribe) and without these stories we
have no tribe because it is through the stories and
legends and folklore that a community knows itself.
How much richness could our community claim with-
out Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich telling us stories
and giving us courage? Not all of the books in this
store mean something to me personally but I know
they mean something to someone.
This probably seems incredibly corny, but the way
we treat the cards can show our respect for the writers
of our community who “give to the community its
speech” and its self- awareness. The political work we
do has meaning to the extent that we know who weare.
We're protecting our rights, or attempting to by fight-
ing for them, but who are “we?” I think we'll be search-
ing for the answers our whole lives, but I feel sure that
there are some powerful, healing books on our shelves
that help people search within for their answers.

In the course of discussing the article on Indian Spiritual Abuse at Feminist Bookstore
Day (see August FBN, pg. 35-39) Theresa Corrigan (Lioness Bookstore/Sacramento) spoke
of hearing Chrystos (Not Vanishing) read an early version of “Shame On!” (then subtitled
“There Are Many Forms of Genocide and This Is One”) and wanting to post it in her store
as a way to both express her concern and to raise the issue to customers in a way that
would empower them. FBN publishes the poem here as part of this continuing discussion
among booksellers.
Press Gang (inspired by booksellers’ requests following the Feminist Bookstore Day discussion)
has published “Shame On!” as a broadside and will be mailing copies to bookstores in
December. Additional copies of the broadside may be ordered direct from Press Gang. -CS O

Kate Millett’s
Sita
The Classic Lesbian Romance
Kate Millett has always loved ‘playing store.’ She
started out in coke bottles at five and stood treats
for the neighborhood kids. For years she’s sold her
art posters to women for preposterous prices (five
to fifty dollars) and her hand-pulled numbered
editions of silkscreens for democratic ones (one
hundred dollars). You can write to her about them
at 295 Bowery, NYC, 10003
Now she has another bee in her bonnet.
When Farrar Stauss remaindered those beautiful hard cover copies of Sita with Kate’s own
drawing on the cover, she said, why not, they’re mine — and bought them up herself. This
year she got the rights back so that Ballantine couldn’t publish any more of its ugly little
paperback and now, as they used to say back home, she’s cornered the market.
And she’s selling these autographed hard cover first
editions of Sita at a discount. For $10.00 each (postage and handling included) to individuals
and to bookstores, she’s offering them for $125.00 for a box of twenty-five— that’s $5.00 each
for a hardcover book whose front flap price was $10.00 then and would be $17.00 now. She
wants you to pay the UPS charge. If you’re out of New York State, there is no sales tax.
This is a deal, she says, and she’s gearing up for your
order. Don’t worry, she’s got a lot of books. It’s all part of her “little red hen does it herself”
theory: women taking things into their own hands and writers taking charge of their lives. She’s
probably right — go for it.
$125 per box of 25 copies.

But Can She Type?
By Nett Hart sation was productive enough to share. We're not
claiming insight as much as validating the things most
Awareness of the devastating impact of modern of us do anyhow.
human culture on the environment has finally cap-
tured great numbers of people’s attention. Alarmists
posit back-to-the-cave as an alternative to an increas-
ingly technologized world. To maintain the standard
of living to which we are accustomed, it is necessary
to reduce, reuse, and recycle materials because surely
we do not wish to significantly change our way of life,
we are told. The ruling philosophy is to keep order
and values as they are at all costs. The new 3 R's
(reduce, reuse and recycle) are unwelcome by neces-
sary accommodation for the maintenance of capitalist
patriarchy.
Essentially feminism is fully compatible with
earth conscious living. When we think of feminism in
its broadest ideological base, we encounter a world of
value where the significance of everything to the
whole is understood. Feminism would restore to
women the power to choose a way of living that
respects not only the lives of women, but life. This
compatibility, or the inclusion of ecology within fem-
inism, puts feminist booksellers and publishers in a
position to examine the relationship between our
business practices and values.
I discussed with Jennie Boyd Bull of the 31st
Street Bookstore our shared concern for the environ-
ment. As a bookseller, she was concerned not to re-
ceive styrofoam ghosts as packing materials. As a

them that we were interested in women and would be
interested in women well into the future. Then we
would finish our business and they would go away
and come back the next year and tell us the same thing
all over again. Last year at ABA I went around, and I
tried to bait people to tell me that the market for
women’s books was over. No one would rise to the bait!
They all know there's a market for women’s books,
and they know that all they have to dois publish good
books and they sell. Someone at Harper & Row/San
Francisco told me that women’s books are the easiest
books (to sell) that they publish. All they have to do is
publish them, and then this market just sort of absorbs
them. They hardly promote them and the books sell
wonderfully. So that’s all going on...

C: Right. We've gone from that label and we've ex-

Welcome to the Home of Your Heart
Simply profound quotes from Jenny
“Now is a time to vision new dreams of what it
means to be alive. . . . Now is the time to open
yourselves to all you can be, to all you can
create, to all you can truly achieve. You are only
shells of what you can be. You all can be much
greater than you are now. Dream this dream.
The change will come slowly at first, and then
faster and faster as the dream spreads.”
“Let me enter your heart. Do not hide from me. It
is safe. Open yourself. Let my light shine down
upon you. Let me cradle your soul in my arms
and bring sweet peace to you.”
“Believe what you will. Let these words inform
you whether you believe they come from me,
from universal mind or from a part of you. You
see this is not so necessary to ask, ‘Whois writing
this?’ as to ask, ‘Does this sound like truth?’”
“I am here. Welcome to the home of your heart.
Tonight I shall answer your questions and then
tell you more.”
MAbout Dorothy “Mike” Brinkman
When Dorothy “Mike” Brinkman, a mature, practical, somewhat skeptical social worker and a member
of the women’s community in a large, midwestern city, began to experiment with automatic writing
(channeling), she was very surprised by the messages she received. The writings were simple and
profound and, ultimately, simply profound. Through “Mike,” Jenny speaks to human problems with
universal love, caring and compassion. She also offers wonderful and useful meditations and blessings.
This is a significantly comforting and healing book.

Kaahumanu, trade paper, $11.95.
Hear the voices of over seventy bisexual women and men from all walks of life describe their
lives. This ground-breaking feminist anthology is an important step in recognizing that
bisexuals are a part of and apart from, the lesbian, gay, and heterosexual communities.
Bisexual people of all colors tell their stories — personal, political, spiritual, historical — in
prose, poetry, and essays. The range of their experience is astounding: single and married;
gay, lesbian, and feminist-identified; monogamous and non-monogamous; people with HIV;
parent and grandparents; sex radicals and swingers. These are individuals who have
withstood prejudice from both the gay and straight communities and who have begun only
recently to share their experiences. ISBN 1-55583-174-5

STAYING POWER:
Long Term Lesbian Couples
Y by SUSAN E. JOHNSON ,
This galle best seller!
The Naiad Press is proud to present the
first nationwide study of long term lesbian
couples.
The study group is women who have
been together ten years or more. Seven
couples are profiled in depth, from Pat and
Anna, together for 52 years, to Deborah
and Kathy, together 13 years.
You will learn the nature of commitment
for these couples, what they have in
common, their differences. Sexuality:
frequency, quality and quantity; the
question of monogamy. The time they
spend together and apart, outside interests
and friendships, their income inequities,
class and age differences, the issues of power and equality. You will learn
what has most severely tested the relationships, and helped sustain them.
And finally, in its conclusions, you will see what this study means to you.

Feminist Bookstore Sliding Scale
FBN is and has always been on a sliding scale for women’s bookstores: Larger stores doing a higher volume of business
help to subsidize FBN for small stores. The suggested range is $150 for stores doing $350,000, $125 for stores doing $300,000,
$100 for $250,000, $75 for $200,000, $50 for stores doing $100,000, $40 for stores doing $75,000, and $15 to $40 for stores
doing less than $75,000. (You decide, you know what you can afford!) Stores in extreme financial difficulty: Please tell us.
We'd far rather send you FBN for what you can afford than cut you off because we haven't heard from you!
If you renew for two years, please keep the sliding scale in mind.
Thanks to all of you for your commitment to this system over the years. It continues to keep FBN alive and healthy and
to get FBN to the stores that need the information the most!
