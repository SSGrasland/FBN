0-8165-1078-4,Navajo Textiles: The William Randolph Hearst Collection,"Blomberg, Nancy J.",University of Arizona Press,257.0,1988-07-01,"Publishers - News & Media Biography, Native North American Peoples - Art & Artifacts, Textiles & Textile Design, 19th Century American History - Biography",Hardcover,"<p>William Randolph Hearst's collection of Navajo textiles is one of the most complete gatherings of nineteenth-century Navajo weaving in the world. Comprising dozens of Classic Period serapes, chief blankets, Germantown eyedazzlers, and turn-of-the-century rugs, the 185-piece collection was donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History in 1942 but for the next forty years was known only to a handful of scholars. Hearst began acquiring textiles from the Fred Harvey Company after viewing an exhibit of Indian artifacts. Over four decades he amassed a collection spanning more than a century of Navajo weaving and including nearly every major type produced from 1800 to 1920. Hearst's passion for American Indian artifacts was so strong that he had originally visualized his now-famous castle in San Simeon as a showplace for his Navajo textile collection. At a time when the Harvey Company was itself influencing the development of Indian handcrafts by opening up the tourist market, Hearst contributed to this influence by expressing his own artistic preference for rare and unusual pieces. This catalogue raisonnÃ©, featuring nearly 200 illustrations, provides the general public with the first look at this important collection. Nancy Blomberg's narrative introduces the reader to the history of Navajo weaving and documents Hearst's role in its development. The heart of the book provides a detailed analysis of each textile: fibers, yarn types, dyes, and designs. Navajo Textiles thus constitutes an invaluable reference for scholars and collectors and will be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates these beautiful creations from the Navajo loom.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 1.2 Inches, Length: 11.3 Inches, Weight: 3.65 Pounds, Width: 9 Inches",15.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/88/9780816510788.jpg,Success,77.0,13.3

Enter her world, look at her pictures, and watch her stories grow and grow. You will never forget her.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The creator of A Chair for My Mother, Something Special for Me and other stories for children introduces us to another irresistible heroine. Bedemmi loves to draw pictures with colored markers and write stories that always start ``with the word THIS.'' Exquisitely decorated and deceptively simple, the book alternates between the narrator's spare descriptions and evocative watercolors, and Bedemmi's own captivating tales and vivid, imaginative drawings. The book's title refers to Bedemmi's storiesall of which involve folks ``eating cherries and spitting out the pits, eating cherries and spitting out the pits.'' What about all those pits? Bedemmi has an ``important plan.'' She will plant them in her yard so they will grow ``until there is a whole forest of cherry trees right on our block.'' Williams's latest work is another glowing tale of the transformational power of a child's creativity and love.

Possessing a keen eye and a ready humor, she recounts traveling on airplanes that run ``more by luck and whimsy than by science'' and trains that cover 75 miles in 8 hours. A veteran of the ``Dylan and Lennon sixties' version'' of Marxism, she's dismayed to learn that Chinese society isn't classless and that communism is only the veneer over an older ``red'' system--bureaucratic red tape. At a Shakespeare festival, The Winter's Tale is rendered as traditional Shaoxing opera in which women take all the roles, and Macbeth gains a new character: a stuffed parrot that talks. As for the place of women, James is assured that ``there is a Chinese word for feminism . . . but the men don't know it.'' p. 111 James teaches Kerouac over a culture gap, asking students what they would do with a car and the open highway stretching out before them; one answers that she'd sit in the car and think about it for a week.
