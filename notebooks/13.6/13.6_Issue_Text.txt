“LOVING THE GODDESS WITHIN: SEX
MAGICK FOR WOMEN offers a much needed
celebration of sacred sexuality and love, includ-
ing the often neglected subject of self-love.
With her unique blend of practical down to
Earth suggestions and deep love of the Goddess
and Her ways, Nan Hawthorne has written a
book that should be part of every spiritual
woman's collection. LOVING THE GODDESS
WITHIN is one of the very best books I have
read on creating your sense of self-esteem and
taking pleasure in your Earthly form. Highly
recommended!”
Lunaea Weatherstone, Sage Woman Magazine
“A beautifully written tribute to the re-emerging
Goddess, and to the women who embody Her.
Affirmative of all that has been denied: the life-
force inherent in our physical bodies, the erotic,
the passionate, and the power and beauty that is woman and the Goddess brought forth
through the sacred arts of dance and drama, sex and celebration, myth and imagination.
Magically accurate, ritually delightful.”

Calling Rain
by Karen Marie Christa Minns
From the author of the haunting Virago...
Primatologist Darrian Stone has made the find of the century.
She has located the legendary Big Foot — the Sasquatch. To
protect the trust these shy, gentle creatures have in her, she
guards the research project with uncompromising ferocity.
Nikki, compelled by her vision of a woman she has seen
only in film and photograph, is determined to endure any
hardship to be part of the Great Apes Project, to be with Darrian.
As Nikki struggles to earn a place among the Great Apes,
she uncovers an erotic passion in Darrian Stone that fully
matches the legend of the woman.
The pressures increase — from a ruthlessly intrusive press,
politicians, even the scientific community, until Nikki is called upon to make an ultimate
act of love and allegiance . .….
Calling Rain is a stunning tale of passion — and of loyalty to the best in ourselves and
the preservation of our world. ISBN 0-941483-87-8 $9.95
Black Iris BLAKKS
by Jeane Harris
To all appearances, university professor Caroline Jordan leads
a fulfilled life. No one suspects her deepest, darkest secret —
the monster who is Gerald Louis Steckman.
Steckman, imprisioned for the brutal rape of Caroline, has
been released and is back in Denver, wreaking homicidal horror
as he stalks Caroline once again.
But. the gay community of Denver, especially its women,
have banded together to find him. Caroline is determined that
she will never again be a passive victim. She intends to find A Novel By

this revised and expanded volume is being published. Not only is the original poetry here, we've added more
work from each author and put it together with photographs of both women. Postponed from 1990.
