This is not to say that a utopian workplace is portrayed herein. Exploitation has not been eradicated; equal pay is still the goal, not the reality. Work can often be boring and unfulfilling.<p>But women here are not victims. These are strong women -- survivors. They set boundaries, take risks, demand respect, and maintain their self-esteem, with or without the help of management, coworkers, family or friends. And they do it with a sense of humor! In traditional and nontraditional jobs, at home and in the workplace, these women are using their power to take charge of their own lives, challenging each of us to do the same.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This collection, conceived to broadly address the subject of women's work, focuses mainly on women in dead-end jobs struggling to make ends meet, with little hope of finding fulfilling employment opportunities. In Candida Lawrence's witty tale, ``Spotter,'' for example, Alice labors as a cashier at an amusement park, demeaned by her overzealous boss and the ridiculous uniform she must wear. Nevertheless, several of the stories here are noteworthy for their uncompromising portrayals of women fighting to gain respect and financial security in various work milieus, particularly Karen Loeb's ``Machines,'' Barbara Unger's ``Search Committee'' and Virginia Rudasill Mortenson's ``Hideaway Inn.'' Overall, the poetry tends to be amateurish and cliched. Kate Braid's ``These Hips'' is spoken by a female contractor whose ``strong hips are built for the birth of buildings,'' and Leslea Newman's ``Ode to Secretaries of America'' urges women to ``get up off their chairs and take a walk in the sun.'' The photographs are unexciting representations of women going about their everyday work routines. Martz is editor of Papier-Mache Press.

Cast out and divorced by her husband, she finds herself in a strange new world. Both obstacles and support systems change as she actively participates in the struggle for Moroccan independence from France.<p>This feminist novel is a literary statement in a modern realist style. Many novels by women of the Middle East that have been translated reflect Western views, values, and education. By contrast, <i>Year of the Elephant</i> is uniquely Moroccan and emerges from North African Islamic culture itself. Its subtle juxtaposition of past and present, of immediate thought and triggered memory, reflects the heroine's interior conflict between tradition and modern demands.

Faderman Uses Journals, Unpublished Manuscripts, Songs, News Accounts, Novels, Medical Literature, And Numerous Personal Interviews With Lesbians Of All Races, Ages, And Classes, To Uncover And Relate This Often Surprising Narrative Of Lesbian Life In America. Lesbian Identity Could Emerge, Faderman Maintains, Only During That Time, With The Sexual Freedom Of The 1920s And The 1960s, As Well As The Social Freedom Made Possible By World War Ii, The Education Of Women, And The Civil Rights And Women's Movements. The Term Lesbian Did Not Become Current Until The Late Nineteenth Century, When European Sexologists Began To Explore Female Same-sex Loving. Where Close Relationships Between Women Had Once Been Accepted--even Encouraged--the Sexologists Stigmatized Same-sex Pairing As Deviant, But At The Same Time Fostered A Lesbian Consciousness Which Was Necessary Before Lesbian Communities Could Be Formed.
