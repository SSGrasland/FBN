For decades, women have succeeded at traditional male jobs, but now, deep in the second stage of the feminist movement, they want lives that are integrated and whole. Based on original research and containing hundreds of interviews with prominent working women, this audiobook exposes the inherent conflict between the way work is traditionally structured and rewarded, and what women desire and value in their lives. More important, it suggests new ways for women to identify their values, reclaim their identities, and define success on their own terms. Any woman who has been working for more than a few years will identify strongly with the issues raised here, and will be rewarded by the insights she will glean from this insightful work.",en,,"Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/48/9780553477948.jpg,Success,45.0,20.3

Their life is a prolonged party - traveling to Europe, cruising the Mediterranean in yachts, meeting all the famous people of the day - until Perry's wife discovers the real relationship between her husband and her father.

As Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Public Policy Issues examines the role of radical religious thought in American politics, it looks at the development of conflicts on the national level over the four main issues. It also looks at specific examples of the conflicts, such as the “Rainbow Curriculum” battle in New York City and the controversial school board elections in Des Moines.
<p>This insightful and comprehensive book discusses recent successes of the gay and lesbian movement in the development of local public policy as well as setbacks it has experienced. From election year gay-bashing to the persecution of gay and lesbian youth in school environments to lack of protection for gay and lesbian employees in the workplace, it is clear that much work remains to be done before the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered persons are protected to the same degree as those of heterosexual persons. Gay or straight, you will find your eyes truly opened as you read about:</p>
<ul>
<li>discrimination against gay and lesbian people by the American system of justice</li>
<li>congressional indifference to workplace oppression</li>
<li>the origins and aims of the religious right</li>
<li>the development of services to meet the needs of gay youths in the school environment</li>
<li>the major confrontations administrators face when dealing with sexual orientation issues</li>
<li>homelessness from a gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered point of view</li>
<li>gay and lesbian role models and multicultural activities for adolescents
<p>Citizens, public administrators, policymakers, educational administrators, social service providers, and teachers need to read Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Public Policy Issues to understand how members of the gay community remain disenfranchised in American society. You may think you are sensitive to the issues, but are you helping to find solutions? Get this book and find out!</p>

In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love—and all of love's nasty fallout—anyway.</p>
<p>But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core—not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean—and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it.</p>
<p> Told in Stella's own exuberant, dead-on, dead honest voice, <b>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</b> is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life—and what she must risk to do it.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",7.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/04/9780451192004.jpg,Success,116.0,20.3

This is the question that Kathleen Norris herself asks as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at a Benedictine monastery.

Here is such a novel by Jean Hegland, an extraordinary fiction debut...<i>Into the Forest.</i> <br>
Eva, eighteen, and Nell, seventeen, are sisters, adolescents on the threshold of womanhood--and for them anything should be possible. But even as Eva prepares for an audition with the San Francisco Ballet and Nell dreams of her first semester at Harvard, their lives are turned upside down and their dreams are pushed into the shadows. In a nation suddenly without electricity or communications, Eva is compelled to dance alone to the music of memory, and Nell's education consists of reading the encyclopedia, devouring knowledge as if it were her last meal. Theirs is an age of darkness and terror. <br>
A distant war rages overseas. Resources society had depended on, such as gas and electricity, are no longer available. Riots spread through the inner cities, while deadly viral infections spread across the countryside. Isolated in their home in the northern California woods, Eva and Nell live in a world without television or phones, in a time of suspicion and superstition, of anger, hunger, and fear. Perhaps one day the lights--and their dreams--will return, but orphaned by their parents' deaths and by society, Eva and Nell have been left to forage through the forest, and through their past, for the keys to survival. As they blaze a path into the forest and into the future, they become pioneers and pilgrims--not only creatures of the new world, but the creators of it. <br>
<i>Into the Forest</i> is the gripping, unforgettable story ofthese remarkable sisters as they struggle to redefine themselves and their life together. It is a passionate and poignant tale of stirring sensuality, chilling insight, and profound inspiration--a novel that will move you and surprise you and touch you to the core. <br>

Revealing the harsh price of unfulfilled longings and the healing power of mystery and hope, <i>The Grass Dancer</i> takes readers on a journey through past and present-in a tale as resonant and haunting as an ancestor's memory, and as promising as a child's dream.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A major talent debuts with this beguiling novel whose characters are Dakota Sioux and their spirit ancestors. Covering some of the same themes as Louise Erdrich but displaying her own distinctive voice and transcendent imagination, Power has produced an authentic portrait of Native American culture and characters who are as resilient and tangible as the grass moving over the Great Plains. In interconnected stories that begin in 1981 and range back to 1864, the residents of a Sioux reservation endure poverty, epidemic illness, injustice and--no less importantly--jealousy, greed, anger and unrequited love. The tales begin and end with Harley Wind Soldier, a 17-year-old whose soul is a ``black, empty hole'' because his mother has not spoken a word since the accident 17 years earlier in which Harley's father and brother died. Eventually we discover the true circumstances surrounding that event and other secrets--of clandestine love affairs, of childrens' paternity--that stretch back several generations but hold a grip on the present. Meanwhile, Harley falls in love with enchanting Pumpkin, an amazingly adept grass dancer whose fate will make readers gasp. Mercury Thunder and her daughter Anna use magic in a sinister way, and tragedy results. Herod Small War, a Yuwipi (interpreter of dreams), tries to bring his community into harmony with the spiritual world. The existence of ghosts in the real world is accepted with calm belief by the characters, who know the old legends and understand that the direction of their lives is determined by their gods and ancestors. Power weaves historical events--the Apollo Moon landing; the 19th-century Great Plains drought--into her narrative, reinforcing the seamless coexistence of the real and the spirit realm. A consummate storyteller whose graceful prose is plangent with lyrical metaphor and sensuous detail, she deftly uses suspense, humor, irony and the gradual revelation of dramatic disclosures to compose a tapestry of human life.

<p>It is often said that the best comedy springs from hard times.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rita Mae Brown has seen plenty of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this irresistibly readable memoir, she recounts the drama of her birth as the illegitimate daughter of a flighty blue blood who left her in an orphanage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sickly baby was quickly rescued by relatives eager to adopt her but afraid she would not survive the long journey home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her determination to live, and shock everyone by doing it, has become a metaphor for her entire life.</p>
<p>Though raised by these loving adoptive parents and a wacky host of other interfering kin, Rita Mae Brown learned early on to be tough and to speak her mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was her refusal to be anything but herself that often brought her the most trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here she tells of her tempestuous relationship with her adoptive mother, the mythic Juts of the novels <i>Six of One</i> and <i>Bingo,</i> who called her ""the ill,"" for illegitimate, whenever she lost her temper, and who swore she'd introduce Rita Mae to the social graces, including the dreaded cotillion, even if it killed them both.</p>
<p>Here, too, Rita Mae reveals how her headstrong support of social causes almost cost her a hard-earned education and her outspokenness in the early days of the women's movement got her drummed out of NOW, and how the release of her first novel, the scandalous classic <i>Rubyfruit Jungle,</i> made her an overnight phenomenon--the most famous openly gay person in America--and took her from the heights of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list to the surreal playhouse that is Hollywood.</p>
<p>Through it all, Rita Mae has drawn strength from her profound bond with animals, from her abiding affection for the South and its native tongue, and from the great passions of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;She writes with close-to-the-bone honesty about woman-woman love...including her love-at-first-sight relationship with a popular actor and her headline-making romance with tennis great Martina Navratilova.&nbsp;&nbsp;With her trademark humor, she unflinchingly bares her own flaws, flouting public opinion yet displaying the unflappable good sense that shows through everything she writes.</p>
<p>A look into a woman's mind and a writer's irrepressible spirit, <i>Rita Will</i> is quintessential Rita Mae Brown--a book that feels like a kick-your-shoes-off visit with an old friend.</p>

Now a drunken encounter with the midnight train has left brash, much-married Jo-Nell near death, compelling agoraphobic Eleanor to summon marine biologist Freddie home from California&#8212where she fled after being expelled from med school following a daring gall bladder heist. At last the McBroom sisters are together again, to face old fears and new catastrophes as they cheerfully deflect every flaming arrow that outrageous fortune fires their way. <P>With wit and loving compassion, Michael Lee West introduces us to an indomitable family of eccentric survivors in an unforgettable novel of cruel fate, bad luck, and unassailable resiliency.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Southern gothic and soap-opera hype collide exuberantly in West's vivid if hokey third novel (She Flew the Coop, 1994, etc.)&#58; a tale of three sisters and their plucky Grandma fighting to dispel a family curse in a small Tennessee town.<P>When Jo-Nell, the youngest of the three McBroom sisters, is near death as the result of a train accident, the family thinks it's just another manifestation of the curse that has dogged them for three generations. Originally from Texas, most of the McBrooms now live in Tallulah, Tennessee, where everybody knows everybody else's business. Freddie, the middle sister, left Tallulah and headed for California after being expelled from medical school; now, she interrupts a whale-watching visit to Baja, Mexico, with fellow scientist-husband Sam to fly to Jo-Nell's bedside. Grandma Minerva, meanwhile, fears that the old family curse has been revived. Eleanor, the eldest, is so obsessed with crime that she cannot go out alone, and picks up widows from the Senior Citizen Center before she drives to the store. As the four women alternate recollections of the past with accounts of what happens when they're all together again, the plot moves at a hyperventilating pace. Minerva recalls her Texas childhood, her marriage, the tragic deaths of two of her children, the move to Tallulah, where&#151;such is the power of the curse&#151;husband Amos dies and daughter Ruth marries Freddie McBroom, is widowed, marries again only to be abandoned, then commits suicide. Jo-Nell, regarded locally as a slut, has also been unlucky in love; and Freddie finds herself still attracted to her own first love, Jackson, a pediatrician with a similarly checkered family history. When Minerva dies, the sisters, having finally faced the past, are ready to move on.<P> Colorful, larger-than-life characters strut and stew with zest across an equally colorful terrain&#151;in a tale that grips in spite of itself.<P></p>",en,HarperPerennial ed,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 0.76 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 5.31 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/35/9780060984335.jpg,Success,111.0,20.3

1-56023-090-8,Activism and Marginalization in the AIDS Crisis (Research on Homosexuality Series),"Hallett, Michael A",Routledge,218.0,1997-04-25,,Paperback,"<p>Activism and Marginalization in the AIDS Crisis shows readers how the advent of HIV-disease has brought into question the utility of certain forms of “activism” as they relate to understanding and fighting the social impacts of disease. This informative and powerful book is centrally concerned about the ways in which institutionally governed social constructions of HIV/AIDS affect policy and public images of the disease more so than activist efforts. It asserts that an accounting of the power institutional structures have over the dominant social constructions of HIV disease is fundamental to adequate forms of present and future AIDS activism.</p>
<p>Chapters in Activism and Marginalization in the AIDS Crisis demonstrate how, despite what is thought of as the “successful activism” of the past decade, the claims of the HIV-positive are still being ignored, still being marginalized, and still being administratively “handled” and exploited even as the plight of those who find themselves HIV-positive worsens. Although chapters reject the assertion that activism has been a highly effective remedy to HIV-positive voicelessness, authors do not deny that activists have been vocal, but that they continue to be ignored despite their vocality.</p>
<p>Contributors in Activism and Marginalization in the AIDS Crisis offer numerous examples of institutional control and demonstrate that institutional structures, and not activists, are controlling the public meaning of HIV-related issues. Readers learn how messages about HIV/AIDS are produced, negotiated, modified, and sustained through institutional mechanisms that serve mostly institutional interests rather than those of the HIV-positive. In gaining an understanding of these issues, readers will begin to learn how to modify and strengthen activist efforts with valuable insight on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lack of HIV-positive voices in mainstream news portrayals of HIV/AIDS</li>
<li>research on constructions of HIV-disease at the state government level</li>
<li>social constructions and how they affect HIV/AIDS policy</li>
<li>the political construction of AIDS and interest-based struggles</li>
<li>the emergent “bio-politics” of HIV and homosexuality in the U.S.</li>
<li>how institutional power works to govern public understanding of HIV disease
<p>Institutional structures are defined in this book as groups engaged in and defined by the production of various “truths” which sustain them. Institutional power may be defined as the capacity to regulate, constrain, and disseminate versions of “truth.” Activism and Marginalization in the AIDS Crisis reveals how HIV activist groups have been outmaneuvered when it comes to the production and dissemination of various “truths” about HIV/AIDS by institutional structures more deeply steeped in social legitimacy and which have a superior capacity for message dissemination.</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS activists, HIV-positive persons and those with AIDS, HIV/AIDS educators, public and institutional policymakers, health professionals, and the general public will find this book essential to understanding the social constructions of HIV/AIDS, how these affect HIV/AIDS-related policy and public opinion, and how to begin to cipher through the plethora of information to find and promote the “truth.”</p>

She is unable to remember what has happened or who she is. Gradually, Anna begins to recover tender but painful memories of her Italian American, working-class childhood, of her escape through education, and of her years devoted to teaching.

With virtually unlimited access to Farleigh's wallet, pool, and imported cars, he couldn't possibly be better situated. Until Farleigh, after weeks of remaining conspicuously cold and aloof, drops the big one, the unthinkable, the horror of horrors: Dennis must get a job. Dennis believes there can be only one explanation for this outrage: he's let himself go. And as any kept boy worth his gym membership knows, a spare tire can run right over a relationship. Alas, even after a crash course in iron pumping with an albino Amazon, his situation only worsens. First, he discovers that he's unemployable virtually anywhere on the planet. Then he learns that his old career is in jeopardy as well, for Farleigh's affections have been snared by the lithe young pool boy Jasper Batton. When Jasper is promoted from chlorination duties to directing Farleigh's production of Lady Windermere's Fan, Dennis panics; he's in danger of losing not only his position as Farleigh's house hunk, but also his place in Farleigh's last will and testament. Desperate for a way up from this devastating downfall, Dennis turns to his best friends: Lonnie Roach, the kept man of ancient gossip columnist Dierdre Diamon, and Paulette Ng, the kept woman of a member of Congress whose anonymity she protects by referring to him only as ""the Spanker of the House."" Together, the three devise a cunning plan to whisk Farleigh away to the romantic Greek Isles, where Dennis hopes to re-seduce him. But the warm Hellenic breeze stirs up more trouble than magic, and Dennis, with only a pair of Iowa coeds for allies, must wage one final, desperate campaign to keep Farleigh's love, battling everything from stampeding goats to a deranged Santorini grandmother.",en,,"Height: 7.95274 Inches, Length: 7.24408 Inches, Weight: 0.6393405598 Pounds, Width: 0.86614 Inches",14.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/50/9780452273450.jpg,Success,58.0,20.3

Her personal life has been dedicated to a series of meaningless affairs - Lindsay simply doesn't have the time for anything more. No one is more surprised than Lindsay, therefore, when a beach house renovation she undertakes for interior designer Sondra Pinchot leads to an awakening of emotions that she had assumed were permanently dormant, as she finds herself drawn to the older divorcee, whose open, fragile nature stands in stark contrast to her own masked restraint. Perhaps it is inevitable, then, that later, when she and Sondra are hired jointly to complete the construction and design of an arts center, they acknowledge their mutual attraction. For Lindsay, it is an unexpected but not totally unwelcome adventure. For Sondra, who has all her adult life waged a losing battle with the bottle, and who as a result is basically estranged from her daughter Samantha, her headlong dive into forbidden love marks her return to old, destructive habits as her sobriety crumbles. So once again it is Samantha who is called in to clean up the mess her mother has made of her life, a role she has undertaken since she was a child. Temporarily leaving her own design business in Seattle, she places her mother in treatment, puts a hold on a stagnating relationship she has had with the same man for five years, and takes over for her mother by joining Lindsay in attempting to meet the completion date for the arts center project. Samantha and Lindsay begin to find themselves slipping into an unpredictable vortex of emotions, as they enter the shadow of a dangerous triangle in which love and anger meet and collide, igniting a passion so powerful that it threatens to consume them all.",en,,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",5.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/43/9780425156643.jpg,Success,109.0,20.3

When the peasants are deprived of fields to work, so goes the chorus of an old Irish ballad, ""All that's left is a love of the land."" In this exquisite rendering of her childhood in rural Oklahoma, from the Dust Bowl days to the end of the Eisenhower era, writer and journalist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz bears witness to a family and community that still clings to the dream of America as a republic of landowners. Drawing deeply on the stories, often biblical parables, she heard in her early years, Dunbar-Ortiz brings to life one of the least understood groups in US history: poor rural whites. They are the backbone of the national campaigns against abortion and for prayer in school. They are also the soldiers of the militia movement and the members of a group who will come to trial this spring for the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building.

The fact is, there is nothing wrong with today's working women.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something wrong with today's work culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in a structure designed for a different generation of men who had wives at home to take care of life outside the office, today's working woman struggles to meet two opposing sets of demands and expectations -- professional and personal -- and two opposing equations for success -- as a feminine woman and as a valued worker.&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, she can't win.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of her attempts to do so is a crisis of values, not lifestyles: the question is not one of work vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;home, but, rather, what price are women paying to ""fit in"" with a culture that does not share their values or respond to their needs. <br>
Enter Elizabeth Perle McKenna.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her groundbreaking and timely new book <i>When Work Doesn't Work Anymore: Women, Work, and Identity,</i> McKenna draws on interviews with hundreds of women--from housewives to CEOs to such familiar and respected women as Gloria Steinem, AnnaQuindlen, and Letty Cottin Pogrebin--to illustrate the deep rift in the lives of many of today's working women, and the critical need for a new professional culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;McKenna shatters the myth of having it all, and shows that a life out of balance is never a path to success, but a profoundly dissatisfying route to unhappiness, self-doubt, and isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows from whence she speaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;McKenna spent eighteen years in the publishing profession, working her way up from the ground floor to the top of her field as associate publisher at Bantam and publisher at Prentice-Hall, Addison-Wesley, and William Morrow/Avon Books.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of her success, she realized her work wasn't working for her anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of success to the rest of her life was steep.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was miserable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling she had to make a choice between her life and her work, she left Morrow and, without her work identity, everything fell apart. <br>
Through her own and hundreds of other women's experience, McKenna shows that women ""stopped the revolution too soon.""&nbsp;&nbsp;They may have approached parity in the work world but they've stopped short of changing a culture utterly at odds with the realities of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>When Work Doesn't Work Anymore</i> examines women's complex relationships with their work--both through their need and desire to work, and the cost to their lives of doing so--and urges them to bring their values of home and family, friendship, community, and meaning to the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise and provocative, McKenna encourages women to reassess and change a work culture that has never fully embraced the way they live, to seek a balance between professional and private spheres, and to strive for more integrated lives by recognizing the importance of building lives around personal value systems. <br>
With wit, insight, and fierce intellect, Elizabeth Perle McKenna has written an enormously important book that will pave the way for transforming the workplace into one where women can lead more satisfying lives -- and be happier, more productive employees.",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/55/9780385317955.jpg,Success,107.0,20.3

Despite the rewards of marriage and mothering, Gould found herself plagued by a deepening sense that ""something was missing."" For Gould this feeling was not an epitaph but an inspiration-the beginning of a personal, political, and professional journey that would help to transform women's lives and earn her a permanent place in contemporary women's history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First at the Alumnae Advisory Center and then as director of the Barnard Placement and Career Planning Office, Gould helped to reshape perceptions about women and work. A pioneer in the middle-class return-to-work movement, she established women's career networks and developed programs to help women define their personal and professional goals and negotiate-or ""juggle""-the demands of career and family. She brought to these challenges a compassion born of personal experience, as she struggled to balance her increasingly absorbing work with heavy family responsibilities and worked to find a stonger sense of self amid persistent feelings of fear, inadequacy, and ""unbelonging.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gould's work propelled her into the growing women's movement: in the early 1970s, she became one of the founders and the first permanent director of the Barnard Women's Center. From 1972 to 1983 she worked to open the Women's Center to feminist activism and to diverse communities and organized a groundbreaking series of conferences, The Scholar and the Feminist. Her rewarding but often tense relationship with Barnard-which she compares to a long ""love affair""-culminated with the explosive ""Towards a Politics of Sexuality"" conference, which reflected riveting conflicts within academe and the feminist movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told from the perspective of the author's seventy-eighth year, <i>Juggling</i> is both an empowering personal story of determination in the face of internal conflict and external limitation and a unique historical account. In recounting a life which both paralleled and propelled critical struggles within the women's movement, Gould's memoir documents the development of important ideas and social transformationsm, while candidly reflecting upon their impact on one woman's life and consciousness.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.87303055752 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/33/9781558611733.jpg,Success,70.0,20.3

Gay and Lesbian Professionals in the Closet explores the different positions people take on this provocative issue, the arguments they use to support their positions, and why the issue may not be as clear-cut as it sometimes seems.</p><p>While complex sociopsychological factors, cultural values and influences, and legal issues keep many gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the closet, closeted practice may have its advantages. A closeted practitioner, whether case manager, counselor, psychotherapist, physician, or minister, can bring understanding and insight to practice with homosexual clients and their families, as well as lend substantial support to openly gay and lesbian helping professionals. Yet, as Gay and Lesbian Professionals in the Closet reveals, being closeted can compromise your integrity, as well as that of your clients, and the benefits of being out will likely outweigh those of being closeted. Being out will help readers:</p><ul><li>counteract stereotypes of gays and lesbians</li><li>allow you to serve as a role model</li><li>improve the quality of care offered by traditionally homophobic, or homo-ignorant, institutions and employees</li><li>contribute to the establishment of affirming services and environments for both yourself and your clients</li><li>stop segregating your sexual life from the rest of your life</li><li>attain credibility with your clients</li><li>not feed repression through silence<p>As Gay and Lesbian Professionals in the Closet will show readers, it is always important to consider patientsâneeds and each work setting before coming out, but gay, lesbian, and bisexual social service providers should make decisions on a case-by-case basis, not avoid being out altogether. Being open in the workplace will remind caregivers, clients, and coworkers of the exemplary citizenship and service gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are capable of offering. Think again whether the closet carries protective cover from discrimination or tacit endorsement of homophobia.</p></li></ul>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.79807338844 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",88.93,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/17/9780789003317.jpg,Success,61.0,20.3

Besides surmounting the obstacles of being African American, poor and troubled by leg problems, probably from overparticipation in sports, Joyner-Kersee continues to face a far greater obstacle: severe asthma.

But for Jessie Lee, as for the nation, World War I put an end to those years of innocence. She lost her beloved fiance and mother in one year.

Then, as her husband sank deeper and deeper into alcoholism, she carried the brunt of raising them on her own - selling products door-to-door with her youngest children by her side, and fighting debt and dishonor with hard work and the loving help of family and friends. As time went on, and Jessie Lee broke with convention to find a job and get a divorce, she also found it in her heart to forgive the husband who had disappointed her, take responsibility for her own mistakes, and pass the insights of a long lifetime down to her children and grandchildren.

Providing a map of a complex terrain, Tobias details 'generations' of issues, each more radical and therefore harder to tackle than the ones before. She sets the story in two contexts: feminismâs own evolving strategies and Americaâs political landscape. Even though her passion for feminism remains, she is not unwilling to critique the sisterhood and herself for failing to see, for example, that not every woman would be a feminist nor every man an enemy. In the heady first years, feminists forgot that deeper even than gender is the liberal/conservative divide in American politics.From the origins of the movement through feminist theory and new scholarship on women, Tobias traces the political history of the second wave and its comeuppance at the hands of Phyllis Schaflyâs StopERA-coincidental with the nationâs careering toward the Right. Somehow, feminism survived the 1980s, but by having to fight brush fires throughout the Reagan-Bush presidencies, the movement lost some of its breadth and much of its taste for the mainstream. Because of her activism and her feeling for the period she chronicles, Tobias is at once inside and outside the issues of sexual preference, pornography, the draft, the Mommy Track, comparable worth, affirmative action, reproductive rights, and the challenges of equality versus difference.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.55 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/23/9780813328423.jpg,Success,113.0,20.3

You fetch his ashes South, back home to the rural conditions you long ago made your way away from in order to preserve your nature in the exquisite scandal of its difference. You inter the cremains in the very place most forbidden to you - within the severe boundaries your kin have devised for their own kind to be laid to rest. But your deed was done in secret, of course, and now you must return to the site of your trespass, a year thereafter, somehow helpless to do other than - at your very peril, at whatever the quality of the cost - make your infamy known. These are the terms that inaugurate the heroic prospect of this much-anticipated second novel, a work of superb innocence, of boundless charm, and of the durable - and liberating - love of one human being for another. Author of the widely heralded Where She Was, Anderson Ferrell gives us the spirituality of our wound where others would give us the pettishness of their injury. Here is an account confected from the plainest humility - and truth. Its ironies (none more delectable or more marvelous than what becomes the unguessable destiny of what was left of the deceased) and its sometimes colossal comedy (get set for the cautionary tale of the frog-infested washing machine bespeaking the wages of unfettered grief) come to seem the ordinary measure, and necessary redress, of gorgeously loving lives lived to the hilt.

Chicago initiated the largest mothers' pension program in the United States in 1911. Evolving alongside movements for industrial justice and women's suffrage, the mothers' pension movement hoped to provide ""justice for mothers"" and protection from life's insecurities. However, local politics and public finance derailed the policy, and most women were required to earn. Widows were more likely to receive pensions than deserted women and unwed mothers. And African-American mothers were routinely excluded because they were proven breadwinners yet did not compete with white men for jobs. Ultimately, the once-uniform commitment to protect motherhood faltered on the criteria of individual support, and wage-earning became a major component of the policy. 
<p>This revealing study shows how assumptions about women's roles have historically shaped public policy and sheds new light on the ongoing controversy of welfare reform.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 inches, Length: 6 inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.8 inches",27.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/32/9780226303932.jpg,Success,104.0,20.3

With these two powerful, provocative plays, Yew first brought his startling and poetic voice to stages across America and abroad, exploring the battlegrounds, both internal and external, where matters of the heart conflict with barriers of race and sexuality. Porcelain is an examination of a young man&#8217;s crime of passion. Triply scorned &#151; as an Asian, a homosexual, and now a murderer &#151; 19-year-old John Lee has confessed to shooting his lover in a public lavatory in London. A winner of the London Fringe Award for Best Play, Porcelain dissects the crime through a prism of conflicting voices&#58; newscasts, flashbacks, and John&#8217;s own recollections to a prison psychiatrist. A Language of Their Own is a lyrical and dramatic meditation on the nature of desire and sexuality as four men &#151; three Asian and one white &#151; come together and drift apart in a series of interconnected stories. A critical and popular success at New York&#8217;s Public Theater, it won both the George and Elisabeth Marton Playwriting Award and the GLAAD Media Award for Best Play.<p></p><h3>The Advocate - Cathay Che</h3><p>In <i>Language</i> and his first play, <i>Porcelain,</i> both included in this initial collection of his work, Yew brings a powerful gay presence to a world that has too often been distorted...Yew is savvy with regards to the stereotypes of race and sexual identity, but he refuses to play into or against them.

So says Michelle, a national bodybuilding judge. In fact, athletic women, especially those in sports where strength, muscle, and sweat feature prominently, are typically viewed by the public as being outside the boundaries of appropriate femininity. And perhaps no group of women athletes embodies this gender outlaw status more than female bodybuilders, who by their bulk and sheer strength challenge our very notions of what it means to be a woman. Why would women choose to look like that? And what does it take to get and stay so muscular?</p><p>Maria R. Lowe has interviewed more than one hundred people connected with women's bodybuilding, from the bodybuilders themselves, to trainers, family members, spouses, judges, and sponsors. In <b>Women of Steel</b>, Lowe introduces us to a world where size and strength must be balanced with a nod toward grace and femininity. Lowe, who actually worked out with a couple of the bodybuilders she interviewed, gets at the heart of what it is to be a woman bodybuilder. We learn about paying the price--doing the necessary exercise, and sometimes drugs--that allows women to rise to the top of their profession. We follow their successes and failures, and discover the benefits-- including increased self-esteem and physical strength--as well as the sometimes unhealthy effects of their training regimen, from dehydration to baldness to rampant acne to high blood pressure. We travel with the women from competition to competition and find that judges' standards seem to vary alarmingly depending on momentary notions of what constitutes the overall package--that elusive perfect body that catches judges' eyes and wins competitions.</p><p>Above all, <b>Women of Steel</b> is a keenly observant diary of life in women's bodybuilding, a must-read for people interested in sports, competition, physical culture, and gender.</p>",en,New Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.69004688006 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",21.12,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/40/9780814750940.jpg,Success,6.0,20.3

It centers on Marie Fermoyle, a strong but vulnerable woman whose loneliness and ambition for her children make her easy prey for the dangerous con man Omar Duvall. Marie's children are Alice, seventeen - involved with a troubled young priest; Norm, sixteen - hotheaded and idealistic; and Benjy, twelve - isolated and misunderstood, and so desperate for his mother's happiness that he hides the deadly truth only he knows about Duvall. Among a fascinating cast of characters we meet the children's alcoholic father, Sam Fermoyle, now living with his senile mother and embittered sister; Sam's meek brother-in-law, who makes anonymous ""love"" calls from the bathroom of his ailing appliance store; and the Klubock family, who - in complete contrast to the Fermoyles - live an orderly life in the perfect house next door.<br><br>An Oprah Winfrey Book Club pick.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>As she proved in her first novel, <I>Vanished</I>, and in the equally compelling <I>A Dangerous Woman</I>, Morris can depict society's outsiders-people with bleak presents and no futures-with rare understanding and compassion. Here, she portrays an entire community, a small town in Vermont during the summer of 1960, and then focuses on one family, the Fermoyles. With no support from her alcoholic ex-husband Sam, Marie Fermoyle has struggled for eight years to raise her three children. She is sharp-tongued, bitter, resentful and driven nearly to distraction by unending money worries and her own shame at being a poor divorce in a staunchly Catholic town. The arrival of mysterious Omar Duvall with his con man's spiel of sudden riches brings Marie hope that she can change her dead-end existence. Among the 30 or so characters, there are no happy people: in fact, at first, one thinks this will be just an unbroken litany of sour, wasted lives, people mired in frustration and desperation, hiding tawdry secrets. But, although the exposition is long and leisurely, one is soon caught in the web of Morris's narrative, particularly in Marie's manipulation by Duvall, who sponges off the family while appearing to offer Marie the love she desperately craves. Meanwhile, her children-teenaged Alice and Norm, and fearful 12-year-old Benjy-are out-matched by the oily Omar, and they undergo their own torments as adolescents shamed by their parents and miserably conscious of their poverty. Innocent Benjy holds a secret so terrible he doesn't even fathom it until it is almost too late to avert tragedy. Morris weaves the taut strands of her plot with remarkable skill, revealing how people with no financial security and few mental resources are controlled by others more feral and more dangerous. Throughout, she maintains the suspense triggered by a dead body in the woods, and she pries open a Pandora's box of secrets, including double lives and the hypocrisy that masks sin behind piety. This novel becomes more powerful as one reads, building to a heartstopping denouement, yet remaining strictly observant of the minutiae of daily life that give the book its honesty and pathos.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.77 Inches, Length: 5.05 Inches, Weight: 1.11 Pounds, Width: 1.33 Inches",14.43,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/23/9780140244823.jpg,Success,39.0,20.3

Are the long hours spent at work really necessary to increase organizational productivity? Leslie A. Perlow documents the worklife of employees who assume that for their own success and the success of their organization they must put in extended hours on the job. Perlow doesn't buy it. She challenges the basic assumption that the more employees work, the better the corporation will do.For nine months, Perlow studied the work practices of a product development team of software engineers at a Fortune 500 corporation. She reports her findings in detailed stories about individual employees and in more analytic chapters. Perlow first describes the individual heroics necessary to succeed in the existing work culture. She then explains how the system of rewards perpetuates crises and continuous interruptions,while discouraging cooperation. Finally, she shows how the resulting work practices damage both organizational productivity and the quality of individuals' lives outside of work. Perlow initiated a collaborative effort to restructure the way team members worked. Managers who were involved credit the project for the rare and important on-time launch of the product the engineers were developing. In the end, Finding Time shows that it is possible to create new work practices that enable individuals to have more personal and family time while also improving the corporation's productivity.",en,New Edition,"Height: 9.14 Inches, Length: 5.72 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/52/9780801484452.jpg,Success,104.0,20.3

""Such summer evenings were filled with quiet voices, dogs barking far away, the fire crackling, and often we could hear the faint drums and songs of a ceremony somewhere in the distance,"" writes Luci Tapahonso in this compelling collection. <i>Blue Horses Rush In</i> takes its title from a poem about the birth of her granddaughter Chamisa, whose heart ""pounded quickly and we recognized / the sound of horses running: / the thundering of hooves on the desert floor."" Through such personal insights, this collection follows the cycle of a woman's life and underlines what it means to be Navajo in the late twentieth century. The book marks a major accomplishment in American literature for its successful blending of Navajo cultural values and forms with the English language, while at the same time retaining the Navajo character. Here, Luci Tapahonso walks slowly through an ancient Hohokam village, recalling stories passed down from generation to generation. Later in the book, she may tell a funny story about a friend, then, within a few pages, describe family rituals like roasting green chiles or baking bread in an outside oven. Throughout, Tapahonso shares with readers her belief in the power of pollen and prayer feathers and sacred songs. Many of these stories were originally told in Navajo, taking no longer than ten minutes in the telling. ""Yet, in recreating them, it is necessary to describe the land, the sky, the light, and other details of time and place,"" writes Tapahonso. ""In this way, I attempt to create and convey the setting for the oral text. In writing, I revisit the place or places concerned and try to bring the reader to them, thereby enabling myself and other Navajos to sojourn mentally and emotionally in our home, Dinétah.""</p>",en,,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/82/9780816517282.jpg,Success,103.0,20.3

White women organizing against the racial integration of schools. Native American women struggling for Indian treaty rights. African American women in the Black Panther Party. What prompts these women to adopt political stances outside mainstream politics? How are these women changed by personal experiences of militancy and activism?</p>
<p>Until recently, radical and militant activists have been viewed largely as male, while women have been assumed to be apolitical, more interested in domestic concerns and personal relationships than in public issues and political controversies. Despite evidence that women have been involved in a wide range of political activities, from revolutionary parties to racial hate groups, little attention has been paid to women's radical action.</p>
<p><b>No Middle Ground</b> brings together a wide variety of contributors to uncover women's roles in radical and militant movements. Examining women's radicalism in the United States from the 1950s through the 1990s, the volume details women's activism in both right-wing and left-wing movements, in feminist as well as anti-feminist groups, and in both movements supporting racial equality and those favoring race supremacism. The essays shed light on the conditions which encourage women's militancy, the issues around which women mobilize, how they organize, and what divides them in organizations.</p>
<p>The essays and personal narratives in <b>No Middle Ground</b> advance our understanding of the gendered underpinnings of activism that occurs outside the ""middle ground"" of conventional electoral and pressure group politics. They suggest the significance of identity, consciousness, personal biography, and external context for understanding women's involvement with radical protest movements.</p>

This coming-of-age novel's <i>jolie-laide</i> protagonist, Elizabeth Taube, is a disaffected, disconnected-but-spirited girl trapped in the sameness of suburban Long Island. Her self-involved parents may not love her, but others do, including a furrier who takes to picking her up after elementary school so that he can feed her chocolates and wrap her in ash-blonde mink. Perversity is in the eye of the beholder, however, and for the affection-starved Elizabeth, indulging a fur fetish seems a fair trade-off for the mostly chaste paternal affection she receives in exchange. <P>Bloom doesn't skirt the pain of rejection and loneliness, but embraces it along with the humor and intelligence (and imperfect judgment) that give her characters their aching credibility. Through Elizabeth, Bloom comments wryly on the nature of love, as in this aside about high school sex: ""Kids have nowhere to fuck and nowhere to shower. Only adults, cheating and careful, clean up afterwards."" At one point in her quest for happiness, Elizabeth, a half-Jewish white girl, wanders into an A.M.E. Zion church, where the minister talks her into helping out Mrs. Hill, an elderly, nearly blind member of the congregation. Mrs. Hill lodges her curmudgeonly, self-righteous self into Elizabeth's affections, and when the opportunity arises, grills Elizabeth's middle school teacher (and, by now, lover) about his intentions regarding ""her girl."" <P><i>Love Invents Us</i>, is a misleading title for this immensely satisfying read, for while we learn about Elizabeth through her head-ons and sideswipes of the heart, her actual identity ù and her knowing acceptance of the world as a simultaneously disappointing and love-filled place ù needs no invention. It's clear and strong from the book's first sentence: ""I wasn't surprised to find myself in the back of Mr. Klein's store, wearing only my undershirt and panties, surrounded by sable."" Don't let the near-pedophilia fool you, though, or mask the essence of the love story within ù surprisingly innocent even as it reflects the best and worst of human frailty and desire. -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,Later Printing,"Height: 8.01 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches",11.63,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/29/9780375750229.jpg,Success,120.0,20.3

Editor Lester B. Brown posits six gender styles in traditional American Indian culture&#58; men and women, not-men and not-women (persons of one biological sex assuming the identity of the opposite sex in some form), and gays and lesbians. He brings together chapters that emphasize American Indian spirituality, present new perspectives, and provide readers with a beginning understanding of the place of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Indians within American Indian culture and within American society. This beginning will help you understand these unique people and the special challenges and multiple prejudices they face.<p>Traditionally, American Indian cultures showed great respect and honor for alternative gender styles, since these were believed to be part of the sacred web of life. If the Great Spirit chose to create alternative sexualities or gender roles, who was bold enough to oppose such power? If one&rsquo;s spiritual quest revealed one&rsquo;s identity to be that of not-woman, not-man, gay, or lesbian, who should defy their calling? The interpretation of contemporary American Indian religions that gay American Indians retain sacred rights within Indian cultures, and that they can share this gift with others, have implications for therapy, identity formation, social movements, and general human relations. <p>Social workers and other human service professionals, American Indian studies students, sociologists, anthropologists, and lesbian and gay scholars will find Two Spirit People enlightening and a significant contribution to the development of professional interventions for oppressed groups that is ethnically and culturally sensitive. Only by understanding the belief systems from which these oppressed groups come will you begin to really help them achieve positive change. You will become better equipped to specifically help gay and lesbian American Indians as you gain insight into&#58;<BR><ul><li>American Indian alternative gender styles<BR><li>social service issues for American Indian lesbians and gay men<BR><li>American Indian not-men and not-women and their choosing ceremonies<BR><li>American Indian lesbian and gay identity development<BR><li>American Indian lesbian and gay literature<BR><li>AIDS and American Indians<p>Two Spirit People helps you see that family and community acceptance of lesbians and gays is possible. The families of American Indian lesbians and gays do not usually abandon them, thus helping them face a generally unaccepting American milieu. Looking to this book and the American Indian perspective of alternative sexuality/gender styles, American society as a whole can begin to take a new approach to the treatment and understanding of other groups traditionally held to the &#8220;outside&#8221; of American mainstream society. </ul></p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.9038952742 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",155.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/33/9780789000033.jpg,Success,91.0,20.3

1-85343-364-0,Women and Alcohol: Contemporary and Historical Perspectives,"Plant, Moira",Free Association Books,250.0,1997-01-19,,Paperback,"Alchohol consumption and alcohol-related problems amongwomen have long been a focus of concern and often the targets for prejudice and distortion. This book brings together a wide range of contemporary and historical evidence on the consumption of alcohol and its associated adverse consequences and benefits amongst women. Broad in its perspective, it does not concentrate solely upon the ill effects associated with heavy or inappropriate drinking by women. Neither does it lose sight of the historical, moral and social context in which drinking occurs. The book records the widespread and persisting ambivalence or hostility in many cultures towards the relation of women with alcohol by reference to religious and social pressures, gender roles and stereotypes and the view of alcohol as a facilitator of unrestrained and 'wanton' behaviour. The ambiguity accorded is contrasted with the normative nature of female drinking in many contexts and the dominant role of women as producers and retailers of alcohol in many developing societies. The topics covered include: international trends; sexual behaviour; physical and psychological effects; pregnancy; risk taking; child abuse and other violence; prevention, treatment, and harm minimisation. The book ends with probably the most comprehensive reference resource on the subject ever published. Not all that has been written about alcohol consumption by women has been reasonable or objective. This book emphasises that women are not a high-risk group. However it also demonstrates that there are important differences between men and women in many aspects of consumption and that the freedom of women to drink, and the decency with which alcohol problems are managed, do depend upon the preservation of fundamental human rights. 
<p> ""Her new book, with over 2000 references, is an astonishing tour de force for a single author: a comprehensive social, historical and, indeed global survey of women's drinking."" ""The burning practical issue is how to end the isolation of the woman drinker who needs help. A stunning chapter on treatment issues (largely male oriented) and especially the difficulties experienced by women in counselling, which should be mandatory reading for therapists of both sexes, offers a glimmer of hope.""

We deny that women batter their husbands. We forget that the statistics prove that children in America are abused mostly by women. We ignore the 200 percent increase in crime by women during a period in which most crime statistics are dropping. Instead, we transform female violence into victimhood by citing PMS, battered wife syndrome, postpartum depression as the sources of women's actions. When She Was Bad tells the stories of such women as Karla Homolka, who raped and killed three women, including her own sister, then blamed it on battered wife syndrome; Dorothea Puente, who murdered several elderly tenants in her boardinghouse before attracting any attention; and Marti Salas-Tarin, an ex-con who runs a halfway house for women just out of prison.

Miller, Genaro Padilla",OUP,672.0,1997-04-15,,Paperback,"<p>A major goal of the New Western History is to chronicle the vast diversity of western experience. In this pathbreaking anthology, coeditors Elizabeth Jameson and Susan Armitage-who brought us ""The Women’s West in 1987""-meet that challenge by bringing together twenty-nine essays that present women of all races as actors in their own lives and in the history of the American West and locate them in a framework that connects gender, race, and class.</p>
<p>In mythic sagas of the American West, the wide western range offered boundless opportunity to a limited cast of white men. Buffalo roamed, deer and antelope played, and women’s voices were never heard. Writing the Range allows us to hear many long-silenced women: Spanish-Mexican settlers and American Indians on New Spain’s northern frontiers; Chinese, Basque, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Slavic, and Irish immigrants; film stars Dolores del Rio and Lupe Velez; Navajos and African Americans who moved to western cities during World War II; and the activist Mothers of East Los Angeles, who organized to resist environmental dangers to their community.</p>
<p>A valuable introduction to the rapidly changing field of western history, Writing the Range explains clearly how race, class, and culture are constructed and connected. The first section examines issues raised by more than a decade of multicultural western women’s histories; following are six chronological sections spanning four centures. Each section offers a short introduction connecting is essays and placing them in analytic and historical perspective. Clearly written and accessible, Writing the Range makes a major contribution in ethnic history, women’s history, and interpretations of the American West.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.89 Pounds, Width: 1.68 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/25/9780806129525.jpg,Success,105.0,20.3
