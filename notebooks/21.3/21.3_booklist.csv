In <i>Always From Somewhere Else,</i> Agosin’s homage to her father becomes much more than a simple life story; it is a captivating and moving meditation on the boundaries of national and cultural identities, the meanings of exile and home, and the legacies of storytelling, memory, and love.<br>
""In this beautifully composed tribute to the life of her father, Marjorie Agosín first describes the flight of her grandparents, Abraham and Raquel from the war-ravaged and increasingly anti-Semitic Russia of 1917. They lived as refugees in Istanbul and Marseilles, where Moisés was born, before settling with their three sons in Quillota, Chile. In vivid detail, Agosín contrasts the beauty of the Chilean countryside with the ugliness of the entrenched anti-Semitism that made her father a permanent outsider. . . . Agosín paints a moving portrait of a man who, despite his love for his family, his work, and classical music, was, like herself, marked at the core of his identity as a wandering exile.""—<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>
 ""This is a haunting work of extraordinary grace and depth.""—Claribel Alegria<br>

Frantzen challenges the long accepted view that the early Middle Ages tolerated and even fostered same-sex relations and that intolerance of homosexuality developed only late in the medieval period.

It's big money and a major career move, but Alex just can't seem to forget a first love he's left behind in Texas. When Alex is outed by a national tabloid, chaotic complications ensue as his career in daytime drama and his relationship with an acerbic International Male pretty boy/sitcom starlet are jolted by comic aftershocks. Suddenly, all hell breaks loose and he's being bombarded by betrayed fans, stalked by a self-professed warlock, and attacked by homophobes who want him off the show. Torrid, dishy, outrageously romantic, this hilarious first novel is both a deliciously satiric skewering of the glitziest Hollywood has to offer, and a sweetly wicked boy-meets-boy tale of unrequited love.

At The Heart Of The Book Is Myss's Challenge To Five Myths That Stand In The Way Of Healing&#58; My Life Is Defined By My Wound (perhaps The Most Original Concept Here); Being Healthy Means Being Alone; Feeling Pain Means Being Destroyed; All Illness Is The Result Of Negativity; And True Change Is Impossible. Myss Believes That Giving Up These Myths Leads One Closer To Healing. Many Will Think Her Concepts Too Far Out To Be Of Use; Others Will See Her As Visionary.

But this government-sponsored, church-supported program also attracted some 2,000 women - most of whom were part of Mennonite, Amish, Brethren, or Quaker families with deeply held antiwar beliefsto 151 alternative service locations across the country. Rachel Waltner Goossen tells the story of these women against the good war, women who identified themselves as conscientious objectors. Despite cultural hostility and discriminatory federal policies, they sought to demonstrate their humanitarian convictions by taking part in Civilian Public Service work. Based on little-known archival sources as well as oral history interviews and questionnaire responses, Goossen's study reveals the extent to which these women's religious and philosophical beliefs placed them on the margins of American society. Encouraged by religious traditions that prized nonconformity, these women made unusual choices, questioned government dictums, and defied societal expectations; all of which set them apart from the millions of Americans who supported the war effort.",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches",8.49,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/68/9780807823668.jpg,Success,15.0,21.3

Still, A Consensus Has Prevailed That, Unlike Their Northern Counterparts, Women Of The Antebellum South Were Largely Excluded From Public Life. With This Book, Elizabeth Varon Effectively Challenges Such Historical Assumptions. Using A Wide Array Of Sources, She Demonstrates That Throughout The Antebellum Period, White Southern Women Of The Slaveholding Class Were Important Actors In The Public Drama Of Politics. Through Their Voluntary Associations, Legislative Petitions, Presence At Political Meetings And Rallies, And Published Appeals, Virginia's Elite White Women Lent Their Support To Such Controversial Reform Enterprises As The Temperance Movement And The American Colonization Society, To The Electoral Campaigns Of The Whig And Democratic Parties, To The Literary Defense Of Slavery, And To The Causes Of Unionism And Secession.

<p>Internationally syndicated radio superhost and columnist, controversial psycho-therapist, and author of the break-out <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers <b>How Could You Do That?!</b> and <b>Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives,</b> Dr. Laura Schlessinger is back with <b>Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives.</b></p>
<p>In ten vital, compelling chapters, Dr. Laura speaks her mind on:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Stupid Chivalry</b><br>
 By getting involved with the wrong woman (weak, flaky, damaged, needy, desperate, stupid, untrustworthy, immature, etc.) you think that your love will save/transform her.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Independence</b><br>
 Unwilling to admit ""need"" for bonding and intimacy, you hide in excesses of work, play, drink, drugs, porn, and meaningless sex.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Ambition</b><br>
 Unable to comfortably and proudly accept your inherent importance to society and family as husband and father, you bow to the false idols of money, toys, power, and status.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Strength</b><br>
Uncomfortable with feeling weak, vulnerable, useless, powerless, or rejected, you use intimidation, force, or passive-aggressiveness to regain control.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Sex</b><br>
Taking an attraction, opportunity, or erection as a ""sign,"" you measure your masculinity and power by sexual conquests, infidelities, and orgasms.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Matrimony</b><br>
Lacking a mature sense of the purpose, meaning, or value of marriage, you realize too late you've gone down the aisle with the wrong woman for the wrong reasons and feel helpless to ""fix it.""</li>
<li><b>Stupid Husbanding</b><br>
Thinking that marriage is the honorable discharge from loving courtship, you continue to live as though you were single and your ""mommy-wife"" will take care of everything else.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Parenting</b><br>
Believing that only women/mothers nurture children, you withdraw from hands-on parenting to assert your masculine importance, missing out on the true ""soul food"" of a child's hug.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Boyishness</b><br>
Having not yet worked out a comfortable emotional and social understanding with your mother, you form relationships with women that become geared to avenge, resolve, or protect you from your ties to Mommy.</li>
<li><b>Stupid Machismo</b><br>
Understanding the true and meaningful difference between being male and a man, you can become a man.</li>

It is a comic, biting, surreal investigation of the question of self and identity in the North American middle-class-a trope of insulating banalities which trades the bodyâs physical and spiritual content for the artifice of a formalized security and predictability. Hannah, wife and mother of two teenagers, vacationing with her husband Lyle in New York, wakes up in the middle of the night and looks at the man sleeping in the bed next to her and screams. She does not remember who she is, who Lyle is, how she got there, and finally, how to speak. Revealed to the audience in a series of flashbacks and through Lyleâs search for her, she ends up wandering among strangers and street people like herself, and is picked up by an artist who 'mounts' her in his studio as another of his 'installations.'</p><p>As Sally Clarkâs first full-length play, <i>Lost Souls and Missing Persons</i> is also an astonishingly complex and accomplished theatrical debut.

<p>A hundred years ago, women were lacing themselves into corsets and teaching their daughters to do the same. The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?</p>
<p>In <b>The Body Project</b>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance—in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <b>The Body Project</b> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism—a world in which the body is their primary project.</p>

We are taught to think of Islam as a culture wherein social code and religious law alike force women to accept male authority and surrender to the veil. How could feminism emerge under such a code, let alone flourish? Now, traveling throughout Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as Islamic communities in the United States, acclaimed Arab Studies scholar and bestselling author Elizabeth Fernea sets out to answer that question.
<p>Fernea's dialogue with friends, colleagues, and acquaintances prompts a range of diverse and unpredictable responses, but in every country she visits, women demonstrate they are anything but passive. In Iraq, we see an 85 percent literacy rate among women; in Egypt, we see women owning their own farms; and in Israel, we see women at the very forefront of peacemaking efforts. Poor or rich, educated or illiterate, these women define their own needs, solve their own problems, and determine the boundaries of their own very real, very viable feminism. <i>In Search of Islamic Feminism</i> offers a groundbreaking new interpretation of the status and vision of Muslim women that will open up a new world to its readers, even as it challenges our own sense of what feminism means.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8377565956 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",17.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/87/9780385488587.jpg,Success,122.0,21.3

In this impeccably researched book, Rebecca Blank provides the definitive antidote to the scapegoating, guesswork, and outright misinformation of today's welfare debates. Demonstrating that government aid has been far more effective than most people think, she also explains that even private support for the poor depends extensively on public funds. It takes a nation to fight a problem as pervasive and subtle as modern poverty, and this book argues that we should continue to implement a mix of private and public programs. Federal, state, and local assistance should go hand in hand with private efforts at community development and personal empowerment and change.</p><p>The first part of the book investigates the changing nature of poverty in America. Poverty is harder to combat now than in the past, both because of the changing demographics of who is poor as well as the major deterioration in earnings among less-skilled workers. The second part of the book delves into policies designed to reduce poverty, presenting evidence that many though not all programs have done exactly what they set out to do. The final chapters provide an excellent review of recent policy changes and make workable suggestions for how to improve public assistance programs to assure a safety net, while still encouraging poor adults to find employment and support their families.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.18829159218 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches",29.75,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/13/9780691004013.jpg,Success,114.0,21.3

And she has started hallucinating - for surely it is a hallucination - that her body is being replaced, piece by piece, with someone else's.

A parade of characters - from the grotesque to the jolly to the inexplicable - present her with bizarre gifts, gossip, rumor.

<p><b>Nine Gates</b> begins with a close examination of the roots of poetic craft in ""the mind of concentration"" and concludes by exploring the writer's role in creating a sense of community that is open, inclusive and able to bind the individual and the whole in a way that allows each full self-expression. in between, <b>Nine Gates</b> illumines the nature of originality, translation, the various strategies by which meaning unfolds itself in language, poetry's roots in oral memory and the importance of the shadow to good art.</p>

Delving into the nature of poetry, Jane Hirshfield also writes on the nature of the human mind, perception and experience. <b>Nine Gates</b> is about the underpinnings of poetic craft, but it is also about a way of being alive in the world — alertly, musically, intelligently, passionately, permeably.</p>

It is a reflection of progress that there is such an openly recognizable culture. Yet how to make sense of the choices offered? What do gay men need to read? What books have shaped the gay heart, mind, and soul?
<p><i>The Gay Canon</i> gives its readers answers to these questions. Not only does it list the one hundred great gay books that have influenced writers and continue to shape the gay imagination, it also provides a deeper, more comprehensive look at the twenty-six most seminal works, each of which is followed by a series of useful group discussion questions. Reaching all the way back to Gilgamesh and continuing through classics like <i>Leaves of Grass, Confessions of a Mask,</i> and <i>The Wild Boys,</i> as well as more recent books like <i>Borrowed Time, The Gay Canon</i> consistently avoids impenetrable academic literary criticism in favor of a more popular introduction for general readers and book groups.</p>

1-56858-117-3,Fetish: An Anthology,"Yau, John",Four Walls Eight Windows,232.0,1998,,Paperback,"At some point, we all crave something. That craving -- an unnatural longing -- can be as innocuous as a strong desire for chocolate or a cigarette. Chinese food. Crocodile leather heels. An angora sweater. But at the heart of all intense desires lie impulses heavy with psychosexual implications. This anthology, put together by New York cultural hipster John Yau, explores some of the more extreme variations on this theme. Many of the stories in <i>Fetish</i> are wildly funny -- absurd to those of us with a 'normal' mindset -- and others expose readers to a psychic underbelly, at once menacing and intriguing. Many appear here in print for the first time.
<p>Sex with corpses, John Yau's feet, S&amp;M bars, and magical aerosol sprays are discussed -- in depth -- algongside pederasty, unfulfilled and unfulfillable longings, aching for lost love, and dreaming of a body not one's own.</p>
<p>But the stories in <i>Fetish</i> are not just about sex: you don't have to be a pervert to be a fetishist. A fetish is something we worship, a magical totem. Recent films such as <i>Fetishes</i>, <i>Female Perversions</i>, <i>Kissed</i>, and <i>Crash</i> suggest the wider public's growing interest in fetishism. Eric Kroll's best-selling photography book <i>Fetish</i> is a further example, as is the media's fascination with fetishists from Susie Bright and Robert Mapplethorpe to Imelda Marcos and Howard Hughes.</p>
<p><i>Fetish</i> is outrageous, at turns funny, sad, and provocative. It is a sparkling collection of unfettered work by some of today's most interesting writers.</p>",en,,5.30 (w) x 8.28 (h) x 0.78 (d),15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/70/9781568581170.jpg,Success,67.0,21.3

Having released fourteen of her own critically acclaimed albums as well as recording countless guest appearances on other artists' albums and contributing to film scores, Nanci creates music that has taken root all over the world—her melodies and lyrics resonating wherever they are heard. The Grammy award-winning album Other Voices, Other Rooms—one of the most successful albums of contemporary folk music ever—marked a watershed moment in Nanci Griffith's career. Not only is it her sole album of cover songs, but it is also a seamless blend of tradition, collaboration, and innovation. The follow-up album, Other Voices, Too: A Trip Back to Bountiful, continues that tradition of passing on other writers' work and presenting folk music as a vital force in today's music.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Go behind the scenes with Nanci Griffith and listen in on a very special conversation with Joe Jackson, an acclaimed music journalist, as they explore the roots and inspiration for Nanci's extraordinary career and trace the history of the folk music movement. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
This book is a guide to Nanci's trip back to bountiful—to the place where inspiration springs freely. With more than one hundred behind-the-scenes photographs and candid interviews with Nanci and her collaborators, including John Lomax III, Emmylou Harris, Dave Van Ronk, Pete Seeger, Odetta, the members of the Blue Moon Orchestra, and many, many others, this book offers a rareglimpse into the artistic heart and soul of one of this country's greatest musical treasures: Nanci Griffith.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/73/9780609803073.jpg,Success,134.0,21.3

That debate led to ground-breaking court decisions and major shifts in corporate policies that have had a profound effect on our lives—and on Anita Hill's life. Now, with remarkable insight and total candor, Anita Hill reflects on events before, during, and after the hearings, offering for the first time a complete account that sheds startling new light on this watershed event.</p>
<p>Only after reading her moving recollection of her childhood on her family's Oklahoma farm can we fully appreciate the values that enabled her to withstand the harsh scrutiny she endured during the hearings and for years afterward. Only after reading her detailed narrative of the Senate Judiciary proceedings do we reach a new understanding of how Washington—and the media—rush to judgment. And only after discovering the personal toll of this wrenching ordeal, and how Hill copes, do we gain new respect for this extraordinary woman.</p>
<p>Here is a vitally important work that allows us to understand why Anita Hill did what she did, and thereby brings resolution to one of the most controversial episodes in our nation's history.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.21 Inches, Weight: 0.68784225744 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches",17.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/70/9780385476270.jpg,Success,120.0,21.3

Are there unique health issues for lesbians? Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance abuse? How does homophobia affect lesbian health and the funding of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian health needs fit into the health care system and the larger society? What risk and protective factors shape the physical and mental health of lesbians?</p> <h3>Marilyn R. Gugliucci</h3> <p>This book is a compilation of the research conducted on lesbian health. The editor outlines the challenges of such research for lesbians, researchers, and society. After a presentation of a comprehensive review of the issues, a list of recommendations and interpretations are suggested for mapping out future directions for lesbian health research. The stated purpose is to assess the science base strengths of lesbian health research, review the methodological challenges involved in conducting said research, and to suggest areas for future attention and research. Although women's health is gaining momentum as an area worthy of research, the lesbian subgroup continues to receive minimal attention. Raising the issues pertaining to lesbian health and research in this field is long overdue. The editor's objectives are clearly outlined and achieved. In addition, the contributors demonstrate recognition and knowledge of the psycho-social and societal issues inherent in lesbian cultures which add to the challenges of conducting lesbian health research. The purpose is to help ""...health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and others interested in lesbian health, to face the challenges and opportunities of the new millennium."" A much stronger appeal needs to be made to lesbians. The text is clear, well organized, and accessible. I view it as empowering to lesbians, in that lesbians can assist in moving the health agenda forward through their participation in research and by supporting policy in this area. The contributors appear to be credible. Credentials are listed in their respective fields, however, there is no statement of philosophy regarding their attitudes of lesbianism.Contributors begin with an executive summary of lesbian health research reviews completed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities. The summary is comprehensive and lays the foundation for the in-depth information found in the body of the text that includes the health status of and risks for lesbians. Included is a holistic definition of health which makes it clear that health is more than the absence of disease or infirmity. Lesbian health is viewed in the larger context of society and the healthcare system. Contributors include the societal challenges for lesbians and the effect these may have on their health. The strengths of this book are: the combination of education and sensitivity with which lesbian health issues are discussed; the consistency of the contributors' appeal to the reader to realize the impact these issues have on the research; the inclusion of cultural, racial, ethnic, and societal factors on this research; and the complexities of lesbian health at the personal, professional, and societal levels. Features worth noting are the use of tables, figures, and boxes that enhance the content, and an extensive and current bibliography that is organized by topics. A shortcoming is the repetitive information found in the executive summary that is restated in the body of the text. Lesbianism and its health issues will remain a part of all cultures and populations throughout the world. The proactive stance of this research review and the contributors' recommendations are critical to educating people about lesbians' health issues and relevant policies. It is about time that awareness is raised in this under-funded, under-researched, and largely closeted area of women's health. I commend the editor and contributors for their academic as well as humanistic exposition of this review.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.28 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/36/9780309060936.jpg,Success,6.0,21.3

This transitional period in a woman's life has often been misdiagnosed or ignored. Now Stephanie Bender, an expert in women's hormonal health, sounds a wake-up call for the confusing years before menopause, which require special emotional, dietary, and health guidance.
<p><b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explains how symptoms such as irregular cycles, night sweats and insomnia, decreased libido, memory lapses, and mood swings can be traced to fluctuating hormones. It gives detailed recommendations on how to use both conventional and alternative approaches to lessen symptoms, including the most up-to-date research and new treatments. Bender also goes beyond medical advice to show women how all facets of their lives, from diet to attitude to lifestyle, can be transformed to make this an exciting and productive phase. Perimenopause is a time when women can reconsider their beliefs and priorities with newfound wisdom--perhaps discarding outmoded images of female beauty and examining their relationships with lovers and family on a deeper level. <b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explores this neglected age with practical ways to enhance the quality of all areas of women's lives.</p>

These were busy, onion-scented, Yiddish-accented places. Within their steamy plaster walls, the grandmothers -- remarkable women of insight, strength, and grace -- preserved and handed on history, tradition, community connection, humor, and wry lessons of life. As an adult, Ehrlich followed the path of her assimilating clan, forgetting the kitchen lessons. Her memory was awakened by her mother-in-law, Miriam. A Holocaust survivor who had suffered unspeakable losses, Miriam cooked the flavorsome dishes and carried on the customs of her childhood. Certain that her work mattered, she rebuilt a life of dignity and meaning. Under Miriam's spell, Ehrlich began to reclaim family memories and explore tradition in her own home. Reciting a prayer, grating a potato, lighting a candle, she found a way to build bridges from her grandparents to her children, and to give her children a timeless legacy. <i>Miriam's Kitchen</i> is Elizabeth Ehrlich's preservation of recipes, immigrant stories, childhood memories, droll musings over ritual, and sincere habits of the heart. It is a wise exploration of the need to connect with the past and with tradition, and of our hunger for meaning in a chaotic world.</p> <h3>Newsweek</h3> <p>In this wonderful book, Ehrlich describes a growing commitment, not just to a set of laws but to the women who came before her.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.99 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 0.72532084198 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches",0.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/94/9780140267594.jpg,Success,128.0,21.3

In <i>Walking the Maze</i> she explores Celtic culture both in comparison to Native American ways of life and in its own light and strength, examining the attributes that define and sustain the vitality of the Celtic spirit. Four aspects of traditional Celtic life common to both Celtic and Native American cultures are kinship consciousness, a high regard for women as part of a general commitment to freedom, a fluid perspective of reality, and a primal spiritual engagement with the land. For the Celts this crafted rugged, land-loving individualists, fierce and free in their expression, gracious to all, answerable directly to Spirit but responsible for the entire community. This vision of Celtic spirit informs the vision of how we may live in the present, renewing a cultural integrity that is inseparable from personal wholeness and ecological consciousness. <p>Loren Cruden, a midwife and herbal healer of Scottish descent, worked for many years with a Potawatomie medicine man to develop her personal spiritual practice.

Over half of the works included here have not been published or are only available in the Library of America edition of Hurston's works. As Hurston's fans know, all of her novels draw upon her deep interest in folklore, particularly from her home state of Florida. Here we see the roots of that work, from the wonderful folktale of the monstrous alligator living in a local lake to her recording of folk songs to her work on children's games and the black church. There are also fiery and controversial essays on race and the work of black artists. In a biographical essay, Pamala Bordelon, with the help of Hurston's niece, has re-created the years during which Hurston was working for the FWP and living in Eatonville. She has put together the portrait of a serious writer and folklorist who was running tight on money, but big on spirit.

But behind the crime-scene tape and the doors of the morgue is a world never seen by the public. Now famed pathologist and medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden and award-winning writer Marion Roach take readers into the laboratory, above the autopsy table, onto the witness stand and out in the field to show how advances in forensic science can solve crucial questions in a criminal case, often with startling accuracy.</p>
<p> Baden and Roach reveal how a key clue to the killer of Nicole Brown Simpson was lost when her body was moved to the morgue, and why the JonBenet Ramsey case can never be solved. They show how no clue is too small to be analyzed and no case too old to be reopened. Full of behind-the-scenes drama and surprising revelations, Dead Reckoning is a fascinating look at how forensic science is changing the way we convict the guilty and free the innocent.</p>

Ann Gibson explores Godwin's struggle to break away from the dominant ""masculine"" and existential values of the painters of the time toward an embrace of rich and complex color relationships, surface embellishment, and gracefully-curving forms.

Yet many lesbian and gay writers and readers have been frustrated by recurring gaps and absences in the queer studies approach to sexuality, as well as by the limitations of explicit queer community discourse around sex.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Sex</b> brings the sex back into queer studies, making real bodies, acts, and desires central to analysis of the complex relationships between male and female homosexualities, and their impact on lesbian and gay culture. The contributors to this volume--scholars, artists, activists, and journalists--redress the remarkable dearth of thoughtful discourse about the many ways in which lesbian and gay men are implicated--and viewed within--in each other's sexual realities.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Sex</b> includes writing by lesbians and gay men about each other's bodies, interpretations of different male and female homosexual sex cultures, and reflections on the history, sociology, and politics of changing discourses around queer sexuality. Passionate and challenging, this anthology shows the rich and complex forms through which individuals and communities make meaning from their quotidian sexual impulses, their utopian sexual mores, and their idiosyncratic sexual acts.</p>

Women must look critically at who is in charge of the new technology and challenge the gender codes that can work against them. In this path-breaking book, Melanie Stewart Millar explores power relations in the digital world and asks us to question what is really going on. How is technology shaping our future? What is the role of women within digital culture? What is the corporate agenda? How is it influencing women&amp;apos;s work?</p>
<p>Provocative and incisive, Cracking the Gender Code questions how the gains women have made through feminism over the last decades are being eroded. It looks specifically at how the articles and images of Wired, the magazine of the digital generation, are detrimental to women — a discourse that may be establishing the underlying ideology of a far-reaching communications industry. Stewart Millar argues that simply being computer literate or knowing how to use the Net is not good enough. Women need to demystify the technology and crack the gender code to participate equally in the cyber world of the future.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.70106999316 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/46/9781896764146.jpg,Success,70.0,21.3

More often than not, these stories prove more legend than history. Dating back to the amazons of ancient Asia Minor, myths of fierce, autonomous women of martial excellence abound.</p>
<p>And yet, the only thoroughly documented amazons in world history are the women warriors of Dahomy, an eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western African kingdom. Once dubbed a ""small black Sparta,"" residents of Dahomy shared with the Spartans an intense militarism and sense of collectivism. Moreover, the women of both kingdoms prided themselves on bodies hardened from childhood by rigorous physical exercise. But Spartan women kept in shape to breed male warriors, Dahomean amazons to kill them. Originally a praetorian guard, the Dahomeans developed into a force 6,000 strong and were granted semi-sacred status. They lusted for battle, fighting with fury and valor until the kingdom's final defeat by France in 1892.</p>
<p>Stanley B. Alpern has chronicled this remarkable history in depth for the first time. The product of meticulous archival research, <strong>Amazons of Black Sparta</strong> is defined by Alpern's gift for narrative and will stand as the most comprehensive and accessible account of the woman warriors of Dahomy.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",23.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/87/9780814706787.jpg,Success,18.0,21.3

And Jane finds herself embroiled in a perilous investigation that will soon have her following a trail of clues that leads all the way to Newgate Prison and the House of Lords&#8212;a trail that may well place Jane's own person in the gravest jeopardy.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>With this series opener, Barron catches the Jane Austen popularity wave with impeccable timing-but that may be the best that can be said of this debut. Purportedly editing Austen manuscripts found in an old Maryland estate, Barron recounts the suspicious death of the elderly Frederick Payne, Earl of Scargrave. Anonymous notes accuse Isobel, Austen's friend and Payne's young bride, and a ""grey-hared Lord"" of murdering the earl. Intensifying Isobel's misery is Lord Harold Trowbridge, who badgers the widow to sell him her estate in Barbados. Concerned for her friend and for Fitzroy Payne, the new earl who not-so-secretly loves Isobel, Austen undertakes snooping that leads her to a second corpse and leads Isobel and Fitzroy to trial before the House of Lords. As Austen explores a passel of suspects who are heavy-handedly cast as the originals for the characters in her novels, the reader is offered imitation scholarly footnotes. To be truly helpful, Barron might have better explained how Austen hears Big Ben, a bell cast some 40 years after her death. Austen as mystery writer is an appealing idea, but inadequately served here. Author tour.

Then Ava's future crumbled -- she tested positive for HIV. Believing her life to be over, she returns to Idlewild, Michigan, the small town of her childhood. But home is not what it used to be, and Ava's homecoming is anything but the sorrowful end she expected. Big-city problems have made their way to Idlewild, and Ava finds a new beginning in working with the town's troubled black youths. Oh, and then there's Wild Eddie -- nothing gives a gal a new lease on life like falling in love!</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>It takes talent to make a love story between an AIDS victim and a convicted murderer work, but playwright/essayist Cleage (<i>Deals with the Devil</i>) more than meets the challenge in this gutsy, very likable fiction debut.<P>As a teenager, Ava Johnson couldn't wait to move away from tiny Idlewild, Michigan, a lakefront village originally conceived&#151;and enjoyed for decades&#151;as a resort town for people of color. Now just a half-abandoned dot on the map like any other (except that still, most of its residents are black), Idlewild offers the only safe haven when Ava, now nearly 30, learns she's contracted the HIV virus and is forced to close down her hair salon in Atlanta. Telling herself she's just visiting her older sister, Joyce, for a few weeks before she moves on to San Francisco, sophisticated Ava (whose voice is always feisty and humorous, even when the subject is death) is nevertheless impressed by bighearted Joyce's efforts to help the teenaged girls in her small community. She's also intrigued by handsome, sexily 'together' Eddie Jefferson, a once-wild childhood acquaintance who's returned to Idlewild to raise vegetables, grow dreadlocks, and practice t'ai chi. While giving support to Joyce as she fights her conservative church for the right to teach parenting to adolescents, and assisting (a bit skeptically) when Joyce takes in an addict's abandoned baby, Ava finds herself falling hard for sensitive, nurturing Eddie. Obviously, he's interested, too&#151;but won't he run once he learns she's carrying the virus? Ava hardly dares hope for a final chance at love, even when Eddie reveals his own terrible&#151;and, finally, forgivable&#151;past. Lively, topical, and fantasy-filled. Watch out, Terry McMillan.

Billy's Boy is about John William Seden, the son of dead gay track star Billy Sive. A 12-year-old science geek with his head in the stars, narrator William (he goes by his middle name) uses the phrase potty mouth with sincerity, calls his mom's best friend Auntie and is completely ignorant about sex. He doesn't have an inkling that his mom (a women's track coach whose favorite exclamation is Goddess!) is a lesbian; she, despite her political fervor, remains uncharacteristically closeted to her pubescent son. The novel opens as the Hedens are moving from Sacramento to conservative Orange County, Calif. William quickly becomes friends with Shawn, a neighbor his age, but when their relationship becomes sexual, Shawn's born-again parents put an end to it. The Hedens then flee to Auntie's home near L.A., where William's search for information about his dead father brings him closer to a family he never knew he had, into the life and times of the L.A. riots and into the urban teen pastimes of clubbing and drugs. Warren's experience as an educator of gay teens lends her young characters some needed realism. While clichd situations and clunky dialogue leave much to be desired, Warren's fans will no doubt be eager to continue following the lives of their friends Harlan, Vince, Chino and Betsy through a new, young pair of eyes.

What you're in for is gossip of the most salacious and informed variety, with Plimpton acting as genial segue artist: ""As soon as he landed in a town -- Paris, say -- it didn't seem to take him more than a minute to be at the center of things."" <P>And that is the initial thrill of this book, the center stage vantage it offers on the determined self-formation of an artist. It charts Capote's early childhood in Monroeville, Ala. -- then, in New York, his brief moments as an office boy at the <i>New Yorker</i> (he was fired) and his acceptance at the Yaddo Writers Colony. Then comes the glitter -- <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i>, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> and <i>In Cold Blood</i> -- followed by the climax, Capote's rather over-pondered Black and White Ball, which receives more space here than any one of his books. This is quickly followed by ruin in the guise of alcoholism and his roman &#224; clef <i>Answered Prayers</i>. People are, of course, unkind about him. Norman Mailer weighs in on the ball, saying, ""It certainly was his greatest coup. For some, and I might be one of them, that party was even greater than any particular one of his books."" (Contextually, the statement doesn't seem particularly nasty, especially with the likes of Gore Vidal attempting to be both withering and nonchalant.) <P>The portrait that emerges is of an increasingly vicious, jealous, competitive, deceptive little bastard, the nasty little girl of American letters -- a version of Dorothy Parker. One hundred seventy-four impressive names (a number of them now dead) have been diligently interviewed here, and one can be forgiven for wondering whether anyone with a brain has a kind word for the man. The omissions too are curious -- neither Harper Lee nor C.Z. Guest are included, perhaps explaining the unfortunate inclusion of a 12-page remembrance by one of Capote's boyfriends' daughters. <P>But by the end of this oral biography, there's a more autumnal feeling in the air. Dominick Dunne recalls his own period of drying out, during which he received a letter of admiration, out of the blue, from Capote. ""We were not that good friends that I deserved that kind of letter. So what I had done is obviously what he knew that he should have done. After he died it became very fashionable to kick him. Not me. I've never forgotten that letter he wrote me."" Later comes the charming revelation that Capote made a series of decorative boxes, and <i>Truman Capote</i> ends on a disarmingly gentle note with poet James Dickey's eulogy. Somehow, in the midst of the cacophonous din of this cocktail party, Plimpton has ferreted out the sweetness of the man, using the same method that Dickey described as Capote's: ""the craft of the artist by means of which the intently human thing is caught."" -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.2 Inches, Weight: 1.33 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",18.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/30/9780385491730.jpg,Success,65.0,21.3

Having reached the six-month anniversary of his lover's death, he embarks on a journey of remembrance that will recount his struggle to become a writer and his discovery of what it means to be a gay man. His witty, conversational narrative transports us from the 1960s to the near present, from starkly erotic scenes in the back rooms of New York clubs to episodes of rarefied hilarity in the salons of Paris to moments of family truth in the American Midwest. Along the way, a breathtaking variety of personal connections&#151;and near misses&#151;slowly builds an awareness of the transformative power of genuine friendship, of love and loss, culminating in an indelible experience with a dying man. And as the flow of memory carries us across time, space and society, one man's magnificently realized story grows to encompass an entire generation.<P>Sublimely funny yet elegiac, full of unsparingly trenchant social observation yet infused with wisdom and a deeply felt compassion, <b>The Farewell Symphony</b> is a triumph of reflection and expressive elegance. It is also a stunning and wholly original panorama of gay life over the past thirty years&#151;the crowning achievement of one of our finest writers.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Marked equally by erotic fervor and lyrical intensity, the final installment in White's autobiographical trilogy (following <i>A Boy's Own Story</i> and <i>The Beautiful Room Is Empty</i>) is also the longest, the most baroque and the most elegiac. It carries us from the heady days of the Stonewall Riots through the ravages of AIDS. As usual, White subordinates his interest in the larger matters of recent gay history to the task of vividly evoking the men in the narrator's life through whom those events are understoodusually in a sympathetic, Proustian effort at social taxonomy. The giggling, snobbish, closeted 'White Russians' slumming at the Stonewall typify one kind of gay man, just as Brandy, a sequined and exquisitely theatrical drag queen, represents another. The narrator literally embraces many of them, he seems perpetually as surprised by his catholic tastes in men as he is by the fetishes of others. The novel is invigoratingly, rigorously artificial, flirting with mannerism even as it celebrates sprit and erudition in others (one James Merrill-esque poet dismisses some Japanese scrolls as 'the usual swirls before pine'). Expatriate life, first in Rome and then (for a more extensive period) in an initially inhospitable Paris sharpens the narrator's sense of isolation; a rejection slip for his novel sends him into suicidal despair, from which salvation lies (typically) in a liaison with a Danish tourist. As the narrator's writing career flourishes, he finds himself in the rarefied company of powerful, learned editors, poets and novelists -- company that intersects rather than stands distinct from the priapic habitus of Greenwich Village. Extended episodes involving his mother's decline into illness and dementia, his father's death and his sister's coming to terms with her lesbianism highlight the insularity of the narrator's world. The book is best enjoyed not for a strong story, indeed, the Brice for whom the narrator mourns at the beginning and close is rather peripheral, but for its luminous snapshots of New York, Paris and Rome and of the vital parade of mendowdy, forbiddingly gorgeous, sylph-like, ephebic, closeted, defiantly and militantly outthat crowd its pages.</p>",en,1st Vintage international ed,"Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches",17.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/63/9780679754763.jpg,Success,66.0,21.3
0-8078-4746-1,Sex & Citizenship in Antebellum America (Gender & American Culture),"Isenberg, Nancy",University of North Carolina Press,344.0,1998-12-14,,Paperback,"<p>With this book, Nancy Isenberg illuminates the origins of the women's rights movement. Rather than herald the singular achievements of the 1848 Seneca Falls convention, she examines the confluence of events and ideas—before and after 1848—that, in her view, marked the real birth of feminism. Drawing on a wide range of sources, she demonstrates that women's rights activists of the antebellum era crafted a coherent feminist critique of church, state, and family. In addition, Isenberg shows, they developed a rich theoretical tradition that influenced not only subsequent strains of feminist thought but also ideas about the nature of citizenship and rights more generally.</p>
<p>By focusing on rights discourse and political theory, Isenberg moves beyond a narrow focus on suffrage. Democracy was in the process of being redefined in antebellum America by controversies over such volatile topics as fugitive slave laws, temperance, Sabbath laws, capital punishment, prostitution, the Mexican War, married women's property rights, and labor reform—all of which raised significant legal and constitutional questions. These pressing concerns, debated in women's rights conventions and the popular press, were inseparable from the gendered meaning of nineteenth-century citizenship.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.24781640292 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches",20.1,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/66/9780807847466.jpg,Success,15.0,21.3

<p>Eighty centuries before our time -- in the frozen interior of a place that would someday be called Alaska -- a clubfooted babe was left in the snow to die...until he was rescued by a young woman ravaged by her enemies and sworn to vengeance.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, the child, called Chakliux, has grown to manhood and occupies an honored place as his tribe's treasured storyteller, while his adoptive mother K'os has grown cunning and cold. But in the neighboring village of the Near River People -- where he has been sent to make peace by wedding the shaman's daughter -- a shocking double murder occurs that sets Chakliux on a remarkable journey. Driven by the ancient songs of sea and sky, earth and animals, the storyteller traverses a harsh, unknown, yet enthralling landscape in search of the strange truth about the offenses for which his people have suffered...and about the hateful, ambitious woman who raised him, who may be his most dangerous enemy of all.</p>",en,,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.64 Pounds, Width: 1.216 Inches",7.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/35/9780380726035.jpg,Success,119.0,21.3

She unmasks the effects of sexism on both men and women and describes a spirituality that makes healthier, happier human beings of us all.</p> <p>According to Chittister, the patriarchal culture that has shaped our world has also brought us to the edge of destruction with its dualisms, hierarchies, and inequality. She outlines the historical realities that produced this situation and describes how patriarchal culture and spirituality maintain their hold on us. She then argues that there is another way which is better and introduces us to a feminist worldview that, in recognizing the full humanity of women, leads all of us to new, better ways of being and relating.</p> <p><I>Heart of Flesh&#58; A Feminist Spirituality for Women and Men</I> offers a dynamic vision of spirituality from one of our finest writers of spiritual literature.</p></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>A noted author, lecturer, and Benedictine nun, Chittister considers feminist spirituality to be the true essence and full potential of Christianity. Analyzing the history of patriarchal thinking, she shows how its tendency toward violence, authoritarian domination, and dualistic theology diminishes both women and men. The feminist spirituality she envisions is modeled after the radical example of Jesus, whose human vulnerability and compassion gave him strength to love the sick, the poor, and society's outcasts equally and to resist evil and injustice without violence. Chittister writes with a rare blend of accessible scholarship and impassioned eloquence.

Well, she's back -- and she has a story to tell.</p>
<p><i>Little Sisters</i> explores in depth what it is like to be the youngest, shortest female in a household. These are the women who, as children, had to go to bed first -- when everyone else in the family was up having <i>fun</i>. They learned rebellion early; becoming the ""good girl"" or perhaps a ""wild one,"" whatever the family needed. Many of them endured years of torture from their older siblings whose ""larger and moremature muscles make them eager oppressors."" So says author, journalist, and little sister Carolyn Lieberg, in her playful, informative, and sometimes touching look at the women whose mantra is ""I'll catch up no matter what.""</p>
<p>Interviews with grown-up little sisters yielded stories, insights, and experiences that will ring true with youngest siblings everywhere. Lieberg examines the hotly debated topic of birth order psychology and reveals previously little-known or generally ignored facts about little sisters. They <i>are</i> more popular in school; and studies show that little sisters tend to be radical thinkers and rebellious by nature -- more inclined to create a new system rahter than working to improve it -- something they cheerfully attest to. Drawing from examples in scientific research, personal experience, and literature, <i>Little Sisters</i> eloquently supports (or irreverently disagrees with) a number of theories and truisms. The author finds common characteristics and peculiarities among little sisters but also recognizes their wide-ranging personalities and ambitions.</p>
<p>Little sisters will know why this book is important. For olders siblings, reading this book will help to make up for all that bad behavior many years ago.</p>",en,,"Height: 7 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.46517537282 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/45/9781885171245.jpg,Success,13.0,21.3

The attachment shocks his family and friends. This brilliant young man, betrothed to a twelve-year-old dullard! How can it be? A literary sensation and a bestseller in England and the United States, The Blue Flower was one of eleven books- and the only paperback- chosen as an Editor's Choice by the New York Times Book Review. The 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award Winner in Fiction.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In the introduction to his translation of Novalis's Henry von Ofterdingen, Palmer Hilty described Sophie von Khn as ""a callow, undistinguished girl of Thuringia."" Not a terribly inspiring subject, unless the writer is Fitzgerald, the author of the 1979 Booker Prize winner Offshore and a shortlist perennial for the prize. Fitzgerald presents a brilliant, subtly ironic portrayal of Friedrich von Hardenberg (aka Novalis) as an anti-Pygmalion who takes an unformed, all-too-human girl and fires her into an image of chaste muse. After a strict Saxon upbringing and an education at Jena that revolved around Fichte's idealism, Hardenberg meets the 12-year-old Sophie and falls immediately in love. Sophie is neither particularly pretty nor smart (her diary entries run to ""We began pickling the raspberries"" or ""Today no-one came and nothing happened""), but she is optimistic, innocent, malleable. Their three-year courtship parallels her losing battle with tuberculosis; when she dies at 15, she is petrified as the vulnerable, ethereal and pure muse. There's scads of research here, into daily life in Enlightenment-era Saxony, German reactions to the French Revolution and Napoleon, early 19th-century German philosophy (by page two, a fellow Fichte devotee announces, ""there is no such concept as a thing in itself!""). But history aside, this is a smart novel. Fitzgerald is alternately witty and poignant, especially in her portrayal of the intelligent, capable women who are too often taken for granted by the oblivious poets. Fitzgerald has created an alternately biting and touching exploration of the nature of Romanticismcapital ""R"" and small.

Yet on the outskirts of town an overturned carriage forces the shaken travelers to take refuge at a nearby manor house. And it is there that Jane meets the darkly forbidding yet strangely attractive Mr. Geoffrey Sidmouth. What murky secrets does the brooding Mr. Sidmouth seek to hide? Jane suspects the worst&#8212;but her attention is swiftly diverted when a man is discovered hanged from a makeshift gibbet by the sea. The worthies of Lyme are certain his death is the work of &quot;the Reverend,&quot; the ringleader of the midnight smuggling trade whose identity is the town's paramount mystery. Now, it falls to Jane to entrap and expose the notorious Reverend...even if the evidence points to the last person on earth she wants to suspect...a man who already may have won her heart.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Nearly as wry as Jane Austen herself, Barron delivers pleasure and amusement in her second delicious Jane Austen mystery (Jane and the Unpleasantness of Scargave Manor, 1996). While headed to Lyme Regis for a seaside holiday in 1804, the Austen carriage overturns and Jane's sister Cassandra is injured. The family finds shelter at High Down Grange, home of sardonic Geoffrey Sidmouth and his beautiful cousin Seraphine LeFevre. The narrative is structured as a journal in which Barron's Jane notes her distress at finding herself attracted to the sensuous Sidmouth. The Austens' trip is historically accurate but sparsely enough documented to allow Barron great latitude in creating a tale that makes the most of the period when the Napoleonic Wars raged and the coast was rife with smugglers. At the local Assembly dance, Jane gathers gossip from the Crawfords, Barnewalls, Lucy Armstrong and Captain Percival Fielding, an injured naval officer, who hints that Sidmouth is the Reverend, a notorious smuggler. When Fielding is murdered and Sidmouth arrested, a customs agent asks Jane to conduct an undercover investigation. She eagerly agrees. With indefatigable daring and intelligence, Jane discovers the true natures of her new acquaintances and the meaning of heroism. While Austen denied that her characters were based on real people, Barron cleverly turns to characters from Austen novels as models for her own: Mrs. Bennet for Mrs. Austen, Willoughby for Sidmouth, Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy for Jane's with Sidmouth. Worthy of its origins, this book is a delight.

But that is only a small part of its complicated and complicit performance history.<br>
In this sophisticated and historically grounded analysis, anthropologist Jennifer Robertson draws from over a decade of fieldwork and archival research to explore how the Revue illuminates discourses of sexual politics, nationalism, imperialism, and popular culture in twentieth-century Japan.<br>
The Revue was founded in 1913 as a novel counterpart to the all-male Kabuki theater. Tracing the contradictory meanings of Takarazuka productions over time, with special attention to the World War II period, Robertson illuminates the intricate web of relationships among managers, directors, actors, fans, and social critics, whose clashes and compromises textured the theater and the wider society in colorful and complex ways.<br>
 Using Takarazuka as a key to understanding the ""logic"" of everyday life in Japan and placing the Revue squarely in its own social, historical, and cultural context, she challenges both the stereotypes of ""the Japanese"" and the Eurocentric notions of gender performance and sexuality.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/13/9780520211513.jpg,Success,115.0,21.3

Here, Julie Roy Jeffrey explores the involvement of ordinary women-black and white-in the most significant reform movement prior to the Civil War. She offers a complex and compelling portrait of antebellum women's activism, tracing its changing contours over time.</p><p>For more than three decades, women raised money, carried petitions, created propaganda, sponsored lecture series, circulated newspapers, supported third-party movements, became public lecturers, and assisted fugitive slaves. Indeed, Jeffrey says, theirs was the day-to-day work that helped to keep abolitionism alive. Drawing from letters, diaries, and institutional records, she uses the words of ordinary women to illuminate the meaning of abolitionism in their lives, the rewards and challenges that their commitment provided, and the anguished personal and public steps that abolitionism sometimes demanded they take. Whatever their position on women's rights, argues Jeffrey, their abolitionist activism was a radical step-one that challenged the political and social status quo as well as conventional gender norms.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.0361726314 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches",23.51,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/11/9780807847411.jpg,Success,15.0,21.3

The author Margaret Cesa takes us back to the beginnings of this remarkable woman, born in 1906 in the drab mining town of Castlegate, Utah. Pop's mother, Merea Margherete Luenberger, was from Berne, Switzerland. Her father was Joe Lujan of Taos Pueblo. She was a graduate of the famous 1937 class of the Dorothy Dunn studio at the Santa Fe Indian School. Her paintings, jewelry, textile designs and murals grace museums, private collections and public institutions across the country. During her artistic life, Pop knew some of the most influential people of her times. From the long collaboration of Pop Chalee and Margaret Cesa, we hear, in the artist's own voice, the story and burdens of being a Native American woman artist in a society that was often hostile to one or another of those terms.

Every woman remembers the sting of betrayal of a girlfriend, and every parent of a daughter has seen her come home from school in tears because a girl she thought was her best friend suddenly and inexplicably became her enemy. While boys hash out differences with fists and kicks, girls' societies are marked by secrets and whispers and shifting affection. The lessons learned as an adolescent girl are often carried into adulthood, making women fear confrontation—especially with other women. But the intensity of the struggles reflects the support and healing to be found within these friendships. Girls find themselves in the mirror of other girls, hence the power each has to influence the other. <br>

0-691-02896-6,At the Heart of Freedom,Drucill Cornell,Princeton University Press,240.0,1998-09-14,,Paperback,"<p>How can women create a meaningful and joyous life for themselves? Is it enough to be equal with men? In this provocative and wide-ranging book, Drucilla Cornell argues that women should transcend the quest for equality and focus on what she shows is a far more radical project: achieving freedom. Cornell takes us on a highly original exploration of what it would mean for women politically, legally, and culturally, if we took this ideal of freedom seriously—if, in her words, we recognized that ""hearts starve as well as bodies."" She takes forceful and sometimes surprising stands on such subjects as abortion, prostitution, pornography, same-sex marriage, international human rights, and the rights and obligations of fathers. She also engages with what it means to be free on a theoretical level, drawing on the ideas of such thinkers as Kant, Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Hegel, and Lacan.</p>
<p>Cornell begins by discussing what she believes lies at the heart of freedom: the ability for all individuals to pursue happiness in their own way, especially in matters of love and sex. This is only possible, she argues, if we protect the ""imaginary domain""—a psychic and moral space in which individuals can explore their own sources of happiness. She writes that equality with men does not offer such protection, in part because men themselves are not fully free. Instead, women must focus on ensuring that individuals face minimal interference from the state and from oppressive cultural norms. They must also respect some controversial individual choices. Cornell argues in favor of permitting same-sex couples to marry and adopt children, for example. She presses for access to abortion and for universal day care. She also justifies lifestyles that have not always been supported by other feminists, ranging from staying at home as a primary caregiver to engaging in prostitution. She argues that men should have similar freedoms—thus returning feminism to its promise that freedom for women would mean freedom for all.</p>
<p>Challenging, passionate, and powerfully argued, Cornell's book will have a major impact on the course of feminist thought.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.87523518014 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",38.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/65/9780691028965.jpg,Success,114.0,21.3

In 1976, two strangers were brought together by yet another tragedy. Individually they came to the same conclusion--the paramilitary groups must be shown that the people want peace for themselves and their children. They brought together Catholics and Protestants and formed an organization called the Peace People. In 1977 they were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Only three women had received the honor before them. Clear background information is presented on the history of Ireland. Biographical information is provided in separate chapters on Corrigan and Williams. The growth of the movement they founded and the toll on their personal lives follows. There was controversy surrounding the awarding of the Nobel Prize, and the authors address that in a straightforward manner. Anyone wanting to know more about the history of The Troubles in Northern Ireland will find this interesting. It will also be valuable for school assignments.

As technology documents illness with ever greater precision and clarity, the knowledge and vocabulary of patients is being similarly expanded by activists, consumer advocates, and artists working with new electronic technologies.
<p>Into this breach steps The Visible Woman, collecting professional, academic, and lay viewpoints on gender and the role of visual and textual representation in contemporary health and science. From fetal photography and mammography to mental retardation and chronic fatigue syndrome, The Visible Woman reveals how identities are constructed in medical research and public health initiatives, as well as in popular press accounts of health. New ways of seeing the body, through medical imaging, plastic and sexual surgery, and services for people with disabilities, are all informed, the book argues, by a broader cultural fascination with visuality and media.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the authors' first-hand experiences as medical practitioners, activists, scholars, and patients, The Visible Woman breaks with more established approaches that cast patients as passive objects of medical inquiry, and medical professionals as perpetrators of institutional exploitation in the name of the public good. Asking what it means to be on both ends of the microscope, The Visible Woman highlights the complex perspectives of medical and scientific practitioners who themselves exist both inside and outside their workplaces and professional identities.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 1.03 Inches",30.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/80/9780814715680.jpg,Success,112.0,21.3

0-8203-2078-1,An Un-American Childhood,"Kimmage, Ann",University of Georgia Press,288.0,1998-10-01,,Paperback,"<p><i>An Un-American Childhood</i> is the thoughtful memoir of Ann Kimmage's experiences as a child and young woman in communist Czechoslovakia and China. In 1950, while McCarthyism reigned in America, Kimmage's parents, Abe and Belle Chapman, were active, loyal members of the American Communist Party. Her family lived in Queens, New York, until they were forced underground, illegally fleeing first to Mexico and ultimately Prague, Czechoslovakia, which at the time was in the early stages of its communist revolution. There, the Chapmans became the Capeks—a mystery to their new neighbors, but Czech citizens nonetheless. What Kimmage had at first been led to believe was a brief sojourn became a transforming, thirteen-year journey.</p>
<p>Informative and passionate, <i>An Un-American Childhood</i> provides a unique perspective on the lives of American communist expatriates. Kimmage dramatizes her family's struggle to integrate into a new society and simultaneously maintain their unity and identity. Kimmage and her sister had little choice but to completely adopt Czech language and culture as their own, which created a rift between them and their parents, who were unwilling or unable to do the same.</p>
<p><i>An Un-American Childhood</i> also opens up a personal perspective on the international communist community. Set primarily in Prague, the memoir also recalls a two-year stay in Beijing and visits to such places as East Berlin and Moscow. Kimmage's accounts of her schooling and involvement in social organizations such as the Young Pioneers tell of her exposure to Marxist ideology and morality. However, for her, Kimmage says, life was always less politics than it was culture, language, and relationships.</p>
<p>Ending with their disillusioned return to the United States, the Chapman family's saga presents an intriguing mix of political events and personal reactions. <i>An Un-American Childhood</i> tells of a family twice torn from its cultural roots, and tried, tested, and changed by and for its beliefs.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.999982 Inches, Length: 5.499989 Inches, Weight: 0.9700339528 Pounds, Width: 0.80999838 Inches",10.93,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/86/9780820320786.jpg,Success,116.0,21.3

Are there unique health issues for lesbians? Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance abuse? How does homophobia affect lesbian health and the funding of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian health needs fit into the health care system and the larger society? What risk and protective factors shape the physical and mental health of lesbians?</p> <h3>Marilyn R. Gugliucci</h3> <p>This book is a compilation of the research conducted on lesbian health. The editor outlines the challenges of such research for lesbians, researchers, and society. After a presentation of a comprehensive review of the issues, a list of recommendations and interpretations are suggested for mapping out future directions for lesbian health research. The stated purpose is to assess the science base strengths of lesbian health research, review the methodological challenges involved in conducting said research, and to suggest areas for future attention and research. Although women's health is gaining momentum as an area worthy of research, the lesbian subgroup continues to receive minimal attention. Raising the issues pertaining to lesbian health and research in this field is long overdue. The editor's objectives are clearly outlined and achieved. In addition, the contributors demonstrate recognition and knowledge of the psycho-social and societal issues inherent in lesbian cultures which add to the challenges of conducting lesbian health research. The purpose is to help ""...health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and others interested in lesbian health, to face the challenges and opportunities of the new millennium."" A much stronger appeal needs to be made to lesbians. The text is clear, well organized, and accessible. I view it as empowering to lesbians, in that lesbians can assist in moving the health agenda forward through their participation in research and by supporting policy in this area. The contributors appear to be credible. Credentials are listed in their respective fields, however, there is no statement of philosophy regarding their attitudes of lesbianism.Contributors begin with an executive summary of lesbian health research reviews completed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities. The summary is comprehensive and lays the foundation for the in-depth information found in the body of the text that includes the health status of and risks for lesbians. Included is a holistic definition of health which makes it clear that health is more than the absence of disease or infirmity. Lesbian health is viewed in the larger context of society and the healthcare system. Contributors include the societal challenges for lesbians and the effect these may have on their health. The strengths of this book are: the combination of education and sensitivity with which lesbian health issues are discussed; the consistency of the contributors' appeal to the reader to realize the impact these issues have on the research; the inclusion of cultural, racial, ethnic, and societal factors on this research; and the complexities of lesbian health at the personal, professional, and societal levels. Features worth noting are the use of tables, figures, and boxes that enhance the content, and an extensive and current bibliography that is organized by topics. A shortcoming is the repetitive information found in the executive summary that is restated in the body of the text. Lesbianism and its health issues will remain a part of all cultures and populations throughout the world. The proactive stance of this research review and the contributors' recommendations are critical to educating people about lesbians' health issues and relevant policies. It is about time that awareness is raised in this under-funded, under-researched, and largely closeted area of women's health. I commend the editor and contributors for their academic as well as humanistic exposition of this review.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.14 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",44.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/72/9780309065672.jpg,Success,6.0,21.3

Award-winning author Alicia Steimberg captures the quirky insights of a teenager in a flawlessly rendered colloquial style.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A pungent, semi-autobiographical account of growing up Jewish in Argentina in the 1940s, this small gem of a novel (originally published in Spanish in 1971) is marked by Steimberg's distinctive voice--wittily irreverent, ironic yet warm, at once precocious and worldly-wise. The young narrator (also named Alicia Steimberg) conjures up an offbeat family portrait gallery, including Alicia's controlling, widowed mother, hypochondriac maternal Kiev-born grandmother, atheist vegetarian grandfather and endlessly feuding aunts. Alicia, stigmatized by her anti-Semitic fifth-grade teacher, undergoes a pseudo-conversion to Catholicism with a Catholic playmate 10 years her senior. The narrator's blossoming sexuality (and her mother's dire reprimands against autoeroticism), the trauma of an uncle pawing her sexually, her budding political sensibility in regimented Peronist Argentina are recorded with great humor and the perceptiveness of a sensitive, insecure girl in an eccentric, overbearing family. Labinger's translation is a delight, conveying the sights, sounds, misconceptions and dreams of an intensely experienced youth.

Troubled by the elusiveness of men, yet convinced that they run the world, she can barely conceal her desperation to entice. Struggling with motherhood and the failure of marriage, she takes jobs to bridge intervals between lovers. She sings in a hotel bar, sells dresses, and nurses her father's friend through his last illness, hoping to atone for a self-centered life. The constant in Vivian's life is her son, David. Having seen her worst and best moments, he provides her with consolation and a reason for living, ""In those days of her lover's absence, she grew fascinated with her son's beauty .... with the hard blue of his eyes, with all the particulars of his face, the pliability of his lips."" The Son is the haunting story of a woman who desires ""something more, as if something more had been promised her that was not yet given.""

While at the royal household, Sibiya successfully adjusts to the expectations of her new position: finding her place among the other wives, and negotiating Zulu and Christian tradition. The royal headquarters, however, becomes increasingly plagued by diviseness, dissolution, and ill health. After a series of hardships, climaxing in a beating by Solomon, Sibiya, at the age of twenty-eight, escapes to Durban. Although pursued by Solomon's representative, Sibiya successfully resists Solomon's authority by testifying first in a European magistrate's court and then at the royal headquarters that her marriage was invalid. First published in 1948, <i>Zulu Woman</i> is placed in new context by an introduction and afterword which consider the book's relationship to other African literature and oral history, attend to questions of power and authorship, and draw upon newly available archival materials.</p>",en,0002nd,"Height: 8.7 Inches, Length: 5.7 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",45.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/20/9781558612020.jpg,Success,84.0,21.3

1-55583-458-2,The Gold Diggers (Alyson Classics Library),"Monette, Paul",Alyson Books,384.0,1998-01-01,,Paperback,"Paul Monette, from his arrival on the literary scene in 1979 until his death from AIDS complications in 1995, was one of America's most diverse and prolific writers. <i>The Gold Diggers</i>, originally published by Alyson Publications in 1979, was Monette's first novel-in fact, his first substantial published work of any kind. <i>The Gold Diggers</i> paved the way for seven other novels, most notably <i>Taking Care of Mrs. Carroll</i> and the posthumously published <i>Sanctuary: A Tale of Life in the Woods</i>. Monette also wrote four books of poetry, including <i>Love Alone: Eighteen Elegies for Rog</i>, as well as several screen-to-page novelizations, including Predator and Scarface. 
<p>The body of writing Monette is best known for, however, is his trio of biographical works, <i>Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir</i>, <i>Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story</i>, and <i>Last Watch of the Night: Essays Too Personal and Otherwise</i>. The second of those books, <i>Becoming a Man</i>, won Monette a National Book Award and in turn nearly unprecedented gay-to-straight crossover readership and acclaim. And rightly so. <i>Becoming a Man</i> is the most moving and well-written memoir published in the last decade. It stands alone as the standard by which all other gay-themed nonfiction is judged.</p>
<p><i>The Gold Diggers</i> is clearly among Monette's early works, lacking his later polish and clarity. Perceptive readers will nevertheless recognize flashes of Monette's growing brilliance-his ability to turn a phrase, to conceal and expose characters, to spin plots, to entertain. Ensconced within this early literary brilliance is the story of lovers Peter and Nick, Peter's longtime friend Rita, Nick's hustler/lover Sam, and the pursuit of a priceless cache of stolen artwork hidden in Peter and Nick's mansion, Crook House. The tale is timeless and engaging with a wonderful, happy ending. It is for these reasons that I am pleased to include Paul Monette's <i>The Gold Diggers</i> in the Alyson Classics Library.

This book recounts the stories of these women, whose admission to Harvard was ""halfway heaven,"" a bridge to the American dream after lives of hardship. But they met instead with the darkest of all fates: a tragedy that might have been prevented. Sinedu grew up under communist tyranny in Ethiopia. Trang was born in a Vietnamese forced labor camp, and fled the country with her father and sister to end up on welfare in Boston. Despite their similarities, the two were never friends; Trang was friendly and outgoing, while Sinedu, awkward and shy, had trouble adjusting to a culture vastly different from her own. Drawing upon her astonishing diaries, Thernstrom, a Harvard graduate herself, reconstructs Sinedu's inner life to reveal a girl struggling against isolation and depression. The book reveals Harvard as an institution ill-equipped to deal with mental illness on campus that apparently cared more for its reputation than for its student body.

Largely nameless, OLs serve tea to the men and type and file their reports. They are exempt from the traditional lifetime employment and have few opportunities for promotion. In this engaging ethnography, Yuko Ogasawara exposes the ways that these women resist men's power, and why the men, despite their exclusive command of authority, often subject themselves to the women's control. Ogasawara, a Japanese sociologist trained in the United States, skillfully mines perceptive participant-observation analyses and numerous interviews to outline the tensions and humiliations of OL work. She details the subtle and not-so-subtle ways that OLs who are frustrated by demeaning, dead- jobs thwart their managers and subvert the power structure to their advantage. Using gossip, outright work refusal, and public gift-giving as manipulative strategies, they can ultimately make or break the careers of the men. This intimate and absorbing analysis illustrates how the relationships between women and work, and women and men, are far more complex than the previous literature has shown.

<p>From the world-famous Swiss psychologist whose book <b>The Drama of the Gifted Child</b> has become a classic, here are seven ""life stories"" exploring the countless ways in which our families and our childhood experiences form us and turn us into the people we are today.</p>
<p>How do early experiences of love or suffering affect our adult relationships? What effect is child abuse likely to have on the victim's later life? How does hatred evolve and take root? How do people develop into cult leaders or political tyrants? Through the seven hypothetical scenarios and two essays that make up Paths of Life, Miller examines these questions and many others. Her narratives demonstrate that with knowledge and understanding of our past we have the power to change our future, freeing ourselves from the curse of repeating our parents' mistakes. In this, her eighth book, Alice Miller has given us yet another wise and profound study of the inestimable importance of childhood.</p>
<p>""Alice Miller wrote the book on narcissistic parents and the havoc they wreak on children. Twenty years later, she's still on the case with a new book and even more radical ideas.""--<i>Mirabella</i></p>
