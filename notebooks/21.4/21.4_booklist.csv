Mordden lays bare the emotional landscape of the city within a city that is Gay Manhattan. Blending the comic, the sexy, and the at once idealistic and realistic, these stories represent Ethan Mordden at his very best.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A fourth volume of 11 linked stories from the prolific author of the Buddies trilogy (Everybody Loves You, 1988, etc.), about urban gay men obsessed with friendship, food, the arts, sex, and growing old.<P>For the 20 recurring characters, the advent of AIDS has parsed life into segments&#58; Before, Very Before, and After. Most came of age (and came out) in the early '80s and now comprise a wisecracking, extended family that keeps itself entertained through incessant gab. The ground rules? Don't take yourself too seriously, and use a lacerating quip to deflate anyone who does. The stories, meanwhile, are contrived by incidents that function simply to provide scaffolding on which to hang dish. The rambling discourse is usually vague and pointless, sometimes involving ritualized adolescent parlor games along the lines of If you could sleep with any porn star, who would it be? The literature of repartee can be hilarious (Joe Orton and Ivy Compton-Burnett come to mind), but here the effect is fatally undermined by pages of numbingly unfunny dialogue, relieved by occasional apt one-liners (What's soliciting? Saying yes to someone over 50), while earnest but obvious generalizations about the gay condition often smother the laughs just as they're getting naughty. The more successful tales feature endearing, quirky characters, like the sassy drag queen in What a Difference Miss Faye Made, and Konstantin, the impossibly sweet Russian construction worker in Jeopardy. But the rest of the ensemble is nearly interchangeable.<P> Truly clever conversation can sometimes compensate for otherwise undeveloped characters, but in this case neither the glib pronouncements nor empty personalities give us much reason to care about these chatterboxes.<P></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches",15.45,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/62/9780312193362.jpg,Success,58,21.4

In the aftermath of the early 1990s controversy over the use of silicone breast implants, how do women decide to undergo surgery to enhance or reconstruct their bodies? How does surgery alter a woman's self-image? How do they face the possibility of debilitating autoimmune disease from rupturing or leaking implants? Now, having faced years of medical and personal uncertainty, many have coped by reassessing their lives and their relationships, by sharing information and support with other women with implants, outreach that becomes a means for self-empowerment.

                        <p>This is an interview-based study of women's experiences with breast implants and with the medical profession.

0-8223-1920-9,Hospital Time,"Hoffman, Amy",Duke University Press Books,168,3/4/1997,,Paperback,"<p><P><i>Hospital Time</i> is a memoir about friendship, family, and caregiving in the age of AIDS. Amy Hoffman, a writer, lesbian activist, and former editor of Gay Community News, chronicles with fury and unflinching honesty her experience serving as primary caretaker for her friend and colleague, Mike Riegle, who died from AIDS-related complications in 1992. Hoffman neither idealizes nor deifies Riegle, whom she portrays as a brilliant man, devoted prison rights activist, and very difficult friend. <br>Hoffman became central to Riegle&rsquo;s caregiving when he asked her to be his health-care proxy, and although she willingly chose to do this, she explores her conflicting feelings about herself in this role and about her involvement with Riegle and his grueling struggle with hospitalization, illness, and, finally, death. She tells of the waves of grief that echoed throughout her life, awakening memories of other losses, entering her dreams and fantasies, and altering her relationships with friends, family, and even total strangers. <br>Hoffman&rsquo;s memoir gives voice to the psychological and emotional havoc AIDS creates for those in the difficult role of caring for the terminally ill and it gives recognition to the role that lesbians continue to play in the AIDS emergency. A foreword by Urvashi Vaid, former executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, offers a meditation on the politics of AIDS and the role of family in the lives of lesbians and gay men.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In Hospital Time, Boston-based writer Hoffman offers a sober examination of the caregiving role the gay and lesbian community has taken upon itself in response to the AIDS crisis. A lesbian caring for a dying gay friend, Hoffman describes the all too common situation of the gay or lesbian family replacing the biological family at the sick man's deathbed. Her memoir, which reads much like a novel, is built around the illness and death in 1992 of her difficult, brilliant friend, Mike Riegle. And though Hoffman alludes to her anger at Mike, she is unflagging in her commitment, including acting as his health-care proxy. She both understands and resents his idiosyncrasies about food, privacy, even sex, and she captures all the vacillating emotions that accompany caring for a dying loved one. She ultimately concludes, ""As angry as I got at him, as frustrated and upset, it didn't occur to me to stop, and he knew it wouldn't, and gave me his love and trust."" Hospital Time is an honest portrait of the complex emotions that come with caring for the terminally ill.

It is the variety of the representations of women--as gods, Madonnas, witches, and so on--that we hope to capture, in its permanence as well as its many transformations."" Informed by the work of seventy-five distinguished historians, this five-volume series sets before us an engaging, panoramic chronicle that extends from antiquity to the present day. The inaugural volume brings women from the margins of ancient history into the fore. The authors' deft analysis offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. In the minds of the ancients, the roles for which women were destined were silent ones: motherhood and homemaking, tasks relegated to obscurity by scribes who focused exclusively on the deeds of men. Even the census neglected women; in Rome, only heiresses were counted. But the dearth of information about women in official archives and the near absence of writing by women from this era stand in stark contrast to the astonishing profusion of texts and images created by men that are concerned with women and gender. The number of women's representations is astonishing. The authors draw upon sources ranging from gravestones to floor plans, from stele inscriptions to papyrus rolls, from vase paintings to Greek and Roman literary works, to illustrate how representations of women evolved during this age. They journey into the minds of men--from the Greeks imagining their goddesses to the Church Fathers inventing the figure of the martyred female saint--and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes.

1-57344-040-X,A Fragile Union: New and Selected Writings,"Nestle, Joan",Cleis Press,230,10/19/1998,,Paperback,"<p><i>A Fragile Union</i> is Joan Nestle's collection of intimate essays and narratives about lesbian sexuality, butch-femme relationships, sex writing, the importance of preserving the history of pre-Stonewall gays and lesbians, the love that is possible between lesbians and gay men, and the often shaky camaraderie among lesbians as that community continues to flex its diversity. Readers of <i>A Restricted Country</i> and other Nestle writings are familiar with the author's themes of unity and difference. In <i>A Fragile Union</i>, she delves still deeper. Living with cancer, facing death, Nestle now explores other fragile unions: the fragility of her sexual desire in the face of her illness, the fragility of memory in the face of enormous loss and fear, her belief in the possibility of hope, her love for her people -- women, lesbians and gays, the working class, Jews, and all who struggle against injustice.</p> <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3> <p>Poignant and vigorousnand some sexually explicitnessays on both personal history and the herstory of the lesbian community in America. In her introduction, Nestle (co-editor, Sister and Brother, 1994) describes herself as a fifty-eight-year-old white Jewish fem lesbian woman with cancer living in New York City in the United States of America at the end of the twentieth century. This collection comprises reflections on those particulars, ranging from commentary on her working-class mother's eloquent journals through the history of lesbianism as it began to accumulate in the Lesbian Herstory Archives (now housed in a Brooklyn townhouse), which Nestle founded. Included are chapters on Nestle's plunge into 1960s political activismnmarching and demonstrating against nuclear arms and communist-baiters while keeping her sexual preferences secret from her socialist comrades. Beginning in that decade, however, lesbianism began to come out of the closet and the basement bars (Nestle recalls the latter somewhat fondly). In The Politics of Thinking, however, the author reveals her concern that in the 1990s, not only has religious moral fervor dampened free discussion of sexuality, but so have certain kinds of political correctness within the gay community, where anti-pornography factions had developed strength. Many of the stories that Nestle wrote then were descriptive tales of lesbian love affairs, and she found herself wondering whether those stories had hurt lesbian women, as the anti-pornographers suggested. The author also raises questions about the meaning of gender and about the devaluation of the feminine. In the section titled A Gift of Touch are some detailed reminiscences oferotic encounters with loversnas well as reflections on coming to terms with cancer.<P></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.69886537054 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches",14.2,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/00/9781573440400.jpg,Success,15,21.4

This book underscores the importance of including all of the girls' voices into the curriculum where their voices can be nurtured, cultured, and responded to in potentially productive ways.</p><p>Through an exploration of two major writing contexts, the public and the private, Brett Elizabeth Blake chronicles how the girls learned through their writing not only how to name issues salient to them, such as domesticity and racism, but also how to resist the underlying notions of such important issues. The girls' stories are based on nearly three years of study, and the traditional notion of a process approach to writing is challenged by addressing how such an approach must become a site for significant tension and struggle over issues like ownership and voice. Blake suggests several curricular strategies, such as reader response techniques and a violence-prevention unit, as additional approaches that support girls' voices. This book explores and challenges us to look more closely at how the intersection of gender, race, and class is crucial for understanding not only how and what girls write about, but also why they write so deliberately and poignantly about their lives.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.55 Inches, Length: 5.42 Inches, Weight: 0.63052206932 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/02/9780791434802.jpg,Success,31,21.4

It is the variety of the representations of women--as gods, Madonnas, witches, and so on--that we hope to capture, in its permanence as well as its many transformations."" Informed by the work of seventy-five distinguished historians, this five-volume series sets before us an engaging, panoramic chronicle that extends from antiquity to the present day. The inaugural volume brings women from the margins of ancient history into the fore. The authors' deft analysis offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. In the minds of the ancients, the roles for which women were destined were silent ones: motherhood and homemaking, tasks relegated to obscurity by scribes who focused exclusively on the deeds of men. Even the census neglected women; in Rome, only heiresses were counted. But the dearth of information about women in official archives and the near absence of writing by women from this era stand in stark contrast to the astonishing profusion of texts and images created by men that are concerned with women and gender. The number of women's representations is astonishing. The authors draw upon sources ranging from gravestones to floor plans, from stele inscriptions to papyrus rolls, from vase paintings to Greek and Roman literary works, to illustrate how representations of women evolved during this age. They journey into the minds of men--from the Greeks imagining their goddesses to the Church Fathers inventing the figure of the martyred female saint--and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes. The authors explore select aspects o

To Make This Point, These Essays Focus On The 'woman Question' In The Middle East (most Particularly In Egypt And Iran), Especially At The Turn Of The Century, When Gender Became A Highly Charged Nationalist Issue Tied Up In Complex Ways With The West. The Last Two Decades Have Witnessed An Extraordinary Burst Of Energy And Richness In Middle East Women's Studies, And The Contributors To This Volume Exemplify The Vitality Of This New Thinking. They Take Up Issues Of Concern To Historians And Social Thinkers Working On The Postcolonial World. The Essays Challenge The Assumptions Of Other Major Works On Women And Feminism In The Middle East By Questioning, Among Other Things, The Familiar Dichotomy In Which Women's Domesticity Is Associated With Tradition And Modernity With Their Entry Into The Public Sphere. Indeed, Remaking Women Is A Radical Challenge To Any Easy Equation Of Modernity With Progress, Emancipation, And The Empowerment Of Women. The Contributors Are Lila Abu-lughod, Marilyn Booth, Deniz Kandiyoti, Khaled Fahmy, Mervat Hatem, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Omnia Shakry, And Zohreh T. Sullivan.

This question is at the heart of Katya Gibel Azoulay’s <i>Black, Jewish, and Interracial</i>. Motivated by her own experience as the child of a Jewish mother and Jamaican father, Gibel Azoulay blends historical, theoretical, and personal perspectives to explore the possibilities and meanings that arise when Black and Jewish identities merge. As she asks what it means to be Black, Jewish, and interracial, Gibel Azoulay challenges deeply ingrained assumptions about identity and moves toward a consideration of complementary racial identities.<br>
Beginning with an examination of the concept of identity as it figures in philosophical and political thought, Gibel Azoulay moves on to consider and compare the politics and traditions of the Black and Jewish experience in America. Her inquiry draws together such diverse subjects as <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>, the Leo Frank case, ""passing,"" intermarriage, civil rights, and anti-Semitism. The paradoxical presence of being both Black and Jewish, she argues, leads questions of identity, identity politics, and diversity in a new direction as it challenges distinct notions of whiteness and blackness. Rising above familiar notions of identity crisis and cultural confrontation, she offers new insights into the discourse of race and multiculturalism as she suggests that identity can be a more encompassing concept than is usually thought. Gibel Azoulay adds her own personal history and interviews with eight other Black and Jewish individuals to reveal various ways in which interracial identities are being lived, experienced, and understood in contemporary America.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/19/9780822319719.jpg,Success,33,21.4

Kessler says things that need to be said, and she says them clearly, concisely, and with respect for the people whose lives are most affected by the questions she confronts. A must read for anyone concerned with intersex issues."" --Holly Devor, author of Gender Blending: Confronting the Limits of Duality and FTM: Female-to-Male Transsexuals in Society.
<p>""While the physician's response to an infant with ambiguous genitalia has been to produce categories like the 'successful vagina' and the 'good enough penis,' Kessler takes her cues from intersexuals themselves. This book is a brilliant and long overdue call for the reevaluation of gender variability."" --Judith Halberstam, author of Female Masculinity</p>
<p>""Fascinating in what it tells us not only about situation in which sex assignment is uncertain but about the astonishingly weak empirical foundations on which the medical orthodoxies of binary sex and gender are built. A must for anyone interested in the ways widely accepted social beliefs and scientific explanations generate and reinforce each other."" --Ruth Hubbard, author of The Politics of Women's Biology and Exploding the Gene Myth</p>
<p>From the moment intersexuality--the condition of having physical markers (genitals, gonads, or chromosomes) that are neither clearly female nor male--is suspected and diagnosed, social institutions are mobilized in order to maintain the two seemingly objective sexual categories. Infants' bodies are altered, and the ""ambiguous"" is made ""normal."" As Kessler argues, the way the medical and psychological professions manage intersexuality is guided by our culture's beliefs about gender and genitals rather than by the needs of the child.</p>
<p>Interviews with pediatric surgeons and endocrinologists as well as parents of intersexed children and adults who were treated for this condition in childhood lead Kessler to propose several new approaches for physicians in dealing with parents and children. Beyond the medical sphere, the author also evaluates a political vanguard intent on gaining acceptance by physicians and society at large of an intersexed identity.</p>
<p>Lessons from the Intersexed explores the possibilities and implications of suspending a commitment to two ""natural"" genders. It addresses gender destabilization issues arising from intersexuality and compels a rethinking of the meaning of gender, genitals, and sexuality.</p>

But the once unbreakable bond between identical twins Jacob and Jonathan Rosenbaum has become as tenuous as their futures - their adult estrangement as seemingly irreversible as the convictions that separate them. Now twenty-four, Jacob is a gay activist living in Boston; Jonathan's wholehearted embrace of Orthodox Judaism has taken him to a yeshiva in far-off Jerusalem. In the shadow of his best friend's death, Jacob travels to Israel in the hope of reconnecting with his brother. It is a journey that will bring together two lives that are worlds apart and force Jacob to reexamine his sexual and religious identities, as well as his place in his complex and haunted family history. An unexpected arrival proves the catalyst for an ultimate confrontation between Jacob and Jonathan, as it lays bare the shattering secrets of a legacy that began during the Holocaust.",en,,"Height: 8.78 Inches, Length: 5.92 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.15 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/64/9780525944164.jpg,Success,58,21.4

She Focuses On The Role Of Religious Women In Right-wing Christianity And Asks, For Example, Why So Many Women Are Attracted To What Is Often Seen As An Antiwoman Philosophy. The Result, A Telling Analysis Of The Complexity And Appeal Of The Emotions That Matter To Many Americans, Highlights How These Emotions Now Determine Public Policy In Ways That Are Increasingly Dangerous For Those Outside Familiarity's Circle. With Texts From Such Organizations As The Christian Coalition, The Heritage Foundation, And Concerned Women For America, And Writings By Elizabeth Dole, Newt Gingrich, Pat Robertson, And Rush Limbaugh, Kintz Traces The Usefulness Of This Activism For The Secular Claim That Conservative Political Economy Is, In Fact, Simply An Expression Of The Deepest And Most Admirable Elements Of Human Nature Itself. The Discussion Of Limbaugh Shows How He Draws On The Skepticism Of Contemporary Culture To Create A Sense Of Absolute Truth Within His Own Media Performance - Its Truth Guaranteed By The Market. Kintz Also Describes How Conservative Interpretations Of The Holy Scriptures, The U.s. Constitution, And The Declaration Of Independence Have Been Used To Challenge Such Causes As Feminism, Women's Reproductive Rights, And Gay And Lesbian Rights. In Addition To Critiquing The Intellectual And Political Left For Underestimating The Power Of Right-wing Grassroots Organizing, Corporate Interests, And Postmodern Media Sophistication, Between Jesus And The Market Discusses The Proliferation Of Militia Groups, Christian Entrepreneurship, And The Explosive Growth And Selling Of The Promise Keepers.

[Ahlgren] seeks to 'contextualize the life of Teresa the woman and the meaning of Teresa the saint within the Counter-Reformation agenda by exploring the complex and conflicting notions of female sanctity at work in sixteenth-century Spain.' The compelling arguments of the book make it worth reading. . . . Perhaps Ahlgren's most significant contribution to Teresian scholarship is her meticulous assessment of the prolonged theological debate that took place over [Teresa's] person and writings after her death.--Sixteenth Century Journal</p><p>This [book] is indispensable to understanding the saint's motivations and accomplishments. Beginning with a carefully documented analysis of the religious climate before the Valdes Index of 1559, Ahlgren focuses on the alumbrados and holy women who claimed spiritual authority on the basis of visions and mental prayer. . . . Impeccably researched and distinguished by a thorough grasp of the theological and political issues of sixteenth-century Spain, the volume is a brilliant argument for how and why Teresa of Avila authorized in writing and action her belief that 'the discovery of God's presence in the soul is a spiritual imperative for all people.'--Theological Studies</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.6283174467 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches",79.44,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/25/9780801485725.jpg,Success,85,21.4

In this study, based on research done among second-generation Mexican-American women, Rodriguez examines the role the symbol of Guadalupe has played in the development of these women. She goes beyond the thematic and religious implications of the symbol to delve into its relevance to their daily lives.<br> Rodriguez's study offers an important reinterpretation of one of the New World's most potent symbols. Her conclusions dispute the common perception that Guadalupe is a model of servility and suffering. Rather, she reinterprets the symbol of Guadalupe as a liberating and empowering catalyst for Mexican-American women.<br></p> <h3>National Catholic Reporter</h3> <p>Rodriguez examines the holy image in a scholarly and informative way.

It is the first book to concentrate exclusively on lesbian step families rather than on lesbian mothering in general.<p>In Lesbian Step Families&#58; An Ethnography of Love, you&rsquo;ll explore in detail the different kinds of step relationships that are developed and what factors may lead to the different types of step mothering in lesbian step families.

How do we women find ourselves trapped in the institution's games? How does that affect our ability to make progress on issues of primary importance to us? What does that do to our self-image? Can we even afford to be aware of this? The second essay continues Waring's powerful writing on economics and the concept of work. She updates the international situation described in her bestseller Counting for Nothing. Based on her project experience with the United Nations, she exposes the gap between rhetoric and consequence: you wash your pig: this is work; you wash your child: this is welfare... it has no value. The last essay unmasks the rhetoric of human rights. Waring shows how nation states exploit United Nations conventions, while also explaining the the conventions provide for political action.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.46 inches, Length: 5.47 inches, Weight: 0.63493131456 Pounds, Width: 0.56 inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/69/9780802080769.jpg,Success,35,21.4

Her well-documented work convincingly reveals why black people, and women in particular, have reason to mistrust the medical establishment and government programs, especially those related to family planning. Roberts argues for an expanded concept of liberty that will ""facilitate the processes of choice and self-determination"" as well as protect individuals against government coercion. -- Faye Powell, Portland State University Library, Oregon</p>",en,64864th,"Height: 7.95 inches, Length: 5.15 inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.86 inches",17,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/93/9780679758693.jpg,Success,100,21.4

It is also the story of Anna's parents: her mother, a woman as remote as she is seductive, and her father, a misogynist army officer who, when Anna cries, tells her, ""We are not born to be comforted."" <p>As Anna picks her way through this emotional minefield, she encounters people and animals that possess the revelatory powers of figures in a dream: the snakes her father's adjutant kills as emmissaries of the Devil; a poetry loving general; a haunted girl whose mother dies of tuberculosis; a frozen crow that miraculously comes back to life. <i>God's Snake</i> is a work filled with passion, magic, and terror, conceived by a novelist of visionary authority.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Anna is a Greek Army brat following her father from posting to posting throughout Greece just after the Civil War. These years of painful deprivation, spent observing her parents' cruel and loveless marriage, teach her the importance of love in adult life. Exploring emotion, especially through her extended family of aunts, uncles, and grandparents, she attempts to discover an adult role for her changing body and sense of self. Spanidou brilliantly portrays Anna's haunting experience in this remarkable first novel. Eschewing chronology for zoology, she reveals Anna through the various animals she encounters, allowing the child's innocence to touch on allegories that pass into knowledge. A prose style as spare and beautiful as the Greek countryside it describes makes this work pleasing as well as thought-provoking. -- Paul E.

Since the facts don't do that too often, I decided to make it up. . . . That is the real power and joy of being an artist. We can make it come true. Or look true.""—Faith Ringgold, in a 1992 interview This catalog is the first book-length publication devoted to the exquisite story quilts of contemporary artist Faith Ringgold. Combining painted images, handwritten texts, and quilting techniques, Ringgold weaves together modernist painting; feminist critique; postmodernist strategies of appropriation, parody, and montage; and personal memoir in a remarkable synthesis that takes on European modernism, African American folk art, and the ""black aesthetic"" of the 1960s and 1970s. The catalog accompanies an exhibition of <i>The French Collection</i> and <i>The American Collection</i>, a series of story quilts Ringgold has produced since 1990. Catalog essays include an examination of Ringgold's stylistic development through the 1960s and 1970s, an exploration of the social and political aspects of the story quilts, and a recollection by the artist's daughter, writer Michele Wallace.<br>
Ringgold has adapted the tradition of the American slave quilt to create a world in which African Americans and women dominate, where history is not only questioned but also reinvented. The titles of the quilts in Ringgold's <i>French Collection</i> and <i>American Collection</i> suggest her subject range and daring: <i>Jo Baker's Birthday Party</i>; <i>Dinner at Gertrude Stein's</i>; <i>A Portrait of Aunt Jemima</i>; <i>Tubman, Douglass, and Truth: Wanted Dead or Alive</i> are examples. Faith Ringgold's broad audience of admirers (her books for children have won Caldecott and <i>New York Times</i> book illustration honors) will welcome <i>Dancing at the Louvre</i>.

Numerous studies in recent years have documented and lamented a gender gap in science and engineering. From elementary school through college, women's interest in science steadily declines, and as adults, they are less likely to pursue careers in science-related fields.<p><i>Women's Science</i> offers a dramatic counterpoint not only to these findings but also to the related, narrow assumption that ""real science"" only occurs in research and laboratory investigation. This book describes women engaged with science or engineering at the margins&#58; an innovative high school genetics class; a school-to-work internship for prospective engineers, an environmental action group, and a nonprofit conservation agency. In these places&#8212;where people use or rely on science for public, social, or community purposes&#8212;the authors found a remarkably high proportion of women. Moreover, these women were successful at learning and using technical knowledge, they advanced in roughly equal percentages to men, and they generally enjoyed their work.<p>Yet, even in these more marginal workplaces, women had to pay a price. Working outside traditional laboratories, they enjoy little public prestige and receive significantly less financial compensation. Although most employers claimed to treat men and women equally, women in fact only achieved success when they acted like male professionals. <p><i>Women's Science</i> is an original and provocative contribution that expands our conception of scientific practice as it reconfigures both women's role in science and the meaning of science in contemporary society. <p></p> <h3><br>&#151 Times Literary Supplement - Nancy J.

Seventeen-year-old April Schuldt, unmarried, pregnant, and cheated out of her election as homecoming queen by squeamish school administrators, disrupts a pep rally with a protest that engages the whole school.</p>
<p>Where are spirited girls like these in the popular accounts of teenage girlhood, that supposed wasteland of depression, low self-esteem, and passive victimhood? This book, filled with the voices of teenage girls, corrects the misperceptions that have crept into our picture of female adolescence. Based on the author's yearlong conversation with white junior-high and middle-school girls—from the working poor and the middle class—<i>Raising Their Voices</i> allows us to hear how girls adopt some expectations about gender but strenuously resist others, how they use traditionally feminine means to maintain their independence, and how they recognize and resist pressures to ignore their own needs and wishes.</p>
<p>With a psychologist's sensitivity and an anthropologist's attention to cultural variations, Lyn Brown makes provocative observations about individual differences in the girls' experiences and attitudes, and shows how their voices are shaped and constrained by class—with working-class girls more willing to be openly angry than their middle-class peers, and yet more likely to denigrate themselves and attribute their failures to personal weakness.</p>
<p>A compelling and timely corrective to conventional wisdom, this book attunes our hearing to the true voices of teenage girls: determined, confused, amusing, touching, feisty, and clear.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/10/9780674838710.jpg,Success,85,21.4

M. Jacqui Alexander's ``Redrafting Morality'' examines Trinidad and Togabo's 1986 Sexual Offenses Bill, finding that government has a ``major stake in promoting and defending conjugal masculinity'' and in subordinating women by recognizing them only as ``wives.'' In ``Gender and Islamic Fundamentalism,'' Nayereh Tohidi notes how the position of Iranian women has deteriorated since 1979--despite their active participation in the uprising against the Shah--and concludes that `` the women's question should not be relegated to the days after the revolutionital in text. .'' Russo, in ``We Cannot Live Without Our Lives,'' argues that white feminists should not dismiss racism as ``their'' problem but ``work with women of color as peers . . . which means we must give up sole power and control of feminist organizations, political agendas, and theoretical perspectives.''

After years of debate about whether feminism can or should accommodate these other modes of contemporary thought, <i>Ludic Feminism and After</i> provides a way of making a leap forward.</p>
<p>Teresa Ebert rethinks such notions as ""pleasure,"" ""essentialism,"" ""performance,"" ""labor,"" ""class,"" ""body,"" and ""difference"" through readings of influential texts by feminists such as Gayatri Spivak, Rigoberta Mench, Donna Haraway, Jane Gallop, Judith Butler, Diana Fuss, and Teresa de Lauretis. She not only engages the theories of Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, and Baudrillard, but also moves beyond the academic arena to address the ""backlash"" phenomenon and the writings of ""popular"" critics like Camille Paglia. Ebert argues that the crisis of feminist theory in postmodernity is about the very meaning of politics and the possibility for effective social change.</p>
<p>The future of feminism and feminist theory, believes Ebert, lies in reclaiming radical knowledge(s) that have been obscured by what she calls ""ludic theory"": the branch of postmodernism that sees politics primarily as a linguistic and textual practice, and focuses on subverting cultural representations of difference. She argues instead for the possibilities of a ""resistance postmodernism"" in feminism: theory grounded in the social struggle over the ""material differences"" of labor and access to economic means and resources.</p>
<p>Ebert's provocative and powerful book challenges ludic feminism within the academy, and outlines transformative politics and feminist theory that can address material crises, such as the international trade in young women for prostitution, dowry murders in India, and the genocidal rape in Bosnia. The author seeks to go beyond dominant theories to open a radically new space for an active third wave feminism. <i>Ludic Feminism and After</i> is sure to be influential and controversial.</p>

We are taught to think of Islam as a culture wherein social code and religious law alike force women to accept male authority and surrender to the veil. How could feminism emerge under such a code, let alone flourish? Now, traveling throughout Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as Islamic communities in the United States, acclaimed Arab Studies scholar and bestselling author Elizabeth Fernea sets out to answer that question.
<p>Fernea's dialogue with friends, colleagues, and acquaintances prompts a range of diverse and unpredictable responses, but in every country she visits, women demonstrate they are anything but passive. In Iraq, we see an 85 percent literacy rate among women; in Egypt, we see women owning their own farms; and in Israel, we see women at the very forefront of peacemaking efforts. Poor or rich, educated or illiterate, these women define their own needs, solve their own problems, and determine the boundaries of their own very real, very viable feminism. <i>In Search of Islamic Feminism</i> offers a groundbreaking new interpretation of the status and vision of Muslim women that will open up a new world to its readers, even as it challenges our own sense of what feminism means.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8377565956 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",17,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/87/9780385488587.jpg,Success,93,21.4

Every woman remembers the sting of betrayal of a girlfriend, and every parent of a daughter has seen her come home from school in tears because a girl she thought was her best friend suddenly and inexplicably became her enemy. While boys hash out differences with fists and kicks, girls' societies are marked by secrets and whispers and shifting affection. The lessons learned as an adolescent girl are often carried into adulthood, making women fear confrontation—especially with other women. But the intensity of the struggles reflects the support and healing to be found within these friendships. Girls find themselves in the mirror of other girls, hence the power each has to influence the other. <br>

Sylvia Bashevkin's study excavates, however, a much more complex situation. By identifying the policies and goals held in common by feminists in all three countries and tracing their collision course with the conservative policies of the three administrations, she is able to document setbacks but also some progress, despite the right-of-center leaders. She also challenges the assumption that organized interests in the United States are less vulnerable in hard times than those in parliamentary systems, finding that the elections of Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, and Margaret Thatcher had similar effects on both sides of the Atlantic. Her comparative analysis reveals that the policies of current leaders, while marginally better than their predecessors, will not allow women and women's movements to regain lost ground.<p>Organized thematically, rather than by country, <i>Women on the Defensive</i> describes the difficult relationship between feminists and conservatives during a time of bitter ideological and policy battles when the vibrant social movements of the 1960s and 1970s were seriously threatened.<p></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Bashevkin (political science, U. of Toronto) studies the intersection of conservative governments and the women's movements in three countries (the US, England, and Canada), presenting analyses of governmental and legal practices as well as the words of women activists who talk about feminism in the 1980s and beyond.

This Collection Of Work By Leading Feminist Scholars Engages With The Question Of The Political Status Of Poststructuralism Theory Within Feminism. Against The View That The Use Of Post-structuralism Necessarily Weakens Feminism, 'feminists Theorize The Political' Affirms The Contemporary Debate Over Theory As Politically Rich And Consequential. In Laying The Theoretical Groundwork For The Volume, Butler And Scott Posed A Number Of Questions To Prominent Legal Scholars, Literary Critics, Philosophers, Political Theorists, Historians, And Cultural Theorists. The Essays Do Not Settle The Questions But Generate New And Productive Directions For Them. The Volume As A Whole Valorizes The Unsettling Power And Politics Of Theory.^ The Essays In 'feminists Theorize The Political' Speak To The Questions That Emerge From The Convergence Of Feminism And Poststructuralism: What Happens To Feminist Critique When Traditional Foundations--experience, History, Universal Norms--are Called Into Question? Can Feminist Theory Problematize The Notion Of The Subject Without Losing Its Political Effectivity? Which Version Of The Subject Is To Questioned, And How Does That Questioning Open Up Possibilities For Reformulating Agency, Power, And Sites Of Political Resistance? What Are The Consequences Of A Specifically Feminist Reformulation Of Difference? What Are The Uses And Limits Of A Poststructuralist Critique Of Binary Logic For The Theorization Of Racial And Class Differences, The Position Of The Subaltern? This Anthology Represents A Diverse Array Of Theoretical Work Within Feminist Theory With Strong Political Stakes.^ Although Not All Of The Authors Subscribe To Poststructuralism, (and Few Would Concede Post-structuralism Is A Monolithic Enterprise), Each Offers An Innovative Feminist Analysis That Is In Some Way Motivated In And By The Poststructuralist Challenge. 'feminists Theorize The Political' Addresses A Range Of Feminist Concerns, Including Productive Freedom, Anti-discrimination Law, Rape, And Formulating Power In Terms Of Exclusion, Difference And Hierarchy.--source Unknown.

They are also seeking in increasing numbers alternatives to conventional Western medical care. Traditional Chinese medicine has been found to successfully treat many women's health problems, while keeping risks and costs low and preventing adverse side effects. <i>Well Women</i> is the layperson's introduction and guide to the use of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of the most common gynecological problems occurring from puberty to beyond menopause. It offers numerous case histories of women whose symptoms improved or disappeared after treatment by traditional Chinese medical methods. The book presents a strong body of evidence supporting the use of these treatments as alternatives or accompaniments to conventional surgery and drugs, while providing specific suggestions for preventing illness. Refreshingly upbeat, <i>Well Women</i> encourages the understanding of life changes as healthy events.</p>
<p>Organized to be accessible to the general reader, <i>Well Women</i> is divided into chapters including The Cycle, Eliminating Premenstrual Syndrome, Abnormal Changes, Infections, Pregnancy, Postpartum Disorders, Infertility, Menopause, and Life Extension. Each section provides an overview of common dysfunctions and illnesses and, through numerous examples from the author's own practice as an acupuncturist and herbalist, specific remedies that have proven effective for ordinary women. The author explains how acupuncture, herbal medicines, dietary supplements and exercise have cured illness, mitigated the side effects of cancer treatment, and lessened the predisposition to infection and the effects of aging. Women will feel empowered by this book's practical advice for seeking out health care options they can live with.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.251952 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Weight: 0.3747858454 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/39/9780897895439.jpg,Success,7,21.4

0-674-01471-5,Alchemy of Race and Rights: Diary of a Law Professor,"Williams, Patricia J.",Harvard University Press,272,3/1/1992,,Paperback,"<p>Patricia Williams is a lawyer and a professor of commercial law, the great-great-granddaughter of a slave and a white southern lawyer. <i>The Alchemy of Race and Rights</i> is an eloquent autobiographical essay in which the author reflects on the intersection of race, gender, and class. Using the tools of critical literary and legal theory, she sets out her views of contemporary popular culture and current events, from Howard Beach to homelessness, from Tawana Brawley to the law-school classrom, from civil rights to Oprah Winfrey, from Bernhard Goetz to Marth Beth Whitehead. She also traces the workings of ""ordinary racism""&#151;everyday occurences, casual, unintended, banal perhaps, but mortifying. Taking up the metaphor of alchemy, Williams casts the law as a mythological text in which the powers of commerce and the Constitution, wealth and poverty, sanity and insanity, wage war across complex and overlapping boundaries of discourse. In deliberately transgressing such boundaries, she persues a path toward racial justice that is, ultimately, transformative.<P>Williams gets to the roots of racism not by fingerpointing but by much gentler methods. Her book is full of anecdote and witness, vivid characters known and observed, trenchant analysis of the law's shortcomings. Only by such an inquiry and such patient phenomenology can we understand racism. The book is deeply moving and not so, finally, just because racism is wrong&#151;we all know that. What we don't know is how to unthink the process that allows racism to persist. THis Williams enables us to see. The result is a testament of considerable beauty, a triumph of moral tactfullness, The result, as the title suggests, is magic.</p> <h3>Henry Louis Gates, Jr. - The Nation</h3> <p>One of the most invitingly personal, even vulnerable, books I've read...Williams has a knack for keeping you just a bit off balance...Her readings invigorate familiar controversies&#58; If you thought there was nothing new to be said about Howard Beach or Eleanor Bumpurs, Tawana Brawley or Baby M., read Williams on them. But some of the most magical turns of argument flow from far less public events...The law needs a brain...and, even more, a heart and some courage. Certificates won't help.

Are there unique health issues for lesbians? Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance abuse? How does homophobia affect lesbian health and the funding of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian health needs fit into the health care system and the larger society? What risk and protective factors shape the physical and mental health of lesbians?</p> <h3>Marilyn R. Gugliucci</h3> <p>This book is a compilation of the research conducted on lesbian health. The editor outlines the challenges of such research for lesbians, researchers, and society. After a presentation of a comprehensive review of the issues, a list of recommendations and interpretations are suggested for mapping out future directions for lesbian health research. The stated purpose is to assess the science base strengths of lesbian health research, review the methodological challenges involved in conducting said research, and to suggest areas for future attention and research. Although women's health is gaining momentum as an area worthy of research, the lesbian subgroup continues to receive minimal attention. Raising the issues pertaining to lesbian health and research in this field is long overdue. The editor's objectives are clearly outlined and achieved. In addition, the contributors demonstrate recognition and knowledge of the psycho-social and societal issues inherent in lesbian cultures which add to the challenges of conducting lesbian health research. The purpose is to help ""...health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and others interested in lesbian health, to face the challenges and opportunities of the new millennium."" A much stronger appeal needs to be made to lesbians. The text is clear, well organized, and accessible. I view it as empowering to lesbians, in that lesbians can assist in moving the health agenda forward through their participation in research and by supporting policy in this area. The contributors appear to be credible. Credentials are listed in their respective fields, however, there is no statement of philosophy regarding their attitudes of lesbianism.Contributors begin with an executive summary of lesbian health research reviews completed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities. The summary is comprehensive and lays the foundation for the in-depth information found in the body of the text that includes the health status of and risks for lesbians. Included is a holistic definition of health which makes it clear that health is more than the absence of disease or infirmity. Lesbian health is viewed in the larger context of society and the healthcare system. Contributors include the societal challenges for lesbians and the effect these may have on their health. The strengths of this book are: the combination of education and sensitivity with which lesbian health issues are discussed; the consistency of the contributors' appeal to the reader to realize the impact these issues have on the research; the inclusion of cultural, racial, ethnic, and societal factors on this research; and the complexities of lesbian health at the personal, professional, and societal levels. Features worth noting are the use of tables, figures, and boxes that enhance the content, and an extensive and current bibliography that is organized by topics. A shortcoming is the repetitive information found in the executive summary that is restated in the body of the text. Lesbianism and its health issues will remain a part of all cultures and populations throughout the world. The proactive stance of this research review and the contributors' recommendations are critical to educating people about lesbians' health issues and relevant policies. It is about time that awareness is raised in this under-funded, under-researched, and largely closeted area of women's health. I commend the editor and contributors for their academic as well as humanistic exposition of this review.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.14 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",44.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/72/9780309065672.jpg,Success,86,21.4

Women with low-risk pregnancies are frequently failed by the traditional obstetrical system, either because they cannot afford proper prenatal care—and therefore often give birth to babies who need to be assisted by expensive neonatal intensive care—or because the system fosters an attitude of dependency on doctors, surgery and drugs, rather than a sense of empowerment during the birth process. This enlightening book demonstrates with conviction that childbirth can and should be a process of empowerment, and that midwifery should be the standard of care for women with low-risk pregnancies.</p>
<p><i>Diary of a Midwife</i>, written by a certified nurse-midwife and the founder of the first nurse-midwifery graduate education program in Virginia, is based on the author's 13 years delivering babies in rural Virginia. Through the author's experiences as a midwife, mother of three, and veteran of training as a labor and delivery nurse in a busy hospital's maternity ward, the midwife care alternative is revealed to be the best way for healthy women to be collaborators in their own care. Midwives encourage women to develop their inner power for the birth process by providing teaching, support, and comfort. Adequate prenatal care reduces the number of premature and low-birth weight babies, and costly, traumatic medical interventions such as Cesarean and forceps deliveries, episiotomies and routine anesthesia are often avoided. Author Juliana van Olphen-Fehr movingly shows that midwifery is an art and that it can do much to create mothers who are able to greet their newborns with dignified, loving, and strong arms. _</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1401452 Inches, Weight: 0.81350574678 Pounds, Width: 0.51 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/80/9780897895880.jpg,Success,7,21.4

In the process, Judith Fryer Davidov focuses on the lives and work of a particular network of artists linked by time, interaction, influence, and friendship—one that included Gertrude Käsebier, Imogen Cunningham, Dorothea Lange, and Laura Gilpin.<br>
<i><br>
Women’s Camera Work</i> ranges from American women’s photographic practices during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to a study of landscape photography. Using contemporary cultural studies discourse to critique influential male-centered historiography and the male-dominated art world, Davidov exhibits the work of these women; tells their absorbing stories; and discusses representations of North American Indians, African Americans, Asian Americans, and the migrant poor. Evaluating these photographers’ distinct contributions to constructions of Americanness and otherness, she helps us to discover the power of reading images closely, and to learn to see through these women’s eyes.</p>
<p>In presenting one of the most important strands of American photography, this richly illustrated book will interest students of American visual culture, women’s studies, and general readers alike.</p>

One of the most influential writers of the century, her novels and stories blend the storytelling tradition of the South with a modernist sensibility attuned to the mysteries and ambiguities of experience. Welty explores the complex abundance of southern, and particularly southern women's, lives with an artistry that Salman Rushdie has called impossible to overpraise. Complete Novels gathers all of Welty's longer fiction in one volume for the first time. In The Robber Bridegroom (1942), based on a Grimm fairy tale, legendary figures from Mississippi's past, such as the keel-boat captain Mike Fink and the savage outlaws the Harp Brothers, mingle with Welty's own imaginings in a free-ranging and boisterous fantasy set along the Natchez Trace. The richly textured Delta Wedding (1946), set against a backdrop of rural Mississippi in the 1920s, vividly portrays the intricacies of family relationships in its account of the sprawling Fairchild clan. Edna Earle Ponder's unrestrained and delightfully absurd monologue, superb in its capturing of the rhythms of country speech, shows Welty's humor at its idiomatic best in The Ponder Heart (1954), a flight of invention culminating in a murder trial that becomes an occasion for exuberant comedy. The monumental Losing Battles (1970), composed over fifteen years, brings Welty's imaginative gifts to the largest canvas of her career, rendering a Depression-era family reunion with mythic scope and ebullient comic vigor. The volume concludes with The Optimist's Daughter (1972), a taut and moving story of a woman rediscovering the world of her childhood as she comes to terms with her father's death. Often considered her masterpiece, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1972.",en,1,"Height: 8.13 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 1.43961857086 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23.33,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/43/9781883011543.jpg,Success,97,21.4

0-312-21375-1,Virginia Woolf: The Novels (Analysing Texts),"Marsh, Nicholas",Palgrave Macmillan,224,1998,,Paperback,"<p>At the beginning of this century, Virginia Woolf reacted against literary tradition, sought a new definition of fiction, applied her modern, post-Freudian outlook and radically feminist ideas to the problem of writing novels and, in so doing, redefined our concept of this literary form. The results an be seen in <i>Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse</i> and <i>The Waves</i> —three novels of a flowing, impressionistic texture that are, at the same time, highly structured. Making use of detailed analysis of selected extracts from the novels, the reader is taught to explore the delicate and yet rich writing Woolf achieved and to enquire into the significance of her ironies and symbolic structures. This volume does not sidestep the complexity of her works, but challenges the reader to confront, examine and enjoy it.<br>

However, most studies have focused on suburban youth, ignoring a large segment of the population, the urban adolescent.</p><p><B>Urban Girls</B> tries to reverse this trend. The researchers included in this ambitious project realize there is more to adolescence than the suburban experience. The city has unique effects on the people who live there, and they on it. Drawing on experts from across the country, <B>Urban Girls</B> investigates what it is like to be young in an American city. This book also explores the minority experience in America. It is wonderful to see studies of Black and Latina youth that do not automatically label them as future convicts, drug dealers, or with other negative stereotypes.<BR>--<I>The American Reporter</I> <p>Traditional psychology textbooks have ignored the normative development of urban girls and the unique situations they face on a daily basis. Lumped together with their suburban, mostly white and middle class counterparts, their voices are frequently subsumed within the larger study of adolescent development. <B>Urban Girls</B> is the first book to directly focus on the development of urban poor and working class adolescent girls.</p><p>Including both quantitative and qualitative essays, and including contributions from psychologists, sociologists, and public health scholars, this volume explores the lives of a diverse group of girls from varying ethnic and class backgrounds. Topics covered include the identity development of Caribbean-American girls, the role of truth telling in the psychological development of African-American girls, relationships betweenmothers and daughters of different races and ethnicities, friendships, sexuality, health risks, career development, and other subjects of importance to human development.

Glorious bright pictures by Synthia Saint James show us how to see the beauty, and the accompanying CD of Sweet Honey In The Rock singing the song lets us know how to hear it.Ysaye M. Barnwell&#151;a member of the popular a capella quintet of African American women, Sweet Honey In The Rock&#151;wrote the music as well as the lyrics for the song. This breathtaking hardcover picture book and CD will inspire children and adults alike.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A member of Sweet Honey in the Rock, the a capella quintet of African American women, Barnwell brings musical cadences and bittersweet riffs to her first children's book. A girl grows up seeing the world through her Nana's loving eyes, rather than in a coldly objective reflection: ""There were no mirrors in my Nana's house/ no mirrors in my Nana's house/ I was intrigued by the cracks in the wall/ I tasted with joy the dust that would fall."" The image of herself that the girl would later be offered by the world outside her nurturing home is not reflected back to her, either: ""I never knew that my skin was too black/ I never knew that my nose was too flat."" Saint James's (How Mr. Monkey Saw the World) electric-hued acrylic paintings have a graphic boldness, with hard edges resembling collage art. Especially because a refrain centers on Nana's eyes, it seems unfortunate that the faces in the artwork have no features or expressions: and at the end, when the older woman says, ""Chil' look deep into my eyes,"" the reader can't discern any on Nana's face. Younger readers may wish for more visual expressiveness than the abstracted bodies can muster. Adults, however, will be attuned to the book's poignance, for its theme of feeling fully loved and at home in the world also necessitates the loss of childhood innocence. Ages 5-up.

0-8223-2264-1,"Stagestruck: Theater, AIDS, and the Marketing of Gay America",Sarah Schulman,Duke University Press Books,176,9/24/1998,,Paperback,"<p>In <i>Stagestruck</i> noted novelist and outspoken critic Sarah Schulman offers an account of her growing awareness of the startling similarities between her novel <i>People in Trouble</i> and the smash Broadway hit <i>Rent</i>. Written with a powerful and personal voice, Schulman’s book is part gossipy narrative, part behind-the-scenes glimpse into the New York theater culture, and part polemic on how mainstream artists co-opt the work of “marginal” artists to give an air of diversity and authenticity to their own work. Rising above the details of her own case, Schulman boldly uses her suspicions of copyright infringement as an opportunity to initiate a larger conversation on how AIDS and gay experience are being represented in American art and commerce.<br>
	Closely recounting her discovery of the ways in which <i>Rent</i> took materials from her own novel, Schulman takes us on her riveting and infuriating journey through the power structures of New York theater and media, a journey she pursued to seek legal restitution and make her voice heard. Then, to provide a cultural context for the emergence of <i>Rent—</i>which Schulman experienced first-hand as a weekly theater critic for the <i>New York Press</i> at the time of <i>Rent</i>’s premiere—she reveals in rich detail the off- and off-off-Broadway theater scene of the time. She argues that these often neglected works and performances provide more nuanced and accurate depictions of the lives of gay men, Latinos, blacks, lesbians and people with AIDS than popular works seen in full houses on Broadway stages. Schulman brings her discussion full circle with an incisive look at how gay and lesbian culture has become rapidly commodified, not only by mainstream theater productions such as <i>Rent</i> but also by its reduction into a mere demographic made palatable for niche marketing. Ultimately, Schulman argues, American art and culture has made acceptable a representation of “the homosexual” that undermines, if not completely erases, the actual experiences of people who continue to suffer from discrimination or disease. <i>Stagestruck</i>’s message is sure to incite discussion and raise the level of debate about cultural politics in America today.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.06 Inches, Length: 6.19 Inches, Weight: 0.72091159674 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches",53.38,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/41/9780822322641.jpg,Success,35,21.4

0-674-29874-8,Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law,"MacKinnon, Catharine A.",Harvard University Press,332,1/1/1988,,Paperback,"<p>Catharine A. MacKinnon, noted feminist and legal scholar, explores and develops her original theories and practical proposals on sexual politics and law. These discourses, originally delivered as speeches, have been brilliantly woven into a book that retains all the spontaneity and accessibility of a live presentation. MacKinnon offers a unique retrospective on the law of sexual harassment, which she designed and has worked for a decade to establish, and a prospectus on the law of pornography, which she proposes to change in the next ten years. Authentic in voice, sweeping in scope, startling in clarity, urgent, never compromised and often visionary, these discourses advance a new theory of sex inequality and imagine new possibilities for social change.</p>
<p>Through these engaged works on issues such as rape, abortion, athletics, sexual harassment, and pornography, MacKinnon seeks feminism on its own terms, unconstrained by the limits of prior traditions. She argues that viewing gender as a matter of sameness and difference—as virtually all existing theory and law have done—covers up the reality of gender, which is a system of social hierarchy, an imposed inequality of power. She reveals a political system of male dominance and female subordination that sexualizes power for men and powerlessness for women. She analyzes the failure of organized feminism, particularly legal feminism, to alter this condition, exposing the way male supremacy gives women a survival stake in the system that destroys them.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.06042348022 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",20.56,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/43/9780674298743.jpg,Success,39,21.4

0-9654578-5-0,Masks: With an Introduction by Marge Piercy,"Robson, Ruthann",Leapfrog Press,145,3/1/1999,,Paperback,"<p><b><i>Best Poetry of 1999-Library Journal</i></b></p>
<p>Well known by readers of gay and lesbian fiction for her award-winning short story collections and novels; notorious in the legal profession as the nation's ""foremost authority on lesbians and law"" (<i>Village Voice</i>), a professor at the City University of New York, a young mother raising a son, Ruthann Robson's breadth of experience is unique among American poets. With seamless use of poetic craft and ironic wit, Robson tackles subjects as political as they are bizarre: the young woman chained to a radiator by her mother to keep her safe from harm; the teenager who gets herself knocked up because it's less dangerous to be an unwed mother than a lesbian. Affecting, terrifying, but always bathed in a clear hard light, these poems introduce a stunning intelligence and a bold new voice in American poetry.</p>
<p>""Ardent, passionate, and exquisitely queer…Robson's sense of playfulness is wonderful …The poems in <i>Masks</i> are startling not only for their quirky, often whimsical, humanity, but also for their imaginative use of form… There is history in this book. Witch burnings. Concentration camps. Poverty. Robson covers terrifying, white hot terrain with unflinching honesty and a poet's heart… She takes the magnifying glass of poetic language and investigates detail by detail every aspect of the female condition.""-<i>Lambda Book Report</i></p>
<p>""Another excellent book of poetry from 1999, Masks reveals how time and the moment of vision drive the poet to turn upon experience and make language out of it. These impressive poems swallow any distance between maker and reader as they pass from the glories of relationships to the price of loss. Some of Robson's best work is poems about famous women such as Frida Kahlo, Alice B. Toklas, Diane Arbus and Isadora Duncan. This is a truly marvelous collection that haunts the reader and never diminishes the art of the poem.""-<i>Bloomsbury Review</i></p>

<p>In <i>How Rude!,</i> author Alex J. Packer blends outrageous humor with sound advice as he guides readers through the mysterious world of manners from A (""Applause"") to Z (""Zits"").</p>
<p>He starts by explaining why etiquette is important—because people who know how to handle themselves in social situations come out on top, get what they want, feel good about themselves, and enjoy life to the fullest. Fourteen chapters describe the basics of polite behavior in all kinds of situations at home, in school, and in the world.</p>
<p>Teens learn how to be a host with the most (and a guest with the best), what to do (and not do) when going online or waiting in line, how to deal with rude relatives, how to act at the mall and the concert hall, how to make introductions, who invented manners, and much more. Hundreds of ""Dear Alex"" questions and answers cover everything from dating to breaking up, thank-you notes to table manners, ethnic jokes to social cliques, skateboarding to celebrating. Survey results reveal what teens, parents, and teachers think about manners and why they're important.</p>
<p>Full of practical tips for every occasion, How Rude! is a serious etiquette encyclopedia—and a hilarious read.</p>

But unlike most of the others, Farrell's has a strong critical approach, a point of view and a sharp focus. Farrell doesn't simply run down a list of accomplishments, but examines whether or not the magazine kept its promise of bringing feminism to the masses. After a chronological account of the magazine's history, Farrell concludes with a lively section focused on readers' letters. As Farrell points out, these stand as the strongest proof that readers saw <i>Ms.</i> as something more than the usual magazine, and her analysis of what was published and what was not skillfully dissects that relationship. Sometimes accusatory (I don't believe you, <i>Ms.</i> Magazine. In sisterhood??????) and sometimes laudatory, the letters are consistently engaged. Many readers were concerned with advertising, which was debated from the magazine's inception until its present-day incarnation as a subscription-only publication free of ads. Farrell reports that more than 100 readers sent an ad (for a Lady Bic Shaver) from Ms. itself to the magazine's No Comment section, which features sexist media portrayals. Farrell, a professor of American studies and women's studies, has plenty of interesting information and even opinions often lost in her academic jargon (scholars have paid little attention to the role of popular culture in forming a collective oppositional consciousness). It's too bad that a book examining the dissemination of popular feminism couldn't have a more accessible style.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.11994829096 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/50/9780807847350.jpg,Success,91,21.4

Do Parental Leave Policies Improve The Situation For Women? Gender And Family Issues In The Workplace Offers A Variety Of Perspectives On This Important Question. Some Propose That Extended Leave Improves Women's Wages By Allowing Them To Preserve Their Job Tenure. Other Economists Express Concern That Federal Leave Policies Prevent Firms And Their Workers From Acting On Their Own Particular Needs And Constraints, While Others Argue That Because Such Policies Improve The Well-being Of Children They Are Necessary To Society As A Whole. Olivia Mitchell Finds That Although The Availability Of Unpaid Parental Leave Has Sharply Increased, Only A Tiny Percentage Of Workers Have Access To Paid Leave Or Child Care Assistance. Others Caution That The Current Design Of Family-friendly Policies May Promote Gender Inequality By Reinforcing The Traditional Division Of Labor Within Families.

AricÃ² provides the definitive biography of Oriana Fallaci, a popular and flamboyant Italian journalist, war correspondent, and novelist who, in the public imagination, approaches mythical proportions and who, with every work she produces, creates and re-creates that myth.</p><p>Pushing the boundaries of biography, AricÃ²&nbsp;maps out Fallaciâs personal psychological journey through life, paying particular attention to her ongoing and painstaking attempts to establish her own mythical status. He first examines her formation as a literary journalist, emphasizing the high quality of her writing throughout her career. From there, he concentrates on the way in which Fallaciâs personal image began to emerge in her writings as well as the way in which, through her powerful narratives, she catapulted herself into the public eye as her own main character.</p><p>AricÃ²&nbsp;shows how Fallaci is born and reborn in each work and how with each work she takes on a slightly different shape. She became the heroine of her first novel, and even in her reportage on NASA and her interviews with astronauts, she became the star. She kept the spotlight on herself as a war correspondent in Vietnam. In her articles on Mexicoâs suppression of student protests during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, she starred as a champion of liberty and bitter foe of totalitarianism. Her greatest starring roles, however, came in interviews with such political mammoths as Gandhi, Walesa, and Kissinger. In telling the story of how Fallaci built her own myth, AricÃ²&nbsp;explains the theory of mythmaking in general, showing how it motivated her writing. He explains how her childhood in Florence laid the foundation for her entire career and how at the start of that career, she often blurred the distinction between journalism and fiction. Drawn to acting-especially in her Hollywood stories-she managed to become the leading lady in all she wrote.</p><p>AricÃ²&nbsp;concludes that Fallaciâs literary, journalistic writings intimately fuse with her theatrics, forming a combination that relentlessly propelled her embellished, edited image before the public eye.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/37/9780809321537.jpg,Success,89,21.4

Billy's Boy is about John William Seden, the son of dead gay track star Billy Sive. A 12-year-old science geek with his head in the stars, narrator William (he goes by his middle name) uses the phrase potty mouth with sincerity, calls his mom's best friend Auntie and is completely ignorant about sex. He doesn't have an inkling that his mom (a women's track coach whose favorite exclamation is Goddess!) is a lesbian; she, despite her political fervor, remains uncharacteristically closeted to her pubescent son. The novel opens as the Hedens are moving from Sacramento to conservative Orange County, Calif. William quickly becomes friends with Shawn, a neighbor his age, but when their relationship becomes sexual, Shawn's born-again parents put an end to it. The Hedens then flee to Auntie's home near L.A., where William's search for information about his dead father brings him closer to a family he never knew he had, into the life and times of the L.A. riots and into the urban teen pastimes of clubbing and drugs. Warren's experience as an educator of gay teens lends her young characters some needed realism. While clichd situations and clunky dialogue leave much to be desired, Warren's fans will no doubt be eager to continue following the lives of their friends Harlan, Vince, Chino and Betsy through a new, young pair of eyes.

From the 1893 World's Fair to Body Shop advertisements, di Leonardo focuses on the intimate and shifting relations between popular portrayals of exotic Others and the practice of anthropology.

McGuire, <i>Boston Book Review</i></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The title refers simultaneously to American anthropologists and the domestic subjects they most often study: ethnic minorities and women. As evidenced by new retail chains such as Anthropologie, the public and the media often perceive anthropologists as what the author refers to as 'guardians of the offbeat.' Similarly, women and minorities are often viewed both by anthropologists and the public as 'temporally distant' primitives. In this work, di Leonardo (anthropology and women's studies, Northwestern Univ.) presents an in-depth, fascinating history of the changing political context and public personae of American anthropology. Unlike recent histories such as Curtis Hinsley's 'Savages and Scientists' (Smithsonian Institution, 1981), which focuses on anthropology's changing theoretical paradigms, di Leonardo concerns herself with how anthropologists are perceived by the public and portrayed by the media. Although written in sometimes cryptic academic language, this is an engaging study. -- Jim Woodman, Boston Athenaeum</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.6865363043 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",4.25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/38/9780226472638.jpg,Success,90,21.4

In <b>At Home with Pornography</b>, Jane Juffer exposes the fruitlessness of this debate and suggests that it has prevented us from realizing women's changing relationship to erotica and porn.</p>
<p>Over the course of these same twenty-five years, there has been a proliferation of sexually explicit materials geared toward women, made available in increasingly mainstream venues. In asking ""what is the relationship of women to pornography?"" Juffer maintains that we need to stop obsessing over pornography's transgressive aspects, and start focusing on the place of porn and erotica in women's everyday lives. Where, she asks, do women routinely find it, for how much, and how is it circulated and consumed within the home? How is this circulation and consumption shaped by the different marketing categories that attempt to distinguish erotica from porn, such as women's literary erotica and sexual self-help videos for couples?</p>
<p>At <b>Home with Pornography</b> responds to these questions by viewing women's erotica within the context of governmental regulation that attempts to counterpose a ""dangerous"" pornography with the sanctity of the home. Juffer explorers how women's consumption of erotica and porn for their own pleasure can be empowering, while still acting to reinforce conservative ideals. She shows how, for instance, the Victoria's Secret catalog is able to function as a kind of pornography whose circulation is facilitated both by its reliance on Victorian themes of secrecy and privacy and on its appeals to the selfish pleasures of modern career women. In her pursuit to understand what women like and how they get it, Juffer delves into adult cable channels, erotic literary anthologies, sex therapy guides, cyberporn, masturbation, and sex toys, showing the varying degrees to which these materials have been domesticated for home consumption.</p>

A moving account of life in a biracial family, this book is a powerful meditation on motherhood and racism in America, the story of an education into the realities of African American culture.<br>
Lazarre has spent over twenty-five years living in a Black American family, married to an African American man, birthing and raising two sons. A teacher of African American literature, she has been influenced by an autobiographical tradition that is characterized by a speaking out against racism and a grounding of that expression in one’s own experience—an overlapping of the stories of one’s own life and the world. Like the stories of that tradition, Lazarre’s is a recovery of memories that come together in this book with a new sense of meaning. From a crucial moment in which consciousness is transformed, to recalling and accepting the nature and realities of whiteness, each step describes an aspect of her internal and intellectual journey. Recalling events that opened her eyes to her sons’ and husband’s experience as Black Americans—an operation, turned into a horrific nightmare by a doctor’s unconscious racism or the jarring truths brought home by a visit to an exhibit on slavery at the Richmond Museum of the Confederacy—or her own revealing missteps, Lazarre describes a movement from silence to voice, to a commitment to action, and to an appreciation of the value of a fluid, even ambiguous, identity. It is a coming of age that permits a final retelling of family history and family reunion.<br>
With her skill as a novelist and her experience as a teacher, Jane Lazarre has crafted a narrative as compelling as it is telling. It eloquently describes the author’s delight at being accepted into her husband’s family and attests to the power of motherhood. And as personal as this story is, it is a remarkably incisive account of how perceptions of racial difference lie at the heart of the history and culture of America.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/49/9780822320449.jpg,Success,33,21.4

1-85984-893-1,Crossing Borders,,Verso,252,8/17/1998,,Hardcover,"The second installment of the life of the Nobel Peace prize-winning activist. Rigoberta Menchu is a worldwide symbol of courage in the continuing fight of indigenous peoples for justice. The Guatemalan Indian leader first came to the world's attention with the publication of her autobiography ""I, Rigoberta Menchu"" in 1984. The book chronicled the terrible hardship of her childhood in Guatemala, including the murder of her brother, father and mother at the hands of a ruthless military. But it also captured the dignity of Indian daily life in a cadence that was beautifully simple. ""I, Rigoberta Menchu"" has become an international bestseller with one million copies in print. In ""Crossing Borders,"" Menchu picks up her story where the first volume left off. In 1981 she fled from Guatemala to Mexico City, deeply traumatized by the violence against her family and community. She resolved to dedicate her life to the Indian cause and painstakingly built a solidarity movement with the Indians living as outlaws in Guatemala's mountains. In 1988 she returned to Guatemala as a representative of the opposition in exile. She was immediately arrested and was released only after an international outcry. Danielle Mitterand and Desmond Tutu were amongst the leading names in an international campaign to secure the Nobel Peace Prize for Menchu which she was awarded in 1992. The long haul to build effective representation for indigenous peoples has taken Menchu around the world and its telling is a thread throughout this book. But ""Crossing Borders"" is more than an account of a political campaign. In these pages Menchu also talks with deep affection about her mother and the traditions of her Mayan background. In her introduction to ""I, Rigoberta Menchu"" the ethnologist Elizabeth Burgos Debray writes: 'Her voice is so heart-rendingly beautiful because it speaks to us of every facet of the life of a people and their oppressed culture. Her story is overwhelming because what she has to say is simple and true'. In ""Crossing Borders"" that story continues to enchant and inspire.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.28088574222 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/37/9781859848937.jpg,Success,100,21.4

Unlike the developmental literature in which women are studied only as mothers, or the clinical literature which has little theoretical basis, <b>Being Married, Doing Gender</b> places case study material in the context of the power balance between women and men. Caroline Dryden finds that there are contradictions between stereotypical gender roles and the maintenance of an equal partnership that can cause problems for both women and men. <b>Being Married, Doing Gender</b> will be valuable to students studying psychology or gender and women's studies and to marriage guidance counsellors and psychotherapists.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Echoing messages of tissues of lies and the chains that marriage represents from Anne McManus' poem </wedding pest/>, Dryden advocates feminist research on marriage due to the turmoil in which the institution finds itself, its contradictory meanings, and neglect by academic psychology. The author's constructionist approach owes a debt to Jenny Williams' description of marriage as situated at the crossroads between intergroup and interpersonal relations. Biographical sketches of interviewed married couples serve as the conversational data for an analysis of marital identity, emotional experience, and gender power struggles. She concludes that post- feminism is premature. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknew.com)</p>",en,1,,0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/87/9780415165587.jpg,Success,98,21.4

""I'm bored by talk of money."" ""I'm embarrassed to ask for the salary I (probably) deserve."" ""I'm a widow and I don't know anything about my own money.""
<p>A surprising number of women have a poor relationship with money. They may be afraid of it, refuse to deal with it, give it away unwisely, sacrifice their own needs for others -- or even go in the opposite direction, and spend it wildly. Why is this? According to the authors of this breakthrough book, our families, society, and even financial advisors send women negative messages about money. Some of these messages are blatant: ""It's unladylike to get involved with finances."" Others are unconscious messages, such as the daughter who observes her mother wearing old clothes, while her brother gets new shoes every time he asks.</p>
<p>Filled with interactive exercises, self-quizzes, and a ""genogram"" to fill out, the book is do-it-yourself therapy that helps women:</p>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Trace how family attitudes have negatively influenced their feelings about money, self-esteem, and value</li>
<li>Understand money as a form of energy that actually has an important spiritual dimension</li>

</ul>

<p>The 1996 Miss Universe telecast was seen by an estimated 600 million people in 60 countries around the world. Beauty Queens: A Playful History traces the evolution of the beauty pageant from its early days as a slightly scandalous display of feminine self-confidence to a much-mocked sexist spectacle to its recent return to tremendous international popularity.</p>
<p>How did this quirky custom manage to become such a major cultural institution? When and where did the idea originate? (P.T. Barnum seems at least partly responsible.) And why have so many many women eagerly participated as both spectators and contestants? Emphasizing the glory years between 1920 and 1970, Candace Savage offers entertaining yet thought-provoking answers to these questions while having great fun exploring every aspect of the pageant's curious history. Anyone who has ever sniffled as the winner wept tears of joy will thoroughly enjoy this lighthearted tribute.</p>

<p>occasional--if nonetheless indelible--impression on my teenage definition of womanhood. By the time my family got its first TV, circa 1964, the Miss America Pageant had been beaming its message into millions of homes for a decade, and the Miss Canada competition was already into its second year on CTV. Although I would have been well into my teens at the time, my first TV pageant has not left a detailed trace in my mind. All that remains is a hazy sense of a screen filled to bursting with romance heroines. Girls with unromantic addresses in Prince George, British Columbia, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, floated in front of the cameras amid billows of chiffon. To the cynic in me, they looked like a fleet of animated lampshades or vivified meringues.</p>
<p>It was all very silly, and I knew it even then. The romance stories I fed myself on were trashy and cheap, with cardboard characters, stock plots and treacly endings. Smart aleck that I was, I mocked them as ""and-he-kissed-her"" books because of the inevitable, climacteric moment when the good-girl heroine got her man. But this elevated analysis did nothing to temper my compulsive desire for happy endings, and my loud-mouthed scorn of beauty contests did not prevent me from watching the telecasts to their glitzy and glorious conclusions. Yes, the girls looked ridiculous as they swanned their beehived heads; yes, the interview questions and answers made me squirm with embarrassment. The bathing-suit judging was tacky, and the ""talent"" performances made Ed Sullivan's weekly lineup look like a night at the Met. But the crowning of the winner--so ""natural, young and sweet""--sent an electric thrill of pleasure through my pubescent body.</p>
<p>Dream the impossible dream: let it be me, let it be me . . .</p>
<p>Beauty contests on TV were a magic mirror that, willy-nilly, made every girl and woman into a participant, whether she was built like a willow or like a fortress; and recalcitrant tomboys like me were not exempt. In our dizzy identification with winners and losers alike, a whole generation of women and girls in the fifties and sixties tumbled in a narcissistic dream of our own potential perfection. I know, because I was one of them. Against my better judgment and with my whole heart, I was an armchair beauty contestant. And then, one day in 1968, the world began to improve--not only for brains and battleships but for beauties, too.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 9.3 Inches, Weight: 1.27 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/29/9780789204929.jpg,Success,83,21.4
0-8165-1633-2,Feminist Readings of Native American Literature: Coming to Voice,"Donovan, Kathleen M.",University of Arizona Press,181,2/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p>Who in a society can speak, and under what circumstances? These questions are at the heart of both Native American literature and feminist literary and cultural theory. Despite the recent explosion of publication in each of these fields, almost nothing has been written to date that explores the links between the two. With <i>Feminist Readings of Native American Literature</i>, Kathleen Donovan takes an important first step in examining how studies in these two fields inform and influence one another. Focusing on the works of N. Scott Momaday, Joy Harjo, Paula Gunn Allen, and others, Donovan analyzes the texts of these well-known writers, weaving a supporting web of feminist criticism throughout. With careful and gracefully offered insights, the book explores the reciprocally illuminating nature of culture and gender issues. The author demonstrates how Canadian women of mixed-blood ancestry achieve a voice through autobiographies and autobiographical novels. Using a framework of feminist reader response theory, she considers an underlying misogyny in the writings of N. Scott Momaday. And in examining commonalities between specific cultures, she discusses how two women of color, Paula Gunn Allen and Toni Morrison, explore representations of femaleness in their respective cultures. By synthesizing a broad spectrum of critical writing that overlaps women's voices and Native American literature, Donovan expands on the frame of dialogue within feminist literary and cultural theory. Drawing on the related fields of ethnography, ethnopoetics, ecofeminism, and post-colonialism, <i>Feminist Readings of Native American Literature</i> offers the first systematic study of the intersection between two dynamic arenas in literary studies today.</p>",en,3rd ed.,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7054792384 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",2.97,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/39/9780816516339.jpg,Success,89,21.4

By the Spring of 1993, <i>Millennium</i> had come to Broadway and won its highest honor, the Tony Award for Best Play, and the distinguished Pulitzer Prize for drama as well. Through its epic theatrical panorama of the intimate and political dynamics that arise when individuals, histories, and cultures intersect, <i>Millennium</i> captured the imagination and the conscience of all who saw it. Its ability to deeply move the audience in personal, communal, and political ways was admirably (and astoundingly) matched by the subsequent production of the play's second part, <i>Perestroika</i>, which brought Kushner yet another <i>Evening Standard</i> award and Tony Award for Best Play (1994). Tony Kushner has, almost overnight, become the premier American male playwright to ""represent"" the 1990s, as David Mamet and August Wilson dominated critical attention in the 1980s.<br>
The phenomenally positive response to <i>Angels in America</i> was matched by the equally enthusiastic reception of its young, politically engaged playwright, who impressed journalists and scholars with his eloquent intellect, wit, and moral convictions. Kushner spoke for a younger generation of American artists and activists whose art is intimately connected to social vision and ""revolutionary"" possibilities in the public and private sectors. His role as a generational (read ""national,"" ""liberal,"" ""socialist,"" ""Jewish,"" ""queer"") spokesman has provided him with a public platform from which to address concerns that lie at the center of national debate. In a short time Kushner has captured and retained a nation's fascination, and his opinions are widely sought out on a wide range of topics. And, most often, the platform from which Kushner expresses his ideas is the personal interview, in which he boldly confronts Americans to rethink, even to reinvent, themselves as the Millennium approaches.<br>
<i>Tony Kushner in Conversation</i> is the first book to compile Kushner's most significant interviews of the past decade, tracing his career from its early years to his maturing artistic and political visions.

Cassatt's art explores a New Woman's perspective on the spaces of modernity: at the theatre, in the drawing-room and garden, in the studio. Admired by Degas-- who invited her to show with the Impressionists in 1877-- Cassatt's work reveals her profound study of Old Masters and keen responses to contemporary French and Spanish painters. Griselda Pollock puts a new emphasis on Cassatt's interest in Manet and her influence on American collections of French modernism. She also argues that Cassatt's experimentation with etching and pastel from the late 1880s enabled her to represent women and children without sentimentality but with a deepening awareness of a complex psychological charge. 184 illus., 55 in color.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/70/9780500203170.jpg,Success,48,21.4

Crafted by an impressive range of scholars, the essays are empirically rich and theoretically cogent. But most important, they engage the complexities of multicultural, feminist, and multinational ethnographies and the stories that matter to politics, scholarship, and lives. With an ear for the tones of race and gender, this book answers the political, generic, and theoretical challenge of Writing Culture with layered essays that rewrite an important range of cultural conversations.""-Donna Haraway, author of Professor, History of Consciousness Board, UCSC 
<p>""Since the advent of the 'post-modern' in ethnography, we have been much in need of a marvelous volume such as this, placing 'woman' at the center of the debate.

<p>""A groundbreaking book-provocative, illuminating, imaginative-and it is a pleasure to read. A trenchant yet always generous feminist critique of the masculinist bias in the theoretical canon of anthropological texts, it expansively and imaginatively maps the future directions of a feminist anthropology. In moving and courageous acts of reconstruction, the writers in this volume boldly cross disciplinary and generic lines, reading fiction as anthropology, writing theater as ethnography, getting personal, radically reconceiving the relationship of self and other and, thereby, the field itself. Feminist scholars of all disciplines will find hereenabling textual and conceptual strategies as well as memorable voices and powerful stories.""-Marianne Hirsch, Dartmouth College, author of The Mother-Daughter Plot</p>

Hers was the acceptable face of adultery. Discretion was her hallmark. It was her art to be the king's mistress and yet to laud the Royal Family and the institution of marriage. Formidable and manipulative, her attentions to the king brought her wealth, power, and status. Her daughter Violet Trefusis had a long tempestuous affair with the author and aristocrat Vita Sackville-West, during which Vita left her husband and two sons to travel abroad with Violet. It was a liaison that threatened the fabric of Violet's social world, and her passion and recalcitrance in pursuit of it pitted her against her mother and society.
