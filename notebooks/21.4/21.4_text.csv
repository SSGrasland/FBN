Canadian Anti-Racist Feminist Thought
Edited by Enakshi Dua and Angela Robertson
Scratching the Surface brings together 14 anti-racist feminists who examine
ways in which race and gender interact to shape the lives of women of colour
in Canada. This collection of articles covers a broad range of topics such as
the impact of colonialism and its associated discourses on First Nations and
other groups of colonised women; the ways in which the institution of the
nuclear family shapes racism; sexism in communities of colour; and the
Enakshi ka E Angela R response of the Canadian women’s movement to creating an anti-racist
praxis. The book not only provides exciting new insights into how women of
colour experience Canadian society, but also provides instructors with a
textbook that integrates anti-racist and feminist approaches.

JUST YESTERDAY
by Linda Hill
Anyone who believes she wouldn't make the same mistake twice has never
met Grace Sullivan...
With her ten-year relationship slowly self-destructing, the last person
Elizabeth Grey wants to see is Grace Sullivan — the ex-lover whose betrayal
cut Elizabeth the deepest. The one break in her heart that never quite healed.
To make matters worse, Grace is no longer the lanky student that Elizabeth fell
in love with, but a stunningly beautiful news anchor whose confident demeanor
only adds to her devastating attractiveness.
Unwilling to be hurt again, Liz reminds herself that she’s seen it all before,
believed it all before. Yet here she was again. Losing herself in the depths of
Grace's eyes. Feeling her fears vanish in the heat of Grace’s arms. Reliving all
of the passion and promises that seemed so real . . . just yesterday.
