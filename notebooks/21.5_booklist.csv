Several were held publicly at the Schomburg Center in Harlem, and many range far from the ostensible topic of race. Among the more substantive points here: ex-senator Bill Bradley calls for properly funding the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; law professor Patricia Williams suggests that not talking about race leads to stress and mental illness in blacks; Maya Angelou urges listeners to ""use it all,"" to gain inspiration from any thinker. However, the speechifying West tends to applaud rather than challenge his interviewees, and this book does not fully engage many important issuesAfrocentrism, affirmative action, unwed motherhood, tensions between black men and black womenthat will likely affect the future of black America. This title is the first project of the Obsidian Society, a nonprofit organization that helps African American arts projects.

Most of these queens were, by today's standards, astonishingly young. Some were schooled to rule, others not. But all were ambitious, passionate, and determined to hold power. And all, in their successes and failures, ideals and compromises, assumptions and privileges, present interesting contrasts with the lives of modern women. <i>Ten Queens</i> was celebrated as a Booklist Editors' Choice, a Notable Children's Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies, an International Reading Association's Teachers' Choice, and a Bank Street College Best Book, among many other citations.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 11.26 Inches, Length: 9.46 Inches, Weight: 1.99959271634 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches",24.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/38/9780525456438.jpg,Success,32.0,21.5

The reality is more sobering. In <i>Divided Sisters</i>, Midge Wilson and Kathy Russell, the acclaimed authors of <i>The Color Complex</i>, tackle the nature of relationships between black and white women, and explore how they do, and don't, get along.<br>
<br>
Based on scores of interviews, cultural literature and extensive research, <i>Divided Sisters</i> examines relations between black and white women as children, as adults, at school and in college, at work and at home. Truthfully as adults relatively few women feel they are close friends with a woman from another racial background. The book exposes many of the challenges and obstacles that complicate interracial relationships in a society with a long history of racial inequality. What Midge and Kathy discover is that the concerns and frustrations of black and white women are often different, and that these differences are frequently not communicated. For example, women thrown together for the first time in college are often ill-prepared to handle cultural differences in dress, customs, attitudes and background. In addition, peer pressure, economic and historical inequality, real or perceived racism, and fear, play a role in dividing rather than uniting women.<br>
<br>
<i>Divided Sisters</i> is a landmark book that will open readers' eyes to the realities and challenges of bridging what is too frequently a cultural divide.""",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/13/9780385473613.jpg,Success,56.0,21.5

With sure authenticity, the author evokes the atmosphere of 1854, seven years before the Civil War, and brings to life the vivid cast of characters involved. A local election is pending, from which Glynis and Elizabeth Cady Stanton hope will come gains for women's rights. A wealthy resident has started Seneca Falls's first theater, and its production of Macbeth looms large in the story. Glynis herself faces a wrenching decision: Constable Cullen Stuart wants her as his wife when he moves west to become a Pinkerton man. Warm as her regard for Cullen may be, Glynis is reluctant, knowing how her life must change after marriage. Meanwhile, Seneca Falls has become an important stop on the Underground Railroad. Fugitive slaves following the North Star to Canada find support from many of the town's inhabitants, including Glynis. It is a difficult commitment at best, and when complicated by murder, a perilous one as well. Once again, Miriam Grace Monfredo has combined historical events, a moving personal story, and an engrossing mystery in a work of extraordinary interest.

                        <p>The year is 1854. In Seneca Falls, New York, everyone is busy with the opening of a new theater, no one notices the death of a freed slave. As a supporter of the Underground Railroad, Glynis hears information that raises her suspicions, and soon discovers more than she wants to know about some of the so-called sympathizers.

<br>
The question Mary Frances Berry asks: Whose story most strongly influences the making of legal decisions in the American justice system? Using previously unexamined material from state appellate civil and criminal court cases—cases of rape, seduction, and paternity disputes, and cases dealing with murder, inheritance, and property disputes in which sexual relations are at the heart of the story—Berry takes us through two centuries of American case law to show how attitudes toward gender, race, class, and sexuality have materially affected, and continue to affect, judicial decision-making.<br>
<br>
Among the many cases Berry discusses:<br>
<br>
Alabama, 1867—A white woman sues her husband for divorce in both the lower and state supreme courts because of his sexual relationship with a former slave, and is denied her petition on the basis that a sexual relationship between a white man and a black woman is ""of no consequence.""<br>
<br>
New York, 1932—In a surprising victory, the longtime mistress of a theater owner successfully contests her lover's will and proves her right to inherit a wife's portion of the estate.<br>
<br>
Texas, 1984—A suit by a woman against her female lover ends in a decision that allows the court to avoid acknowledging the existence of a lesbian relationship.<br>
<br>
And, in the 1990s, we see thecases of William Kennedy Smith, Mike Tyson, and O. J. Simpson in a new context.<br>
<br>
Moving stories, shocking stories, ironic stories, tragic stories—a book that fascinates in terms of its human drama, by its demonstration of the ways in which prejudice affects justice, and by its account of how the law has evolved (or hasn't) as our racial, social, and sexual attitudes have changed.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/19/9780679436119.jpg,Success,123.0,21.5

Yet on the outskirts of town an overturned carriage forces the shaken travelers to take refuge at a nearby manor house. And it is there that Jane meets the darkly forbidding yet strangely attractive Mr. Geoffrey Sidmouth. What murky secrets does the brooding Mr. Sidmouth seek to hide? Jane suspects the worst&#8212;but her attention is swiftly diverted when a man is discovered hanged from a makeshift gibbet by the sea. The worthies of Lyme are certain his death is the work of &quot;the Reverend,&quot; the ringleader of the midnight smuggling trade whose identity is the town's paramount mystery. Now, it falls to Jane to entrap and expose the notorious Reverend...even if the evidence points to the last person on earth she wants to suspect...a man who already may have won her heart.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Nearly as wry as Jane Austen herself, Barron delivers pleasure and amusement in her second delicious Jane Austen mystery (Jane and the Unpleasantness of Scargave Manor, 1996). While headed to Lyme Regis for a seaside holiday in 1804, the Austen carriage overturns and Jane's sister Cassandra is injured. The family finds shelter at High Down Grange, home of sardonic Geoffrey Sidmouth and his beautiful cousin Seraphine LeFevre. The narrative is structured as a journal in which Barron's Jane notes her distress at finding herself attracted to the sensuous Sidmouth. The Austens' trip is historically accurate but sparsely enough documented to allow Barron great latitude in creating a tale that makes the most of the period when the Napoleonic Wars raged and the coast was rife with smugglers. At the local Assembly dance, Jane gathers gossip from the Crawfords, Barnewalls, Lucy Armstrong and Captain Percival Fielding, an injured naval officer, who hints that Sidmouth is the Reverend, a notorious smuggler. When Fielding is murdered and Sidmouth arrested, a customs agent asks Jane to conduct an undercover investigation. She eagerly agrees. With indefatigable daring and intelligence, Jane discovers the true natures of her new acquaintances and the meaning of heroism. While Austen denied that her characters were based on real people, Barron cleverly turns to characters from Austen novels as models for her own: Mrs. Bennet for Mrs. Austen, Willoughby for Sidmouth, Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy for Jane's with Sidmouth. Worthy of its origins, this book is a delight.

Yet, despite all the obstacles, some are achieving at the highest academic and professional levels.<br> <b>Beating the Odds</b> tells their remarkable stories and shows us what African American families have done to raise academically successful sons, sons who are among the top two percent of African American males in terms of SAT scores and grades. The result of extensive and innovative research, <b>Beating the Odds</b> goes beyond mere analysis&#151;and beyond the relentlessly negative media images&#151;to show us precisely how young Black men can succeed despite the roadblocks of racism, the temptations of crime and drugs, and a popular culture that values being ""cool"" over being educated. By interviewing parents and children from a range of economic and educational backgrounds and from both single and two-parent homes, the authors identify those constants that contribute to academic achievement and offer step-by-step guidance on six essential strategies for effective parenting&#58; child-focused love; strong limit-setting and discipline; continually high expectations; open, consistent, and strong communication; positive racial identity and positive male identity; and full use of community resources. The proof of the effectiveness of such strategies is in the sons themselves, who speak eloquently in these pages about their struggles and successes in both the classroom and the often hostile world that surrounds it.<br> Essential reading for parents, teachers, and school administrators, <b>Beating the Odds</b> offers insight, guidance, and hope for anyone concerned about the plight of young African American men and the society they live in.</p>",en,1,"Height: 6.36 Inches, Length: 9.58 Inches, Weight: 1.20372395052 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches",35.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/92/9780195102192.jpg,Success,53.0,21.5

In this provocative work, the subversive madwoman so privileged by feminist theorists and critics emerges from her confinement into the world of real social power. How, Marta Caminero-Santangelo asks, can such a figure be subversive if she's effectively imprisoned, silent and unseen? Taking issue with a prominent strand of current feminist literary criticism, Caminero-Santangelo identifies a counter narrative in writing by women in the last half-century, one that rejects madness, even as a symbolic resolution.
<p>Caminero-Santangelo considers such writers as Toni Morrison, Eudora Welty, Sylvia Plath, Cristina Garcia, Kate Millett, Helena Maria Viramontes, and Shirley Jackson, locating their narratives of female madness within the context of popularized Freudianism, sociology of ""the"" African-American family, images in the mass media, and other elements of culture to which their writings respond. Their works, Caminero-Santangelo maintains, appropriate images linking madness to feminine aberrance, but do so to expose the regulatory functions that such images serve. These writings reveal how the silent protest emblematized by the madwoman, and celebrated in feminist critical practice, simply serves to lock women into stereotypes long used to oppress them.</p>
<p>The Madwoman Can't Speak offers an alternative explanation for the compelling nature of the figure of the madwoman, allowing a critical move away from the dangerous, ultimately disempowering notions of the subversive potential of madness.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6724098991 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/45/9780801485145.jpg,Success,103.0,21.5

Their ex-wives and children often end up on welfare at taxpayers' expense. Nationally, $50 billion is owed in back support.</p><p>This book is valuable to single parents who need help in getting the child support they are entitled to. It offers help on how to obtain support, so that your family won't end up victims of a deadbeat dad, or in some cases, a deadbeat mom. The book is also meant for grandparents, who often must help support their daughter's children.</p><p><i>Make The Jerk Pay</i> goes beyond just explaining how to use the child support enforcement system. It tells how you can track down a missing spouse by using your own skills and available public records and the Internet. Beyond that, you will learn how to do some sleuthing to uncover money, property and other assets of the deadbeat.</p><p>Men may take offense at the book's title. But we consider it justified because nine out of ten deadbeats are men. For the custodial fathers trying to collect from deadbeat moms, this book is for you too.</p><p>Many men don't want the responsibility of being a father, so they end up divorcing their children as well as their wives. They run off, often moving from state to state. Some create new identities for themselves by changing their names and getting new Social Security numbers, new credit cards and driver's licenses.</p><p>They go to great lengths to conceal their assets from the families they abandon, sometimes putting property in the names of others. Many arrange to be paid under the table so their earnings cannot be traced or attached. Often they will flout court orders to pay child support-knowing they're likely to get away with it. The tactics of deadbeat dads add up to a nightmare, financially and emotionally, for the mothers and children. Too often the mothers are left to fend for themselves at a time when they are least able to cope.</p><p>Many women will not even seek child support. They may fear hostility from their ex-husbands, or feel that asking for child support is like asking for a handout. Others shy away because they fear it will be costly, time-consuming and too much of a hassle to deal with the bureaucratic child support system. If you are such a victim, you may feel abandoned and cheated. That's natural. Some women strike back by denying visitation rights to the father. That's a mistake. It hurts the child and gives the absent father an excuse for not paying child support.</p><p>But you need not feel that you are powerless. There are laws and state and county agencies which are supposed to help you. It's the responsibility of prosecutors and judges to aid you in getting support orders and enforcing them. You can turn to support groups whose members know exactly what you are going through and can help you cope with the system.</p><p>In the end, it's up to you to help find him and make him pay. Because you have the most at stake, you may have to become a squeaky wheel and pester child support officials to get your case moving.</p><p>There are countless mothers who have made the system work for them. You will read vignettes about some of those women and how they triumphed, often by the force of their will.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b></p><p> Co-authors Lou Rose and Roy Malone are retired investigative reporters at the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> who have won awards for stories involving public corruption and social issues.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.78 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/32/9780960684632.jpg,Success,100.0,21.5

Cristina Rathbone spent a year at New York City's West Side High School. Hanging out with the kids in classrooms and in the halls, on street corners and in gang meetings, she gets to know the hidden narratives of their lives and comes to admire their courage and dazzling cool. There is Rasheem, for example, a gifted artist whose extravagant wardrobe is a cover for his homelessness and poverty; Roland, whose menagerie of reptiles has earned him a reputation as the ""Dr. Doolittle of the South Bronx""; and Sandra, a bright Latina who finds an outlet for her ambition only by joining one of the city's largest youth gangs. And then there is Manny Martinez, a charming, soft-spoken drug dealer who has always wanted to be a refrigerator repairman, but who eventually ends up in prison. Moving beyond the role of a journalist to that of a potential caregiver, Rathbone must soon confront not only West Side's limitations but her own.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.15081300764 pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/64/9780871137364.jpg,Success,112.0,21.5

Bill Gates builds a $50 million mansion while food pantries and homeless shelters overflow with the desperate. The explosive expansion of media and cyber conglomerates creates dreamworlds while the ecology of our actual world is jeopardized. Public space and public democracy withers, as is evidenced by the fact that the closest facsimile of a town square is the local Barnes and Noble.<P> New geographies of power are defined by sex scandals, plant closings, cyberporn, sweatshop labor, information webs, and stock market schizophrenia. Global capitalism and its cyberrelations use this chaos to construct modern forms of sexual and racial exploitation.<P> Into this world steps Zillah Eisenstein, with a book of profound despair and yet also great hope, informed by her trademark sharp analysis and her unrelenting passion for a more humane world. Exposing the purported democratic effect of new media for the global mirage it is, Eisenstein shows how transnational capital and its patriarchal obsessions threaten us all, while at the same time creating possibilities for a new democratic society.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>A noted feminist and professor of politics at Ithaca College, Eisenstein (The Female Body and the Law) here combines concern for Third World women and girls with political statistics designed to jar First World readers out of what she sees as deplorable apathy. Striving to investigate global capitalism, patriarchy, new media and feminism's place in a technologically focused society, Eisenstein also explores sex scandals, Princess Diana memorabilia, Marxism, dysfunctional families, state parks, Chernobyl and cyber-anonymity. Her insight and carefully directed rage surrounding topics such as sweatshops and telecommunications law is obscured by diatribes about Gennifer Flowers and Pizza Hut. After these lengthy harangues, she switches from accuser to hopeful dreamer, outlining possibilities for worldwide gender and economic equality and cyber equity, citing advances such as the rise of the ""grrrl movement"" and electronic spaces for women such as FemiNet Korea. Although her passion is admirable and her research impeccable, Eisenstein's ambitious, all-inclusive method and penchant for rant tend to drown the messages she is trying to convey, and prevent deep analysis. She proves adept at delineating the political and economic issues surrounding cyberspace, but will have a tough time here with the unconverted.

Out Of Something Terrible, Something New, Gordimer Writes, To Be Lived With In A Different Way, Surely, Than Life Was Before? Her Text Is Willfully Disjointed, Dissociative And Opaque, And It's Peppered With Questions, He/she Ruminations, Endless Ambiguities And Hyphens Run Amok In The European Manner. It's All Writing, Anyhow, Tailor-made For The Deconstructionists, Among Whom Gordimer Is Already A Hero Thanks To Her Well-known Distrust Of Conventional Narrative:  -- Unfortunately.

It is also the story of Anna's parents: her mother, a woman as remote as she is seductive, and her father, a misogynist army officer who, when Anna cries, tells her, ""We are not born to be comforted."" <p>As Anna picks her way through this emotional minefield, she encounters people and animals that possess the revelatory powers of figures in a dream: the snakes her father's adjutant kills as emmissaries of the Devil; a poetry loving general; a haunted girl whose mother dies of tuberculosis; a frozen crow that miraculously comes back to life. <i>God's Snake</i> is a work filled with passion, magic, and terror, conceived by a novelist of visionary authority.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Anna is a Greek Army brat following her father from posting to posting throughout Greece just after the Civil War. These years of painful deprivation, spent observing her parents' cruel and loveless marriage, teach her the importance of love in adult life. Exploring emotion, especially through her extended family of aunts, uncles, and grandparents, she attempts to discover an adult role for her changing body and sense of self. Spanidou brilliantly portrays Anna's haunting experience in this remarkable first novel. Eschewing chronology for zoology, she reveals Anna through the various animals she encounters, allowing the child's innocence to touch on allegories that pass into knowledge. A prose style as spare and beautiful as the Greek countryside it describes makes this work pleasing as well as thought-provoking. -- Paul E.

<p>Felice, I love you! What a feeling it is to be able to say that! Oh, Felice, the nicest fate I could hope for is that of lasting happiness. I want to live with you for a long, a very long time, do you hear? And life is so beautiful, so wonderful. Felice, do you belong to me - without limit? To me only? Please say you do, at least for a very long time to come, please! Do you love me? I'm acting like a seventeen-year-old, arent't I?</p>

Because before me, like some emblem,<br>
I carry the copper gleam of your hair.</p>

<p>January 30th, 1943, the tenth anniversary of Hitler's seizure of power, Hermann Göring's speech to Berliners was delayed for two hours because British scout planes were flying over the city in broad daylight for the first time. Four days after Göring declared his certainty of victory, the remaining German troops trapped in Stalingrad capitulated. Accompanied by funereal music, the defeat was announced on the radio. On February 18th Reichspropaganda minister Goebbels spurred the German people to make a greater effort. In a ""Declaration of fanatical Will"" at the Berlin Sportpalast he announced the ""Salvation of Germany and the whole of civilisation"" through ""total war"". In memory of the victims of the Russian campaign, a three minute traffic stoppage was declared.

Taking issue with those who point to an expanding black middle class as evidence of greater racial equality, <b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> demonstrates how an analysis of wealth--total assets and debts rather than income alone--uncovers a qualitatively different story about race in America. Providing a comprehensive examination of how material assets are created, expanded and preserved, authors Oliver and Shapiro reveal the persistent and deep economic divide between blacks and whites.<p><b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> charts the ways inequality has been structured over many generations through the same systematic barriers that have affected blacks throughout their history in America--the legacy of slavery, history of low wages, poor education, restriction of blacks as economic free agents. Oliver and Shapiro examine how and why low black entrepreneurship, limited access to capital, red-lining practices, local and state policy, the rise of the modern suburb and the making of the urban ghetto have discouraged and impaired the ability of many blacks to accumulate wealth and opportunities for a better life.<p>Combining quantitative data from over 12,000 households and in-depth interviews with a range of black and white families, the authors measure and conceptualize the racial face of wealth in America. The findings uncover vast differences between blacks and whites&#58; 63% of black households have no financial assets, more than twice the rate of whites; nearly three-quarters of black children grow up in households without any financial resources; the white middle class could support its present standard of living for more than four months without a steady stream of income while the typical black middle class household does not have enough wealth to survive a month. The recent movement of blacks into middle class occupations and gains in educational attainment have not led to commensurate increases in wealth. The racial legacy of the past is etched in present day deprivation of wealth. The authors argue that black achievement at any given level not only requires a greater effort and provides fewer opportunities along the way, but also bestows substantially diminished rewards.<p>The final section of <b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> identifies and explores the factors, processes and structures behind the vast inequality between the two races and analyzes why wealth portfolios for blacks and whites of equal stature and accomplishment vary so differently. Pointing up the failure of current public policies to redress the problem--because they are based on a restrictive concept of income--the authors' analysis provides insight into some of the real reasons behind racial inequality and articulates ways to link opportunity structures to policies that promote asset formation and narrow the racial wealth gap.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Racial comparisons by income are misleading, argue these two sociologists, because the black middle class lags far behind its white counterpart in terms of assets that can expand choices and opportunities for generations to come. Their analysis provides telling insight into the causes and persistence of American racial inequality: government policies of suburbanization and redlining helped boost wealth for whites over blacks, while discrimination against blacks long kept them from developing assets through self-employment. The authors' study uncovers ``the buried fault line of the American social system,'' and they note that three times as many whites as blacks grow up in households with three months of financial reserves. Because of such intergenerational transfers of wealth, the authors make a philosophical case for racial reparations but also argue for more feasible policies, such as government-supplemented accounts to make education and home-ownership more available, as well as the modification of tax policies (mortgage deductions, capital gains) that subsidize the rich.

McHugh established herself as a major writer of humanist sf, one of the most distinctive and talented to emerge this decade. She reaffirms her mastery with a brilliantly imagined and slyly subversive tale of personal and planetary transformation; the story of an exemplary young woman's awakening on a world hauntingly similar to, yet far distant in space and time from our own. 
<p>Young Janna has lived her 14 years on the icy northern plains of a world that has forgotten its history. Now the arrival of alien offworlders -- identical in appearance to her own kind but far different in thought and culture -- has violently upset the fragile balance of a developing civilization. The Earther's advanced technology and cruel indifference to local life has brought despair and destruction to Janna's home, robbing her of family, husband, and child...self. But with the cataclysmic end of everything she has ever known comes the opportunity -- unsought and unwanted -- for rebirth.</p>
<p>Haunted by a dead past -- mysteriously altered by the gift of three offworld artifacts -- Janna must now redefine herself on a devastated planet she no longer recognizes. Disguised as a young boy, she begins a remarkable, transcendent journey into an uncertain future; finding pain and brief solace in her love of a dangerous criminal; miraculously discovering the spirit of her dead child in the soul of a machine. For Janna -- like the strange world around her -- is changing, growing, becoming something extraordinary, solid and real, as she moves steadily toward an astonishing realization about herself and her role in the great cosmic order.</p>

So powerful that even the other gods and goddesses cannot defy them, the Fates are said to control the thread of each life. The ancient Europeans knew the secrets of communicating with the three sisters who preside over our daily lives, but such arcane knowledge has been lost in modern times.<br>
<br>
In Northern Europe the Fates are known as the Norns: Urdh, Verdandi, and Skuld. The sisters correspond to the past (what has been), the present (what is now), and the future (what must be). The three in turn rule our lives in thirty-year cycles—childhood and young adulthood are ruled by Urdh, adulthood by Verdandi, and the crone years by Skuld. The Fates are especially active at the major life turning points, when we receive new missions for our life's work. These main turning points occur in the early thirties and late fifties when restlessness with your previous life can take on a sense of extreme urgency. At such times, the Fate who oversees your next destiny is reaching out to you. Summoning the Fates is the first book to show how to interact with these primal forces to fulfill the destiny that awaits you. Z. Budapest gives spells, rituals, and prayers to bring the psychological and material support you need into your life.<br>
<br>
Z. uses folk stories from her native Hungary and many other countries, personal anecdotes from real women, historical facts, and ""fate works""—exercises that teach you how to recognize, interact with, and ultimately summon the Fates.

<p>Some of these women are well known, while others will be a welcome addition to this emerging history. These are women who - knowingly or unknowingly - have changed every American's destiny through their contributions as writers, artists, teachers, civic leaders, medical professionals, or entrepreneurs. And there are those who simply represent the collective black experience - from the days of slavery through abolition, the civil rights movement, and beyond.</p>
<p>Blending information and inspiration, author Tonya Bolden has assembled a truly unique collection of the lives of African American women. With quotations from writings of and about many of these remarkable women, she presents an important new historical perspective. The elegance of her writing, and her ability to capture the essence of each individual woman's life, make this an invaluable resource as well as a wonderful gift.</p>",en,,"Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",16.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/73/9781558506473.jpg,Success,49.0,21.5

Washington; Harlem's Golden Age and Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Paul Robeson. Bessie breaks barriers to become a dentist; Sadie quietly integrates the New York City system as a high school teacher. Their extraordinary story makes an important contribution to our nation's heritage&#8212;and an indelible impression on our lives.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this remarkable and charming oral history, two lively and perspicacious sisters, aged 101 and 103, reflect on their rich family life and their careers as pioneering African American professionals. Brief chapters capture Sadie's warm voice (``Now, I was a `mama's child' '') and Bessie's fiestiness (``I'm alive out of sheer determination, honey!''). The unmarried sisters, who live together, tell of growing up on the campus of a black college in Raleigh, N.C., where their father was an Episcopal priest, and of being too independent for the men who courted them. With parental influence far stronger than that of Jim Crow, they joined professions--Sadie teaching domestic science, Bessie practicing dentistry. In 1920s Harlem they mixed with black activists and later were among the first to integrate the New York City suburb of Mount Vernon. While their account of the last 40 years is sketchy, their observations about everything from black identity to their yoga exercises make them worthwhile company. Freelancer Hearth, who wrote an initial story on the sisters in the New York Times in 1991, has deftly shaped and contextualized their reflections.

Gates highlights the contributions of Victorian and Edwardian women to the study, protection, and writing of nature. Recovering their works from the misrepresentation they often faced at the time of their composition, Gates discusses not just well-known women like Beatrix Potter but also others—scientists, writers, gardeners, and illustrators—who are little known today.</p>
<p>Some of these women discovered previously unknown species, others wrote and illustrated natural histories or animal stories, and still others educated women, the working classes, and children about recent scientific advances. A number of women also played pivotal roles in the defense of animal rights by protesting overhunting, vivisection, and habitat destruction, even as they demanded their own rights to vote, work, and enter universities.</p>

And it is true; the center of the Beast's palace, the glittering glasshouse that brings Beauty both comfort and delight in her strange new environment, is filled with leafless brown rosebushes. But deep within this enchanted world, new life, at once subtle and strong, is about to awaken. Twenty years ago Robin McKinley enthralled readers with the power of <i>Beauty.</i> Now this extraordinarily gifted novelist retells the story of Beauty and the Beast again—but in a totally new way, with fresh perspective, ingenuity, and mature insight. In <i>Rose Daughter</i> she has written her finest and most deeply felt work, a compelling, richly imagined, and haunting exploration of the transformative power of love.

                        <p>Beauty grows to love the Beast at whose castle she is compelled to stay, and through her love he is released from the curse that had turned him from man to beast.

0-195-12289-5,Why History Matters: Life and Thought,"Lerner, Gerda",Oxford University Press,272.0,1998-02-26,,Paperback,"<p><P>""All human beings are practicing historians,"" writes Gerda Lerner. ""We live our lives; we tell our stories. It is as natural as breathing."" It is as important as breathing, too. History shapes our self-definition and our relationship to community; it locates us in time and place and helps to give meaning to our lives. History can be the vital thread that holds a nation together, as demonstrated most strikingly in the case of Jewish history. Conversely, for women, who have lived in a world in which they apparently had no history, its absence can be devastating. In <b>Why History Matters</b>, Lerner brings together her thinking and research of the last sixteen years, combining personal reminiscences with innovative theory that illuminate the importance of history and the vital role women have played in it.<br> <b>Why History Matters</b> contains some of the most significant thinking and writing on history that Lerner has done in her entire career&#151;a summation of her life and work. The chapters are divided into three sections, each widely different from the others, each revelatory of Lerner as a woman and a feminist. We read first of Lerner's coming to consciousness as a Jewish woman. There are moving accounts of her early life as a refugee in America, her return to Austria fifty years after fleeing the Nazis (to discover a nation remarkable both for the absence of Jews and for the anti-Semitism just below the surface), her slow assimilation into American life, and her decision to be a historian. If the first section is personal, the second focuses on more professional concerns. Included here is a fascinating essay on nonviolent resistance, tracing the idea from the Quakers (such as Mary Dyer), to abolitionists such as Theodore Dwight Weld (the ""most mobbed man"" in America), to Thoreau's essay <b>Civil Disobedience</b>, then across the sea to Tolstoy and Gandhi, before finally returning to America during the civil rights movement of the 1950s. There are insightful essays on ""American Values"" and on the tremendous advances women have made in the twentieth century, as well as Lerner's presidential address to the Organization of American Historians, which outlines the contributions of women to the field of history and the growing importance of women as a subject of history. The highlight of the final section of the book is Lerner's bold and innovative look at the issues of class and race as they relate to women, an essay that distills her thinking on these difficult subjects and offers a coherent conceptual framework that will prove of lasting interest to historians and intellectuals.<br> A major figure in women's studies and long-term activist for women's issues, a founding member of NOW and a past president of the Organization of American Historians, Gerda Lerner is a pioneer in the field of Women's History and one of its leading practitioners. <b>Why History Matters</b> is the summation of the work and thinking of this distinguished historian.</p> <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3> <p>Despite its somewhat grandiose title, this isn't in any way a comprehensive approach to the vital question posed, but a collection of speeches and articles that offer only a glimpse of the author's important contributions to historical inquiry.<P>Lerner (The Creation of Feminist Consciousness, 1993; Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison) is a fascinating woman, and some of her extraordinary experiences are revealed here in the portion of the book called ""Life."" An Austrian Jew, Lerner escaped from the Nazis and emigrated to America at age 18. Once here, she determined to be a writer and set about gaining a proficiency in English the likes of which few native-born Americans can boast. But Lerner didn't stop there. At the age of 40, she returned to school to get a graduate degree in history&#151;and not conventional history, but women's history, an area of study that she helped define. In another section, called ""Thought,"" Lerner discusses the field of women's history a little, but these essays, collected from her writings and lectures of the past few years are limited in scope and often repetitive. (For instance, we hear many times that women cannot be treated as a single, unified category because they come from all classes, races, and religions.) This is not to say that Lerner offers nothing of value. For example, her discussions of how to put women into the history curriculum without making them seem inferior to men are perceptive and thoughtful, as is her attempt to redefine race and class in terms of gender.<P> Even here Lerner has much to offer students of history, but from a scholar of her stature, this jumble of essays is a disappointment.<P></p>",en,Revised,"Height: 0.7 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.77382253962 Pounds, Width: 5.5 Inches",28.4,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/93/9780195122893.jpg,Success,51.0,21.5

Roediger has brought together some of the most important black writers throughout history to explore the question&#58; What does it really mean to be white in America?<br><br>From folktales and slave narratives to contemporary essays, poetry, and fiction, black writers have long been among America's keenest students of white consciousness and white behavior, but until now much of this writing has been ignored.&#160;&#160;<b>Black on White</b> reverses this trend by presenting the work of more than fifty major figures, including James Baldwin, Derrick Bell, Ralph Ellison, W.E.B. Du Bois, bell hooks, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker to take a closer look at the many meanings of whiteness in our society.<br><br>Rich in irony, artistry, passion, and common sense, these reflections on what Langston Hughes called &quot;the ways of white folks&quot; illustrate how whiteness as a racial identity derives its meaning not as a biological category but as a social construct designed to uphold racial inequality. Powerful and compelling, Black on White provides a much-needed perspective that is sure to have a major impact on the study of race and race relations in America.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>These two books belong to a growing body of work that examines white identity through African American writings. Historian Roediger (Towards the Abolition of Whiteness, Norton, 1994) here collects illuminating views of ""whiteness"" from black writers ranging from such early figures as the revolutionary David Walker to contemporaries like Toni Morrison. Some of the expected sources are here, including James Baldwin's Going To Meet the Man and Richard Wright's Black Boy, but among several delightful surprises are George S. Schuyler's essay ""Our White Folks"" and Alice Walker's ""The Dummy in the Window: Joel Chandler Harris and the Invention of Uncle Remus."" Although the anthology includes a range of perspectives, Roediger has essentially excluded ""the more reflexively antiwhite tradition represented (at times) by the nation of Islam, or by Leonard Jeffries's recent writing on whites."" This results in some notable omissions, including Malcom X. Still, this is a valubable collection that should go a long way in helping us to understand America's troubled racial relations. Recommended for all collections. Sartwell (philosophy, Pennsylvania State Univ.) analyzes the perception of whiteness in the slave narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and Malcolm X, and contemporary rap music. He contends that whites, in seeking to establish their identity as the norm, ultimately render themselves invisible. Furthermore, white identity is typically constructed in comparison with nonwhite identities, often portraying the latter as inferior, he notes. Through the writings of African Americans, Sartwell believes whiteness can be viewed in a more objective manner. At the same time that he seeks to elucidate the texts, he grapples with his own whiteness. In the process, he has presented an engaging though disturbing investigation of the complex politics of identity. Recommended for academic libraries.Louis J.

<br>
Dead March is the first in an exciting new mystery series that takes place during the Civil War. It is the spring of 1861. Though the War Between the States is in its infancy, Richmond, Virginia, is not free of violent death, as two astute and courageous women from opposite ends of society discover when a grave is robbed, yielding the murdered body of a young slave woman. The silk scarf left carelessly with her body leads to suspects from every echelon of Richmond society--and to more deaths. Narcissa Powers, a young white widow, begins to investigate and is soon aided by Judah Daniel, a free black herbalist and conjure woman. As the War's casualties begin to pour into the city and the ""Dead March"" echoes through the streets, the mystery deepens, and Narcissa and Judah must risk their lives to find the killer--or killers--and save the life of an innocent child. With its well-paced suspense and fascinating characters, Dead March is both an elegant mystery and a moving evocation of the Old South.<br>

<p>At a time when over half of all marriages are ending in divorce, Daphne Rose Kingma, a well-known therapist and relationship expert, has recognized that our familiar ways of thinking about relationships are no longer working.&nbsp;&nbsp;""I have written this book because it is clear that many of our previous assumptions about relationships need to be dismantled,"" writes Kingma.&nbsp;&nbsp;""As we go through this process, we will discover a number of new ideas: that our relationships can have different forms than we ever imagined; that they will serve different purposes; that they will require different offerings from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also bring us new gifts.""</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a sea change, in which not only are many traditional relationships failing, but unexpected new arrangements are beginning to appear; gay marriages are surfacing, step-families abound, and many people are consciously choosing to live alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kingma explains, these transformations should not be feared; instead, they represent a real opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, conventional relationships were often destroyed by an overemphasis on the nuts and bolts of psychology, on working to achieve the unattainable ""perfect relationship"" while ignoring our most vital selves—our souls.&nbsp;&nbsp;The glorious message of <i>The Future of Love</i> is that the disturbing changes we are all experiencing are actually part of the soul's plan, as it breaks down outdated conventions to bring us a new, fuller understanding of love.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.23 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/49/9780385490849.jpg,Success,113.0,21.5

In this unique antidote to public perception, Kathleen F. Slevin and C. Ray Wingrove focus on the experiences of an unusual group of pioneers: one of the first generations of African American women to work as white-collar professionals, retire in considerable comfort, and remain actively and fruitfully involved, as older women, in their respective communities.
<p> Through the voices of these women, we come to understand the impact of social systems on individual lives and to appreciate how the legacies provided these women by their families, teachers, churches, and communities endowed them with the survival tools needed to succeed, despite the prejudice and ""stumbling blocks"" they encountered along the way. Slevin and Wingrove explore how the lessons of childhood-choosing battles, avoiding hurtful Whites, striving for economic independence, and projecting self-confidence and racial pride-translate to adulthood as they recount the ups and downs of being successful African American women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches",27.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/05/9780814781005.jpg,Success,102.0,21.5
0-8139-1833-2,Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,"Gordon-Reed, Annette",University of Virginia Press,320.0,1998,,Paperback,"<p><P>Now updated with a new author's note about the recent DNA study confirming the Jefferson-Hemings liaison<P>Rumors of Thomas Jefferson's sexual involvement with his slave Sally Hemings have circulated for two centuries. It remains, among all aspects of Jefferson's renowned life, perhaps the most hotly contested topic. With Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, Annette Gordon-Reed promises to intensify this ongoing debate as she identifies glaring inconsistencies in many noted scholars' evaluations of the existing evidence. She has assembled a fascinating and convincing argument&#58; not that the alleged thirty-eight-year liaison necessarily took place but rather that the evidence for its taking place has been denied a fair hearing.<P>Friends of Jefferson sought to debunk the Hemings story as early as 1800, and most subsequent historians and biographers have followed suit, finding the affair unthinkable based upon their view of Jefferson's life, character, and beliefs. Gordon-Reed responds to these critics by pointing out numerous errors and prejudices in their writings, ranging from inaccurate citations, to impossible time lines, to virtual exclusions of evidence&#151;especially evidence concerning the Hemings family. She demonstrates how these scholars may have been misguided by their own biases and may even have tailored evidence to serve and preserve their opinions of Jefferson.<P>Possessing both a layperson's unfettered curiosity and a lawyer's logical mind, Annette Gordon-Reed writes with a style and compassion that are irresistible. Each chapter revolves around a key figure in the Hemings drama, and the resulting portraits are engrossing and very personal. Gordon-Reed also brings a keen intuitive sense of the psychological complexities of human relationships&#151;relationships that, in the real world, often develop regardless of status or race. The most compelling element of all, however, is her extensive and careful research, which often allows the evidence to speak for itself. Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings is a controversial new look at a centuries-old question that should fascinate general readers and historians alike. It promises to be the definitive word on the subject for years to come.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Gordon-Reed takes on the historians who would deny that Thomas Jefferson had a 38-year relationship with Sally Hemings, one of his slaves, and she does so both by presenting historical evidence of that relationship and by critiquing their denials. While her account is reasoned and logical, Gordon-Reed is a law professor (at New York Law School) who writes like a lawyer. She justifies this legalistic tone in her preface by pointing out that historians often use legal phrases when debating the controversy, but that doesn't make this dry presentation of the facts any more readable. Primary sources (Madison Hemings's recounting of his mother's relationship with Jefferson, in which he claims Jefferson as his father; the memoirs of Israel Jefferson, a former slave of Jefferson's who corroborated Hemings's story; and a pair of letters discussing the Jefferson-Hemings relationship) are the most lively reading, but they have been banished to an appendix. Gordon-Reed approaches the various players in this drama chapter by chapter and dissects the collective denial of traditional historians with regard to each. She not only handily refutes theories such as the idea that one of Jefferson's nephews, either Samuel Carr or Peter Carr, fathered Hemings's children, but points out the racism inherent in insisting, for example, that Madison Hemings's story of his life cannot be correct because the language is too sophisticated. Her contention that ""Thomas Jefferson's racism was not extraordinary"" is believable and intriguing, but too much that is of interest here becomes obfuscated by legal devices, including a chapter titled ""Summary of the Evidence.""

When she discovers him in bed with his estranged wife, she must strike out again - and alone - into the maelstrom of terror and risk that Beijing has become. In the ensuing months, as she is all but overwhelmed by painful memories of the past and by the turmoil of the present, she goes through a kind of sea change: sexual freedom and erotic liberation seem to be the only freedoms left to her, but these, too, may lead to betrayal, and she must find her bearings on her own.

Long after her husband is institutionalized, Molly moves her children from the west of Ireland to Dublin. She is following her eldest daughter Aisling—- her favorite, the beloved—- who is to attend college there. But one summer Aisling disappears. Fifteen years later, Molly persuades the youngest and most reliable of her five children, Keelin, to put her own life on hold to search for Aisling. Traveling the world with various of her siblings, Keelin learns that each is cursed with their father's affliction—- ""the doubting disease,"" as they call it. In one way or another, each is paralyzed and compelled to perform irrational acts. In pursuit of her wild, elusive sister, whose personality defies categorization, Keelin takes on a hip and decadent Japan, a talk-show-worthy United States, and a surreal Central America. Many curious adventures, an uncertain reunion, and a stunning betrayal later, Keelin is forced to question the familial attachments that have always driven her. More Bread or I'll Appear casts a unique eye on the issues of gender, race, and class that are vital to contemporary culture.

<p>Wounds of Passion is a memoir about writing, love, and sexuality. With her customary boldness and insight, Bell Hooks critically reflects on the impact of birth control and the women's movement on our lives. Resisting the notion that love and writing don't mix, she begins a fifteen-year relationship with a gifted poet and scholar, who inspires and encourages her. Writing the acclaimed book Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism at the age of nineteen, she begins to emerge as a brilliant social critic and public intellectual. Wounds of Passion describes a woman's struggle to devote herself to writing, sharing the difficulties, the triumphs, the pleasures, and the dangers. Eloquent and powerful, this book lets us see the ways one woman writer works to find her own voice while creating a love relationship based on feminist thinking. With courage and wisdom she reveals intimate details and provocative ideas, offering an illuminating vision of a writer's life.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.83 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",23.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/25/9780805057225.jpg,Success,56.0,21.5

<p>It is often said that the best comedy springs from hard times.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rita Mae Brown has seen plenty of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this irresistibly readable memoir, she recounts the drama of her birth as the illegitimate daughter of a flighty blue blood who left her in an orphanage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sickly baby was quickly rescued by relatives eager to adopt her but afraid she would not survive the long journey home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her determination to live, and shock everyone by doing it, has become a metaphor for her entire life.</p>
<p>Though raised by these loving adoptive parents and a wacky host of other interfering kin, Rita Mae Brown learned early on to be tough and to speak her mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was her refusal to be anything but herself that often brought her the most trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here she tells of her tempestuous relationship with her adoptive mother, the mythic Juts of the novels <i>Six of One</i> and <i>Bingo,</i> who called her ""the ill,"" for illegitimate, whenever she lost her temper, and who swore she'd introduce Rita Mae to the social graces, including the dreaded cotillion, even if it killed them both.</p>
<p>Here, too, Rita Mae reveals how her headstrong support of social causes almost cost her a hard-earned education and her outspokenness in the early days of the women's movement got her drummed out of NOW, and how the release of her first novel, the scandalous classic <i>Rubyfruit Jungle,</i> made her an overnight phenomenon--the most famous openly gay person in America--and took her from the heights of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list to the surreal playhouse that is Hollywood.</p>
<p>Through it all, Rita Mae has drawn strength from her profound bond with animals, from her abiding affection for the South and its native tongue, and from the great passions of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;She writes with close-to-the-bone honesty about woman-woman love...including her love-at-first-sight relationship with a popular actor and her headline-making romance with tennis great Martina Navratilova.&nbsp;&nbsp;With her trademark humor, she unflinchingly bares her own flaws, flouting public opinion yet displaying the unflappable good sense that shows through everything she writes.</p>
<p>A look into a woman's mind and a writer's irrepressible spirit, <i>Rita Will</i> is quintessential Rita Mae Brown--a book that feels like a kick-your-shoes-off visit with an old friend.</p>

Warning the women's movement against dissolving into factionalism, male-bashing, and preoccupation with sexual and identity politics rather than bottom-line political and economic inequalities, Friedan argues that once past the initial phases of describing and working against political and economic injustices, the women's movement should focus on working with men to remake private and public arrangements that work against full lives with children for women and men both. Friedan's agenda to preserve families is far more radical than it appears, for she argues that a truly equitable preservation of marriage and family may require a reorganization of many aspects of conventional middle-class life, from the greater use of flex time and job-sharing, to company-sponsored daycare, to new home designs to permit communal housekeeping and cooking arrangements.</p>
<p>Called ""utopian"" fifteen years ago, when it seemed unbelievable that women had enough power in the workplace to make effective demands, or that men would join them, some of these visions are slowly but steadily coming to pass even now. The problem Friedan identifies is as real now as it was years ago: ""how to live the equality we fought for,"" and continue to fight for, with ""the family as new feminist frontier."" She writes not only for women's liberation but for human liberation.</p>


                        <p>This classic work provides a vision and blueprint for the women's movement. An afterward by Friedan offers a ten point program for launching the second stage of the movement.

Avoiding the easy cliche of victimhood and oppression, he searches for answers through three unexpected, overlapping, intensely personal stories. Ultimately he presents a vision of a nation where the futures of blacks and whites are as linked as their histories, and where black experience offers a key to the struggle of every modern American. American Beach opens with the killing of an unarmed black motorist by white police on a Florida resort island. It's the emblematic race confrontation of the 1990s, but Rymer's examination turns up everything but the ordinary. His journey leads us through ghostly plantation cemeteries, seance parlors, black resorts, European opera houses, Harlem salons, America's newest town, and its oldest incorporated black city. Along the way, we are guided by the most extraordinary real-life Southern cast since Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, including Florida's first black millionaire and his great-granddaughter, a flamboyant pauper who lives on a chaise lounge on the beach, from whence she strives to salvage her history and rescue her imperiled culture.

Through an extensive reading of literary and historical documents, Dana D. Nelson analyzes the social and political articulation of a civic identity centered around the white male and points to a cultural moment in which the theoretical consolidation of white manhood worked to ground, and perhaps even found, the nation.<br>
	Using political, scientific, medical, personal, and literary texts ranging from the Federalist papers to the ethnographic work associated with the Lewis and Clark expedition to the medical lectures of early gynecologists, Nelson explores the referential power of white manhood, how and under what conditions it came to stand for the nation, and how it came to be a fraternal articulation of a representative and civic identity in the United States. In examining early exemplary models of national manhood and by tracing its cultural generalization, <i>National Manhood</i> reveals not only how an impossible ideal has helped to form racist and sexist practices, but also how this ideal has simultaneously privileged and oppressed white men, who, in measuring themselves against it, are able to disavow their part in those oppressions.<br>

Compellingly and compassionately written, it is based on more than six years of firsthand research and reporting by a leading investigative journalist. It brings fully to life the medical, legal, and ethical controversies that surround end-of-life care, showing exactly how they affect individuals and families. It also explores the psychological and spiritual realities that are at the heart of our longing for ""death with dignity."" Marilyn Webb combines a journalist's objectivity with a passionate advocacy for people in pain. Building her account around intimate portraits of the dying themselves, she also introduces us to leading doctors, hospice workers and medical ethicists, legal experts and pain specialists, advocates of assisted suicide - and their determined opponents. She explains why some deaths become shockingly difficult - including the refusal of many physicians to prescribe legal pain relief, and the struggles over end-of-life, decisions that pit patient and family against medical institutions, insurance companies, religious groups, and government. But there is abundant good news as well. Webb describes many extraordinary programs and visionary individuals who are changing the face of dying. The essential elements of a humane - even uplifted - death are available to all of us, if we know what is possible, where to go for help, and how to prepare. The Good Death is both a blueprint for change and a book of comfort and hope for everyone concerned about dying.

Reagan, an assistant professor of history, medicine and women's studies at the University of Illinois, dedicates her disturbing work on abortion in America before Roe v. Wade to 'the lives of... women who died trying to control their reproduction.' She chronicles the covert efforts and subsequent prosecution of doctors and midwives, and of unmarried women and their lovers (while married women made up the majority of clientele and were accused of 'race suicide,' they were pursued less often). Reagan has her work cut out for her: Though the law forbade abortions, she writes, 'some late-19th-century doctors believed there were two million abortions [performed] every year.' And then, as now, debate raged: though some doctors disagreed, the Journal of the American Medical Association declared itself against abortion in the case of rape since 'pregnancy is rare after real rape.'

A powrful act of witness to the brutal realities of segregation.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this warmhearted, well-observed memoir, the national correspondent for the MacNeil-LehrerNewsHour reflects on her childhood and young adulthood, including her historic role as one of two black students who desegregated the University of Georgia in 196 1. Dwelling a bit too much on her family history and descriptions of the southern towns where she grew up, Hunter-Gault identifies many of the forces that shaped her: strong teachers, good friends and a dignified father struggling as a chaplain in a racist Army. After attending a largely white school in Alaska, she spent her high school years in the supportive black environment of L.A.-Lovely Atlanta. She downplays her heroism at the University of Georgia in order to highlight the heady but humbling feelings she derived from other blacks' pride in her. She tells of harassment and support in those dramatic years, as well as of her growth as a journalist, her public speaking tours and even her romance with a white Southerner. She concludes, a bit awkwardly, with the commencement address she delivered at her alma mater in 1988; this work hints, however, that Hunter-Gault could write a rich sequel.

This glorious book celebrates the history of women healers from earliest times to the present. It includes profiles of women healers from all traditions. Some are well known, such as Hildegard of Bingen, Florence Nightingale, and Mary Baker Eddy. Others deserve to be more widely recognized, such as Trotula of Salerno, who wrote gynecological and obstetrical texts in thirteenth-century Italy, and Mama Lola, a respected mambo or healing priestess in the Haitian Voodoo tradition. Text and pictures detail the many contributions of women to the healing arts, from the founding of nursing orders and the tending of soldiers, to the establishment of public health hospitals, to contemporary applications of the ancient lore of herbal medicine and therapeutic touch. <p></p>",en,1,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",20.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/13/9780835607513.jpg,Success,51.0,21.5

Mallon permits the voices of these young people to guide the research, allowing them to tell their own stories and to suggest what is important in their own words.

0-684-80160-4,Serpent's Gift,"Lee, Helen Elaine",Scribner,384.0,1995-10-01,,Paperback,"<p>One of the most striking and heartening developments in American letters in recent years has been the flowering and attendant celebration of African-American writers and of books that have introduced to readers everywhere people, situations, and events that have, hitherto, largely been ignored, denied, or unknown. Now comes Helen Elaine Lee's supremely assured <i>The Serpent's Gift,</i> a first novel that gives to us — with the fullest emotional resonance, humor, and exultation in the novelist's art — the intertwined stories of two families from early in this century to our own times.</p>
<p>Central to this haunting (and sometimes haunted) novel are the mothers, a study in contrast in strength and rigidity, Ruby Staples and Eula Smalls, and their children: LaRue Smalls, adventurer, storyteller, and chronicler of his people; his sister Vesta, intimidated by life from an early age, yet determined, valiant even, to hold her disparate family together; and Ouida Staples, a rare beauty who elects, in the face of convention, to spend her life with another woman. Each will face trials and challenges and sometimes be transformed, shedding like the serpent, an old skin, reborn by the art of invention.</p>
<p> From its opening pages, which recount in eerily compelling detail, the death that will bring these people together, to its almost pastoral conclusion, <i>The Serpent's Gift</i> creates a world that is both realistic in its detail and lyrical in its presentation — it is a superb, triumphant debut.</p>


                        <p>A lyrical, multigenerational story about two African-American families, written by a writer who captivates in the tradition of Toni Morrison and Gloria Naylor. Tracing the lives of the highly memorable matriarchs of the Staples and Smalls families over nearly a century, Lee creates a world that is starkly real and magically haunting.

Yet, it's the distance readers may sense between the type of noncommercial artistic commitment Bambara embodied and today's more prevalent exploitation of black culture by black artists, in the name of entertainment, that stretches ominous and still.

<p>A hundred years ago, women were lacing themselves into corsets and teaching their daughters to do the same. The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?</p>
<p>In <b>The Body Project</b>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance—in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <b>The Body Project</b> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism—a world in which the body is their primary project.</p>

<p>Gayl Jones's first novel, <i>Corregidora</i>, won her recognition as a writer whose work was gripping, subtle, and sure. It was praised, along with her second novel, <i>Eva's Man</i>, by writers and critics from all over the nation: John Updike, Maya Angelou, John Edgar Wideman, and James Baldwin, to name a few. The publication of <i>The Healing</i>, her first novel in over twenty years, is a literary event.</p>
<p>Harlan Jane Eagleton is a faith healer, traveling by bus to small towns, converting skeptics, restoring minds and bodies. But before that she was a minor rock star's manager, and before that a beautician. She's had a fling with her rock star's ex-husband and an Afro-German horse dealer; along the way she's somehow lost her own husband, a medical anthropologist now traveling with a medicine woman in Africa. Harlan tells her story from the end backwards, drawing us constantly deeper into her world and the mystery at the heart of her tale-the story of her first healing.</p>
<p><i>The Healing</i> is a lyrical and at times humorous exploration of the struggle to let go of pain, anger, and even love. Slipping seamlessly back through Harlan's memories in a language rich with the textured cadences of the black Southerner, Gayl Jones weaves her story to its dramatic-and unexpected-beginning.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.31 Pounds, Width: 0.74 Inches",23.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/55/9780807063255.jpg,Success,114.0,21.5

<p>Ecofeminism is a practical movement for social change that discerns interconnections among all forms of oppression: the exploitation of nature, the oppression of women, class exploitation, racism, colonialism. Against binary divisions such as self/other, culture/nature, man/woman, humans/animals, and white/non-white, ecofeminist theory asserts that human identity is shaped by more fluid relationships and by an acknowledgment of both connection and difference.</p>
<p>Once considered the province of philosophy and women's studies, ecofeminism in recent years has been incorporated into a broader spectrum of academic discourse.

Poetry. Latino/Latina Studies. Young Adult. ""Returning to the territory covered in An Island Like You and SILENT DANCING, Cofer further heightens her descriptions of barrio life with a pervasive current of sensuality and rebellion in this volume of poems and stories about growing up during the turbulent 1960s. Most of the stories are described in hindsight by narrator Mary Ellen, who is also known as Maria Elenita (however, readers may have trouble keeping track of the various narrators in the early stories—which are all told through first-person narration but from differing ages and perspectives). Caught between Hispanic and American lifestyles, and eager to break free of traditional Hispanic values, Mary Ellen is strongly attracted to things that are alien to her parents. Readers will likely relate to Mary Ellen's struggle for independence, her idealism and her need for answers, themes that Cofer carries through the entire collection. In ""The Meaning of El Amor,"" for example, the narrator sneaks into a nightclub where her recently deceased father, ""the Puerto Rican Romeo,"" moonlighted to find out why love causes so much suffering. Cofer's lyrical descriptions of how music and the Vietnam War fired Mary Ellen's youthful passions are affecting: ""When she was deep into a song, Janis [Joplin] became beautiful. Her voice, hoarse and choked with pain, went right through my skin, and I began to understand the meaning of soul, el duende, in American music."" Readers in the suggested age range may miss the most rewarding aspects of Cofer's work, but for mature teenagers, there is wisdom aplenty in this radiant collection.

Sophie is eager for her marriage to the stable Lynn, believing he will be her anchor, help her in containing what she knows to be her restless and passionate nature.

Isobel's husband&#8212;a gentleman of mature years&#8212;is felled by a mysterious and agonizing ailment. The Earl's death seems a cruel blow of fate for the newly married Isobel. Yet the bereaved widow soon finds that it's only the beginning of her misfortune...as she receives a sinister missive accusing her and the Earl's nephew of adultery&#8212;and murder. Desperately afraid that the letter will expose her to the worst sort of scandal, Isobel begs Jane for help. And Jane finds herself embroiled in a perilous investigation that will soon have her following a trail of clues that leads all the way to Newgate Prison and the House of Lords&#8212;a trail that may well place Jane's own person in the gravest jeopardy.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>With this series opener, Barron catches the Jane Austen popularity wave with impeccable timing-but that may be the best that can be said of this debut. Purportedly editing Austen manuscripts found in an old Maryland estate, Barron recounts the suspicious death of the elderly Frederick Payne, Earl of Scargrave. Anonymous notes accuse Isobel, Austen's friend and Payne's young bride, and a ""grey-hared Lord"" of murdering the earl. Intensifying Isobel's misery is Lord Harold Trowbridge, who badgers the widow to sell him her estate in Barbados. Concerned for her friend and for Fitzroy Payne, the new earl who not-so-secretly loves Isobel, Austen undertakes snooping that leads her to a second corpse and leads Isobel and Fitzroy to trial before the House of Lords. As Austen explores a passel of suspects who are heavy-handedly cast as the originals for the characters in her novels, the reader is offered imitation scholarly footnotes. To be truly helpful, Barron might have better explained how Austen hears Big Ben, a bell cast some 40 years after her death. Austen as mystery writer is an appealing idea, but inadequately served here. Author tour.

Like the sudden moments of illumination in haiku, the moments of being Underhill describes are rooted in the ordinary, but they reveal the extraordinary.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.2499835 Inches, Length: 5.2499895 Inches, Weight: 0.74295782294 Pounds, Width: 0.8499983 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/03/9780820320403.jpg,Success,105.0,21.5

<p>In this provocative new work, Marina Warner goes beyond the terrain she covered in her widely praised <i>From the Beast to the Blonde</i>. She explores the darker, wilder realm where ogres and giants devour children, where bogeymen haunt the night and each of us must face our bugaboos. No Go the Bogeyman considers the enduring presence and popularity of figures of male terror, establishing their origins in mythology and their current relation to ideas about sexuality and power, youth and age.</p>
<p>Songs, stories, images, and films about frightening monsters have always been invented to allay the very terrors that our dreams of reason conjure up. Warner shows how these images and stories, while they may unfold along different lines--scaring, lulling, or making mock-always have the strategic, simultaneous purpose of both arousing and controlling the underlying fear. In a brilliant analysis of material long overlooked by cultural critics, historians, and even psychologists, Warner revises our understanding of storytelling in contemporary culture, of masculine identity, racial stereotyping, and the dangerous, unthinking ways we perpetuate the bogeyman.<br>

But then somehow she was convinced by my father's sisters to make me a lackluster Ruth, in honor of their recently deceased mother, Rose. And so my birth certificate read Ruth Leila, a name I was never called, by my mother, either of my father's sisters or anyone else. So begins the life list of Linda Rosenkrantz, 207 random recollections of her first twelve years that, together, comprise one of the year's most unexpected and delightfully offbeat memoirs. Rich with the sights, sounds, and smells of her sheltered childhood in a Jewish enclave of the Bronx, My Life as a List re-creates the urban experience of American Jews in the years surrounding World War II. The author writes with wry affection of family and friends, of grievances harbored and accomplishments savored, all recalled with the laser particularity of a child's eye. Rosenkrantz's unerring attention to detail imbues these childhood impressions with remarkable clarity. Telling specifics of her girlhood are interwoven with darker undertones of war to lucidly recall the tenuous balance between day-to-day life and wartime sacrifices. Against this background, Rosenkrantz offers humorous anecdotes, touching reminiscences, and lively portraits of her family, friends, and neighbors and period photographs and ephemera from the author's own collection bring her colorful cast of characters even more vividly to life.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/73/9780609603673.jpg,Success,123.0,21.5

1-85984-837-0,Love in a Different Climate : Men Who Have Sex with Men in India,"Seabrook, Jeremy",Verso,192.0,1999-07-17,Multicultural Aspects/Gay & Lesbian Communities,Hardcover,"What does it mean to be Muslim, Bengali or Tamil and to enjoy sex with men? How can a lesbian identity co-exist with Hindu, Islamic or Buddhist values? To what extent is 'gay culture' simply another neo-colonial import from a newly liberalised West? In this carefully researched and finely written work, Jeremy Seabrook deals with subjects rarely discussed in Western narratives about South Asia. Going beyond a straightforward contextualisation of the gatoei (lady-boys) in Thailand and the hijara (eunuchs) of India, he unravels the less familiar and more complex territory of homosexual and homoerotic encounters in general, and asks how valid Western models of sexual identity are in the South Asian context, and how effective they might be in dealing with global issues of sexual health, HIV awareness and gender politics. Much of the book is based on interviews which reveal the extent of the complexity at play: wives who traditionally vacate the marital bed to accommodate their husbands' friends; kotis--'passive' male sex partners of men many of whom will be married but see their relations with the kotis as fulfilling their destinies as males; the fundamentalist politicians who curse the Western influence of 'gay liberation' and continue to justify the punishment of life imprisonment for homosexuality; and the activist groups who are working towards a clearer and more helpful understanding of contemporary issues.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.03396800878 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/71/9781859848371.jpg,Success,129.0,21.5
