The narratives are striking, but the evidence supporting them is uneven at best.

More troubling is Wesson's failure to support her tone of authority. Medical citations are scattered throughout the text, but numerous extremely strong statements (e.g., that there is a ""higher incidence of spina bifida"" in IVF babies) are left completely unreferenced, perhaps with good reason; the source for this particular quote turns out not to be a clinical study but a 1987 letter to the editor of Lancet!

But now that she's living at the Indian residential school her name is Martha Stone, and everything else about her life has changed as well. Told in the honest voice of a sixth grader, this is the story of a young Native girl forced to live in a world governed by strict nuns, arbitrary rules, and a policy against talking in her own dialect, even with her family. Seepeetza finds bright spots, but most of all she looks forward to summers and holidays at home.<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This rather desolate autobiographical novel chronicles a girl's harsh upbringing in an Indian residential school in 1950s British Columbia. Sixth-grader Seepeetza, whose name has been changed to Martha Stone, was only six when she was ripped away from her cozy family farm and plunged into a spartan existence. She and her classmates are beaten with a strap by Sister Superior and threatened not to get out of bed lest the devils grab them and ""drag us into the fires of hell."" Related as entries in Seepeetza's private journal, this book has a devastatingly simple style and conveys tiny details only a person who had been through such a school could know: ""Girls hide bread or raw carrots in their bloomer legs under the elastic. They take it out and eat it late at night when the lights are out. That's when we get really hungry."" The story breaks out of rigid notions of right and wrong-Seepeetza is fond of her father although he drinks; her parents may have sent her away, but they are loving; the nuns are cruel but sometimes inexplicably kind; Seepeetza finds moments of happiness in her dancing amid the general oppression. Though the nave tone of the journal slightly distances the reader, the smoldering intensity and unvarnished details still assume a mature sensibility on the reader's part.

Each new living thing in the world each day says: You are alone, and not getting younger.<br><br>At the age of thirty-seven, the journalist and novelist Jesse Green found his life dramatically changing when he met and fell in love with a man who had recently adopted a baby boy. Having long since made peace with his choice not to be a parent, Green now faced the shock and the responsibility of a fatherhood he had never imagined. The Velveteen Father is his candid, heartfelt, and often hilarious account of the formation and flourishing of a family.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In intimate, graceful prose, Green describes his partner's journey from the hedonistic eighties to the realization that he wanted to have a child; his own concurrent journey to find a way to become an adult without having a child; and their journey together to become good parents in a society whose reactions to unconventional families can be both funny and frightening.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In the classic bedtime story, a velveteen rabbit is made real at last by a child's true love. <i>The Velveteen FatherM</i> is a moving record of the transformative effect parenthood can have on people who least expect to become parents, of how we are repeatedly made anew by the love of children who need us. But this transformation is not just the province of parents, Green writes; only by addressing, in some way, the generations that come before and after us can we face the task of becoming real.

0-292-77088-X,Mary Shelley: A Literary Life (Literary Lives),"Williams, John",Palgrave Macmillan,218,2000-03-31,"Art, History",Hardcover,"<p>Beginning in Paris in the 1920s, women poets, essayists, painters, and artists in other media have actively collaborated in defining and refining surrealism's basic project-achieving a higher, open, and dynamic consciousness, from which no aspect of the real or the imaginary is rejected. Indeed, few artistic or social movements can boast as many women forebears, founders, and participants-perhaps only feminism itself. Yet outside the movement, women's contributions to surrealism have been largely ignored or simply unknown.<br> This anthology, the first of its kind in any language, displays the range and significance of women's contributions to surrealism. Letting surrealist women speak for themselves, Penelope Rosemont has assembled nearly three hundred texts by ninety-six women from twenty-eight countries. She opens the book with a succinct summary of surrealism's basic aims and principles, followed by a discussion of the place of gender in the movement's origins. She then organizes the book into historical periods ranging from the 1920s to the present, with introductions that describe trends in the movement during each period. Rosemont also prefaces each surrealist's work with a brief biographical statement.<br></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Though surrealism has often been viewed as a male-dominated movement, women (many more than the few well-known artists such as Lenora Carrington and Frida Kahlo) have been integral to its development. In this first anthology of writings by women Surrealists, drawn from an impressively global group, Rosemont (Beware of the Ice and Other Poems, Black Swan, 1992) dives deeper than the extant writing on the movement to unearth the women involved since its inception. These varied writings--automatic texts, prose pieces, critical tracts, Surrealist inquiries (e.g., Would You Open the Door?), and results of Surrealist games (e.g., Time-Traveler's Potlatch)--offer a history of women's formative participation in surrealism's past and create a context for its future. Rosemont's insightful introduction, short essays prefacing each major period of the movement, and brief bibliographies illuminate a vibrant revolution in process. An important research tool as well as a fascinating read, this major contribution to art history and literary scholarship is highly recommended for academic and public libraries.--Rebecca Miller, Library Journal</p>",en,2000,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.89 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches",45,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/81/9780292770881.jpg,Success

Monette also wrote four books of poetry, including <i>Love Alone: Eighteen Elegies for Rog</i>, as well as several screen-to-page novelizations, including Predator and Scarface. 
<p>The body of writing Monette is best known for, however, is his trio of biographical works, <i>Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir</i>, <i>Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story</i>, and <i>Last Watch of the Night: Essays Too Personal and Otherwise</i>. The second of those books, <i>Becoming a Man</i>, won Monette a National Book Award and in turn nearly unprecedented gay-to-straight crossover readership and acclaim. And rightly so. <i>Becoming a Man</i> is the most moving and well-written memoir published in the last decade. It stands alone as the standard by which all other gay-themed nonfiction is judged.</p>
<p><i>The Gold Diggers</i> is clearly among Monette's early works, lacking his later polish and clarity. Perceptive readers will nevertheless recognize flashes of Monette's growing brilliance-his ability to turn a phrase, to conceal and expose characters, to spin plots, to entertain. Ensconced within this early literary brilliance is the story of lovers Peter and Nick, Peter's longtime friend Rita, Nick's hustler/lover Sam, and the pursuit of a priceless cache of stolen artwork hidden in Peter and Nick's mansion, Crook House. The tale is timeless and engaging with a wonderful, happy ending. It is for these reasons that I am pleased to include Paul Monette's <i>The Gold Diggers</i> in the Alyson Classics Library.

A small child when Castro comes to power in 1959, Flor grows up amid the chaotic events of the Revolution and the irrevocable changes it brings to her family and hometown of Cabaiguan - from the possession and ruin of her grandparents' farm to her parents' bitter disillusionment with the new government. After requesting to leave the country, her family is taunted as ""gusanos"" and ten-year-old Flor is sent away - along with thousands of other schoolchildren - to a rural work camp where she picks tobacco and sugar cane for several years. Despite the hardships, Flor gains wisdom and comfort from the older women in her family: her two grandmothers, Petra and Patricia, and her Afro-Cuban nanny, Carmen, each of whom teaches her about the power of spirits and magical ways to seek healing. When her family leaves Cuba in 1970, Flor leaves behind forever her grandmothers and Carmen, as well as her beloved homeland. Uprooted and living in exile, she learns to draw on the spiritual lessons she has been taught by the women in her family to find her place in the new world.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/10/9781580050210.jpg,Success

0-226-72180-9,Gay Lives: Homosexual Autobiography from John Addington Symonds to Paul Monette,"Robinson, Paul",University of Chicago Press,456,1999-03-01,,Hardcover,"<p>In his autobiography, John Addington Symonds relates a glorious night of passion, in which he and his lover ""lay covered from the cold in bed, tasting the honey of softly spoken words and the blossoms of lips pressed on lips."" Christopher Isherwood's first autobiography, on the other hand, was far less direct; he wrote a second autobiography in part because the first was ""not truly autobiographical"" in that ""the author conceals important facts about himself."" These contradictions, evasions, and explicit sexual details of the life stories of fourteen men form <i>Gay Lives</i>, a revealing account of homosexual autobiography.</p>
<p>Paul Robinson reads the memoirs of French, British, and American gay authors—André Gide, Quentin Crisp, and Martin Duberman, among others—through the prism of sexual identity, asking fascinating questions about homosexuality and its relation to literary form. How did these authors discover their sexual identity? Did they embrace it or reject it? How did they express often conflicted desires in their words, which ranged from defiant and brutally frank to ambiguous and abstract? Robinson considers the choices each made—as a man and an author—to accommodate himself to society's homophobia or live in protest against his oppression.</p>
<p>Despite the threads that connect these stories, <i>Gay Lives</i> refutes the notion that there is a typical homosexual ""career"" by showing that gay men have led wildly dissimilar lives—from the exuberant to the miserable—and that they have found no less dissimilar meanings in those lives.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.375 Inches, Weight: 2.12525620568 Pounds, Width: 1.6 Inches",41,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/04/9780226721804.jpg,Success

What Newman Reveals, However - As She Focuses On The Working Poor In Harlem, One Of The Country's Most Depressed Urban Areas - Is A Community Of People Who Are Committed To Earning A Living, Struggling To Support Themselves And Their Families On Minimum-wage Dead-end Jobs, And Clinging To The Dignity Of A Regular Paycheck, No Matter How Meager.

Alison",The University of North Carolina Press,288,1999-05-31,,Paperback,"<p><br>An illuminating study of vaudeville, this book shows how women&#151;as performers, patrons, and workers&#151;influenced its rise and fall as America's favorite form of live entertainment.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>These two volumes examine the historical impact of women in the entertainment industry, offering perceptive comments about American culture in the process. Sochen (history, Northeastern Illinois Univ.) divides performers into various groups: black women vaudevillians, bawdy women entertainers, the entertainer as reformer, child stars, and women comics, to name a few. She examines a potpourri of stars within these contexts, including the details of their careers, the obstacles they encountered, their personal histories, their impact on the public, and their relevance to the eras in which they performed. Many were symbolic of Eve (the seductress), Mary (sweet and innocent), or Lillith (the career woman), while others violated these conventional female boundaries. Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Ethel Waters, Mae West, Eva Tanguay, Shirley Temple, Dinah Shore, and Roseanne Barr are among those discussed. Popular entertainment collections should find this work useful. Rank Ladies, on the other hand, focuses more exclusively on women in vaudeville, discussing their history, specialties, difficulties, and triumphs as well as their place in society in the early part of this century. Women performers gradually introduced more complex elements to the vaudeville stage--e.g., classical music, satire, theatrical adaptations, and inventive material--that challenged previous standards. Curiously, this produced a mix that was at once successful, provocative, and threatening, changing the composition of audiences, the philosophies of theater managers, the texture of the vaudeville art form, and the nature of the entertainers' work environment. Kibler (Ctr. for Women's Studies, Australian National Univ.) has done an impressive job not only of researching her subject but also of fluidly weaving it into a valuable and entertaining narrative from which she draws perceptive insights and conclusions on the culture of the time that are relevant in any age. For scholarly audiences and those interested in early 20th century American culture.--Carol J.

Bray describes with remarkable frankness growing up poor in Chicago in the 1960s, and her childhood shaped by welfare, the Roman Catholic Church, and the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Bray writes poignantly of her lasting dread of the cold and the dark that characterized her years of poverty; of her mother's extraordinary strength and resourcefulness; and of the system that miraculously enabled her mother to scrape together enough to keep the children fed and clothed. Bray's parents, held together by their ambitions for their children and painfully divided by their poverty, punctuate young Rosemary's nights with their violent fights and define her days with their struggles.</p>

<p class=""null1"">The Awakening: Pre- and Post-Stonewall Riots (1967-1975)</p>
<p>By the early 1970s the political establishment was beginning to take notice of the fledgling movement. In the August 16, 1972, issue, Rob Cole reported on the attempt by a spokesman for Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern to distance the liberal senator from one of the first unequivocally pro-gay statements from a national candidate. ""I hope for the day when we do not need to specify that 'Liberty and Justice for All' includes blacks, Chicanos, American Indians, women, homosexuals, or any other group,"" McGovern said. ""ALL means ALL.""</p>
<p>Despite such progress, gay life sometimes resembled a war zone. In the August 1, 1973, edition, the newspaper reported that an arson fire at the Up Stairs, a popular New Orleans gay bar, had killed 32 men. A photo depicted the charred body of a man frozen in place trying to escape the fire through a window. (The arson remains unsolved.) The same issue carried a photo of the Rev. Ray Broshears, a Metropolitan Community Church minister in San Francisco, brandishing a shotgun after announcing the formation of the ""Lavender Patrol"" to combat ""teenage attacks on homosexuals.""</p>
<p>The newspaper was not without reports of victories, some of them historic. The January 16, 1974, edition reported, in ""Sick No More,"" that the American Psychiatric Association's board of trustees had voted 13-0 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Psychiatrists had studied the lives of gays and lesbians and found no evidence of pathology. The decision had far-reaching ramifications, effectively placing the scientific establishment on the side of gays andlesbians. Critics, however, noted that the change came only after years of lobbying from gay activists, and they refused to countenance the science underlying the vote.</p>
<p>As the feminist saying went, the personal was political. Four years earlier, the July 21, 1970, issue had carried a report on a medical-journal article by gay rights foe Charles Socarides asserting that homosexuality is a mental illness. Socarides, the article said, believed that homosexuality ""derive[s] from a 'faulty sexual identity' caused by a 'pathological family const</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 1.6314207388 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/54/9781555834654.jpg,Success

Using personal anecdotes as well as the stories of other gay and lesbian Republicans, Rich Tafel succeeds in humanizing the struggle he and others have undertaken in their efforts to have their party deal fairly with gays and gay issues, as well as their campaign to make gays aware of the benefits that can accrue from having political alliances with others besides traditional left-leaning Democrats. The book is laid out in three sections: ""Life,"" ""Liberty,"" and ""The Pursuit of Happiness."" In the part entitled ""Life,"" Tafel shows that gay political ideologies are a product of the rejection gays experience. The next section, ""Liberty,"" shows how those ideologies play themselves out in the course of day-to-day American politics, and Tafel warns of the dangers gays face in being taken for granted by the Democratic Party while being written off by the Republicans. In ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" Tafel argues that political strategies alone aren't enough to advance the cause of gay rights - spiritual values and morals, he says, must be at the heart of the gay strategy. Here he challenges both those within the gay community who reject moral language and spirituality and those in organized religion - particularly those in his own Christian faith - who view sexuality simply as a matter of choice, and a choice to be condemned if it is not the straight and narrow.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/42/9780684837642.jpg,Success

An increased emphasis on heterosexual interactions and a growing stigmatization of close same-sex relationships fostered new friendship styles and patterns.</p><p>Drawing on a wide range of primary sources including diaries, journals, correspondence, and popular periodicals, Rosenzweig uncovers the complex and intricate links between social and cultural developments and women's personal experiences of friendship.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.01573 Inches, Length: 5.98424 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.6874002 Inches",75,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/61/9780814774861.jpg,Success

Dilworth's fully realized landscapes range from Pittsburgh to Hawaii to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to Europe. They are inhabited by women, men, friends, lovers, neighbors, parents, and children, all of whom remind us that life is rarely what we think it should be.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Although Dilworth's collection is somewhat uneven, many of the stories speak with considerable power about characters who confront disappointment, loneliness, and their own limitations. The majority of these stories are about young men and women who drift rather aimlessly in and out of sadly superficial relationships. Moving Miami, for example, is a disturbing and subtly wrought story about a character named Marybeth, remarkably disengaged and unreflective about her life, who falls helplessly in and out of relationships with men. We're in Meadville is another unsettling and quietly accomplished story about a small group of friends who find themselves baffled by their romantic relationships. In the best stories, Dilworth explores with insight and sympathy her characters' unsuccessful efforts to come to some understanding of their vulnerability, their loneliness, and the suffering they have brought into their lives.

0-375-70064-1,The Collected Poems of Amy Clampitt,"Clampitt, Amy",Knopf,496,1999-04-20,,Paperback,"<p>When Amy Clampitt's first book of poems, <b>The Kingfisher,</b> was published in January 1983, the response was jubilant. The poet was sixty-three years old, and there had been no debut like hers in recent memory. ""A dance of language,"" said May Swenson. ""A genius for places,"" wrote J. D. McClatchy, and the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> said, ""With the publication of her brilliant first book, Clampitt immediately merits consideration as one of the most distinguished contemporary poets.""</p>
<p>She went on to publish four more collections in the next eleven years, the last one, <b>A Silence Opens,</b> appearing in the year she died.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, the five collections are brought together in a single volume, allowing us to experience anew the distinctiveness of Amy Clampitt's voice: the brilliant language—an appealing mix of formal and everyday expression—that poured out with such passion and was shaped in rhythms and patterns entirely her own.</p>
<p>Amy Clampitt's themes are the very American ones of place and displacement. She, like her pioneer ancestors, moved frequently, but she wrote with lasting and deep feeling about all sorts of landscapes—the prairies of her Iowa childhood, the fog-wrapped coast of Maine, and places she visited in Europe, from the western isles of Scotland to Italy's lush countryside. She lived most of her adult life in New York City, and many of her best-known poems, such as ""Times Square Water Music"" and ""Manhattan Elegy,"" are set there.</p>
<p>She did not hesitate to take on the larger upheavals of the twentieth century—war, Holocaust, exile—and poems like ""The Burning Child"" and ""Sed de Correr"" remind us of the dark nightmare lurking in the interstices of our daily existence.</p>
<p>It is impossible to speak of Amy Clampitt's poetry without mentioning her immense, lifelong love of birds and wildflowers, a love that produced some of her most profound images—like the kingfisher's ""burnished plunge, the color / of felicity afire,"" which came ""glancing like an arrow / through landscapes of untended memory"" to remind her of the uninhabitable sorrow of an affair gone wrong; or the sun underfoot among the sundews, ""so dazzling / . . . that, looking, / you start to fall upward.""</p>
<p><b>The Collected Poems</b> offers us a chance to consider freshly the breadth of Amy Clampitt's vision and poetic achievement. It is a volume that her many admirers will treasure and that will provide a magnificent introduction for a new generation of readers.</p>

Introduced as a child to the genius of Balanchine and the lyricism of Tchaikovsky, Walter has always aspired to be a dancer. As he grows older, it becomes clear that despite his desire, he lacks the talent, and he faces the painful knowledge that his more gifted friends have already surpassed him.<P>Soon, however, that pain is overshadowed when his older brother, Daniel, finds a strange lump on his neck and Walter realizes that a happy family can change overnight. The year that follows transforms the McClouds, as they try to hold together in the face of the fearful consequences of Daniel's illness, and Walter makes discoveries about himself and his friendships that will change him forever.<P>Decades later, after Walter has left home and returned, he must come to terms with the memories of that year, and grapple once and for all with the challenge of carving out a place for himself in this all-too-familiar world.<P>A moving story of the torments of sexuality and the redemptive power of family and friendship, <b>The Short History of a Prince</b> confirms Jane Hamilton's place as a preeminent novelist of our time.</p><h3>Boston Globe</h3><p>Hamilton's third novel and arguably her best, for it matches its range of emotion with a technical precision both masterful and haunting.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/86/9780385479486.jpg,Success

Standing by her husband, President Bill Clinton, as she and the nation learned the truth behind the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the First Lady assumed two roles—dutiful spouse and passionate defense attorney—which she had played on numerous occasions during the course of their tumultuous yet politically unified relationship.</p>
<p>Now esteemed biographer and journalist Joyce Milton examines this formidable, fascinating woman, giving probing insight into the First Lady's character, her values and her career. In <b>The First Partner,</b> Milton goes behind the scenes at the Clinton White House and explores the First Lady's involvement in Travelgate, Filegate, the Health Care Task Force fiasco and fund-raising for the 1996 presidential campaign, showing how these controversies grew out of the tensions in her political partnership with Bill Clinton. Milton also describes how Mrs. Clinton's defensive reactions to her husband's chronic infidelities have often misfired and have sometimes enabled his bad behavior. She examines the differing psychologies of the President and First Lady, yet shows that when faced with political accusations, they take a similar approach of telling only as much of the truth as is necessary—a reaction that has increasingly gotten them into trouble.</p>
<p>Meticulously reported and researched, <b>The First Partner</b> offers keen new understanding of this complex woman who has infuriated and confounded as many people as she has inspired.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/18/9780688155018.jpg,Success

The letters chart their meeting; May's affair with Juliette's husband, Julian (brother of Aldous Huxley), before the war; her intense involvement with Juliette after the war; and the ardent and life-enhancing friendship that endured between them until Juliette's death. While May's intimate relationship with Julian had not been a secret, her more powerful emotions for Juliette had. May's fiery passion was a seductive yet sometimes destructive force. Her feelings for and demands on Juliette were often overwhelming to them both. Indeed, Juliette refused all contact with May for nearly twenty-five years, the consequence of May's impulsive threat to tell Julian of their intimacy. The silence was devastating to May, but her love for Juliette never diminished.

They're outsiders, artists and actors, the scholarship kids who have side jobs and study far into the night. Whenever they excel, it's for the pleasure of it. Rich and poor, immigrant and entitled, these young men and women jump off the page, from Sally's raucous pre-season spaghetti dinner through the heart-stopping end of the season. Each week, Pont takes us to a new meet, with the girls and boys running separate races. As we watch the season unfold, the girls begin to find a new stride, and by the end, they're running on air. Up the hills and around the curves of every practice and race, Sally Pont is there, running along with them, encouraging, understanding, and comforting them. She loves the team, and we do, too. We also come to love the writer, not only for her gifts, but for her great heart. The long-distance race is a mythic archetype, cutting to the heart of who we are. This book, in which young women emerge as stars under the tutelage of a caring coach, adds new dimension to that myth.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/71/9780151003471.jpg,Success

Three men stand as candidates, each the chief of a major Kiowa band. When the nephew of one candidate is accused of killing the nephew of another, the nation finds itself divided; no matter how the council rules in the matter, one band is sure to declare war on the other. With only five days remaining before the ruling council issues their judgment, Tay-bodal, a healer, decides to learn the truth about the murder. Certain that the accused is not guilty, Tay-bodal must find compelling evidence proving the guilt of the actual murderer. If he succeeds, then war will be averted.

The Supreme Court Has Articulated Numerous Interests Promoted By Marriage, All Of Which Apply To Same-sex As Well As Opposite-sex Couples. According To Strasser, The Argument Made Most Frequently To Deny Recognition To Same-sex Unions - That Marriage Exists To Provide A Setting For The Production And Raising Of Children - Is In Fact A Reason To Acknowledge Such Unions. The Claim That Marriage Is For Children Biologically Related To Both Parents Is Refuted In The Case Law, Which Treats Biological And Adopted Children As Legally Indistinguishable. Strasser Explains Baehr V. Lewin, The Precedent-setting Case In Hawaii, And Addresses The Implications Of State-by-state Decisions To Ban Or Recognize Same-sex Unions. He Analyzes What It Would Mean To Say That A Policy Violates The Equal Protection Or Due Process Clauses Of The Constitution, And Compares Biased Policies That Target Gays And Lesbians With Those That Victimize Racial Minorities. Strasser Argues That The Defense Of Marriage Act (doma) Is Both Unconstitutional And A Public Policy Disaster. Arguably, It Does Not Give States Additional Rights With Respect To Which Marriages They Need Not Recognize, But Only With Respect To Which Divorces They Need Not Recognize. For Example, Doma Seems To Allow An Individual To Avoid A Court-imposed Duty To Support An Ex-spouse Simply By Changing His Or Her Domicile. Moreover, Strasser Argues, Doma Is An Open Invitation For States To Demand Exceptions That Will Wreak Havoc In Domestic Relations Law. In A Reasoned Response To Conservative Arguments About Marriage, Legally Wed Explicates Established And Evolving Legal Principles, And Shows How Invidiously These Have Been Applied To The Issues Of Gay Rights In General And Same-sex Unions In Particular.

Fiona resists her powerful sexual attraction for Joanna, knowing where it will lead, while Joanna becomes obsessed with that attraction, initially blind to its ramifications.
<p>Joanna Kingston, a succesful real estate consultant, believes that the notion of deep and lasting romantic love is an illusion that inevitably leads people to heartbreak. She has always avoided emotional entanglements by keeping her affairs short and sweet, and by choosing lovers whose feelings for her don't rise much above their navels. But her cynicism provides no protection when, by chance, she meets the cool, stunningly beautiful, compassionate and emotionally strong, Dr. Fiona Maddison.</p>
<p>Fiona's instant attraction to Joanna worries her. Joanna's raw beauty, athletic body and chic nonchalance, are hard to resist. ""But she knew all about those sexy charmers with drop-dead smiles who liked to keep on the move, and she was finished with that kind of woman. A friendship with Joanna would be ideal, and that was all."" Joanna, wanting a no-strings affair, hotly pursues her, but Fiona, knowing she would fall for Joanna hard, does her best to keep her distance. Recent romantic problems have made her cautious.</p>
<p>Joanna, already weakened by recurring dreams about her troubled distant past, finds her feelings tumbling into unfamiliar territory--both frightening and wonderful--that she finds hard to deal with. The story takes the reader on a journey into Joanna's past, and into her heart. There are some surprising twists and turns along the way, as the truth about the past changes things radically for Joanna. Cracks begin to appear in her emotional brick wall as she learns that things are not quite what they seemed to be. Set in Melbourne, the hot, dry landscape of the northern Victorian bushland, and the tropics of Far North Queensland, the story is intensely passionate with some poignant and heart rending scenes. There are also many moments of humor and good fun. I enjoyed writing this book, and I hope my readers will enjoy it, too.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/49/9781562802349.jpg,Success

Four years later, by the time they graduated, they found a world turned upside down by the Pill, Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, Roe v.

For the thirtieth anniversary of the Class of '69 - ""Hillary's class"" - Horn has created trenchant, remarkably nuanced portraits of these women, chronicling their experiments with sex, work, family, politics, and spirituality. Horn follows them as they joined SDS, tumbled into free-love communities, prosecuted pot growers, ministered to Micronesian natives, fled trust-fund security, forged and surrendered marriages, plumbed the challenges of motherhood, and coped with the uncertainties of growing older.

<p>• One of the first accounts of the mysterious sangomas, the healers of South Africa's black population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A mystical journey that will appeal to those wishing to reunite with their roots and a more spiritual life.</p>
<p>Set against the stirring backdrop of a crumbling apartheid regime, <i>African Spirits Speak</i> is the lyrical account of white South African Nicky Arden's journey into the world of the <i>sangomas</i>, the diviners, doctors, psychologists, and priests of South Africa's black population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in her early twenties Nicky fled South Africa with her husband as the stranglehold of apartheid tightened on her native land. For twenty-two years they lived in California as expatriates—never once returning to their homeland—until a deep depression, followed by a spiritual awakening in the California desert, compelled Nicky to return to South Africa. During her visit, while exploring deep in the bush, she unexpectedly met an old black medicine woman—a sangoma. This meeting would change her life. Few white South Africans are even aware of the world of the sangomas, but this prophetic old woman saw in Nicky the spirit of a fellow healer and set the author on a mystical journey that would reunite her soul with its African roots. Thus began her astonishing and complex initiation into a nearly unknown world and her quest to discover the truth about herself and her heritage.</p>",en,Original ed.,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.00220462262 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",5.19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/28/9780892817528.jpg,Success

<br>
Just like a woman! The very phrase is a put-down, echoing the long-entrenched stereotypes of what it means to be female. From earliest recorded history, women have been cast in terms of males: lesser versions that are frailer, smaller, dimmer, less competent, defective. Never again. This lively, meticulously documented book turns the dismissive old catchphrase inside out.<br>
<br>
It is only in the past few years that researchers in many fields have actively focused on what being female really means. Their startling conclusion: almost every assumption made about women—physical, medical, historical, psychological—turns out to be untested, unproven, or untrue. Rather than classifying women only by their biology (as the medical establishment has), or denying they are biological creatures (as some feminists have), <i>Just Like a Woman</i> presents the cutting-edge findings in anthropology, physiology, psychology, neuroscience, endocrinology, and medicine that are redefining what a woman is.<br>
<br>
These findings reveal the complex interconnections between all aspects of a woman's life from infancy to old age. Gender science is confirming that the female of the species is not the second sex but the separate sex. She is as powerful as the male but with different strengths: intuitiveness, adaptability, durability, sensitivity, sensuality. Her brain is smaller but more densely packed with neurons, her senses of smell and hearing more acute, her core body temperature higher. She processes emotions and perceives pain differently; she sleeps more lightly; she is more vulnerable to certain mental disorders and more resistant toothers; her body reacts differently from a man's to many medications; and the rhythms of her monthly cycles shape not only her fertility but her mood, her creativity, and her resilience. These are only some of the special aspects spelled out in this book, and all of them are crucial to a woman's understanding of her body, her mind, her spirit, and her relationships with those she loves. From conception on, she is female to the core.<br>
<br>
This stereotype-shattering book lays out what it means to live in a woman's body, think with a woman's brain, drink in the world with a woman's senses, and react with a woman's sensibility to the stresses and elations of her multiple roles. Refreshingly free of ideology, <i>Just Like a Woman</i> offers a stunningly liberating message that expands our concept of human potential and will forever change the way every woman views herself.",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.55 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/84/9780553102284.jpg,Success

A pollution-free environment counts for nothing. Even some people - namely women - count for nothing. This is the case, at least, according to the United Nations System of National Accounts. Author Marilyn Waring, former New Zealand M.P., now professor, development consultant, writer, and goat farmer, isolates the gender bias that exists in the current system of calculating national wealth.</p>
<p>As Waring observes, in this accounting system women are considered 'non-producers' and as such they cannot expect to gain from the distribution of benefits that flow from production. Issues like nuclear warfare, environmental conservation, and poverty are likewise excluded from the calculation of value in traditional economic theory. As a result, public policy, determined by these same accounting processes, inevitably overlooks the importance of the environment and half the world's population.</p>
<p>Counting for Nothing, originally published in 1988, is a classic feminist analysis of women's place in the world economy brought up to date in this reprinted edition, including a sizeable new introduction by the author. In her new introduction, the author updates information and examples and revisits the original chapters with appropriate commentary. In an accessible and often humorous manner, Waring offers an explanation of the current economic systems of accounting and thoroughly outlines ways to ensure that the significance of the environment and the labour contributions of women receive the recognition they deserve.</p>",en,2nd,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 6.03 Inches, Weight: 1.1684499886 Pounds, Width: 1.02 Inches",35.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/02/9780802082602.jpg,Success

Although many in the Egyptian upper classes were firmly opposed to change, the Ahmeds were proud supporters of independence. But when the Revolution arrived, the family's opposition to Nasser's policies led to persecutions that would throw their lives into turmoil and set their youngest child on a journey across cultures. Through university in England and teaching jobs in Abu Dhabi and America, Leila Ahmed sought to define herself - and to understand how the world defined her - as a woman, a Muslim, an Egyptian, and an Arab. Her search touched on questions of language and nationalism, on differences between men's and women's ways of knowing, and on vastly different interpretations of Islam. She arrived in the end at an ardent but critical feminism and an insider's understanding of multiculturalism and religious pluralism.

Well, she's back -- and she has a story to tell.</p>
<p><i>Little Sisters</i> explores in depth what it is like to be the youngest, shortest female in a household. These are the women who, as children, had to go to bed first -- when everyone else in the family was up having <i>fun</i>. They learned rebellion early; becoming the ""good girl"" or perhaps a ""wild one,"" whatever the family needed. Many of them endured years of torture from their older siblings whose ""larger and moremature muscles make them eager oppressors."" So says author, journalist, and little sister Carolyn Lieberg, in her playful, informative, and sometimes touching look at the women whose mantra is ""I'll catch up no matter what.""</p>
<p>Interviews with grown-up little sisters yielded stories, insights, and experiences that will ring true with youngest siblings everywhere. Lieberg examines the hotly debated topic of birth order psychology and reveals previously little-known or generally ignored facts about little sisters. They <i>are</i> more popular in school; and studies show that little sisters tend to be radical thinkers and rebellious by nature -- more inclined to create a new system rahter than working to improve it -- something they cheerfully attest to. Drawing from examples in scientific research, personal experience, and literature, <i>Little Sisters</i> eloquently supports (or irreverently disagrees with) a number of theories and truisms. The author finds common characteristics and peculiarities among little sisters but also recognizes their wide-ranging personalities and ambitions.</p>

She describes them in all their forms, with particular attention to the differential treatment given never-married and divorced single parents, and to the impact of gender, race, and class. Emphasizing that all families face significant conflicts between work and family responsibilities - a conflict thrown in sharp relief in single-parent families - Dowd argues many two-parent families in fact function as single-parent care-giving households. The success or failure of families, she contends, has little to do with form. Many of the problems faced by single-parent families mirror problems faced by all families. Illustrating the harmful impact of current laws concerning divorce, welfare, and employment, Dowd makes a powerful case for centering policy around the welfare and equality of all children.

These women defied the military dictatorship by embroidering their sorrow on scraps of cloth and using their needles and thread as one of the boldest means of popular protest and resistance in Latin America. The arpilleras they made - patch-work tapestries with scenes of everyday life and memorials to their disappeared relatives - were smuggled out of Chile and brought to the world the story of their fruitless searches in jails, morgues, government offices, and the tribunals of law for their husbands, brothers, and sons. Marjorie Agosin, herself a native of and exile from Chile, has spent over twenty years interviewing the arpilleristas and following their work. She knows their stories intimately and knows, too, that not one of them has ever found a disappeared relative alive. Still, many of them maintain hope and continue to make their arpilleras. Even though the dictatorship ended in 1989 and democracy returned to Chile, no full account of the detained and disappeared has ever been offered. This book includes a history of the women's movement, testimonies from the women in their own words, and, for the first time, full color plates of their beautiful, moving, and ultimately hopeful arpilleras. Anyone interested in the history of contemporary Latin America will want to read this powerful story.

                        <p>""Arpilleras are burlap-backed tapestries depicting the experiences and emotions of women whose sons and husbands were arrested and never heard from again during the years of military rule. Agosin's narrative traces the arpillera movement from its early days under the promotion and protection of the Catholic Church's Vicarâia de Solidaridad through the early 1990s, when newly reestablished civilian authorities decided not to more forcefully seek justice for victims of human rights abuses. The book includes 45 reproductions (on glossy plates), and the moving testimonies of a number of the arpilleristas themselves""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57.

Snyder provides close readings of the surviving examples of Sappho's poetry, occasionally presenting comparative material from other ancient Greek poets. The original Greek text is included in an appendix.
<p><i>-What emerges in this careful and engaging study is an explication of Sappho's work and its literary environment, which illuminates both Sappho and the ways she has been read, adopted, and co-opted over the centuries. Without polemics, and with scrupulous candor and fidelity to the originals, Snyder allows even those readers who are, as she puts it, 'Greekless' to find their connection with the vitality of the words and the poems, which often exist on the page in only the most fragmentary form. By returning often to the bits of text that contain key words and phrases, Snyder actually succeeds in intimating poems where only hints remain.</i> -Choice <i>-Snyder offers a comprehensive treatment of Sappho's poetry for the Greekless reader, including transliterations and translations of the Greek.

Ordinary people plunge into insurmountable personal debt and fall prey to dangerous webs of underground creditors-so dangerous, in fact, that murder may be the only way out. A beautiful young woman vanishes, and the detective quickly finds she is not whom she claims to be. Is she a victim, a killer, or both? In a country that tracks its citizens at every turn, how can two women claim the same identity and then disappear without a trace?<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The horror in this beautifully fashioned tale of stolen identity lies not in the cold-blooded crimes but in the motive-a desperate hunger for consumer goods. Shunsuke Honma, a widowed 43-year-old Tokyo police inspector with a 10-year-old son, is on disability leave. The boring cycle of idleness punctuated by painful physical therapy sessions comes to a halt when a nephew asks for Honma's help in finding his missing fiance, whom he knows as Shoko Sekine. As Honma's search intensifies, he realizes the fiance had actually assumed Sekine's identity and possibly killed her. For the American reader, the jewel in this enormously compelling novel is the portrait of working- and middle-class Japanese getting caught in a cycle of astronomical personal debt in order to enjoy the good life. Also eye-opening is Japan's elaborate registry system for keeping track of its citizenry. In order to become Shoko Sekine, the impostor had to perpetrate an ingeniously elaborate series of hoaxes and lies. Honma is tenacious, methodical, an attentive listener with a retentive memory and the ability to connect disparate bits of information. The trail takes him back through the real Sekine's history and into the life of the other woman, whose family ran afoul of vicious loan sharks. Miyabe drives her complex plot with spare prose, combining expert pacing and psychological nuance to ultimately haunting effect. (Feb.)

Wachtel sheds new light on the psychological foundations of our nation's racial impasse and applies his pathbreaking ""vicious circle"" approach to help resolve it. This timely and fascinating analysis shows how the ways we attempt to cope with racial tensions and inequalities often lead to the perpetuation of our difficulties rather than their resolution. Understanding the ironies that characterize contemporary race relations is the first step toward extricating our nation from the vicious circle.</p>
<p>Both controversial and healing, <b>Race in</b> <b>the Mind of America</b> challenges the orthodoxies that shape black and white opinion and liberal and conservative policies while sensitively exploring the way the world looks to both sides and why it looks that way. Wachtel probes the daily experiences of blacks and whites, shedding new light on how individual experiences and larger social, historical and economic forces continually re-create each other. In illustrating how blacks and whites get caught in vicious circles that sustain the very behaviors and attitudes they wish would change, Wachtel also points toward the concrete solutions to our seemingly enduring dilemmas and shows how to move beyond the adversarial rhetoric that divides us.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.7416518698 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",175,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/01/9780415920001.jpg,Success

In a fast-paced, bawdy, swashbuckling adventure in Central America of the early 1700s, Costa Rican novelist Tatiana Lobo lays bare the dark legacy of the Conquistadores and the Church. Through the central picaresque story of Pedro Albaran, Lobo dramatizes the intrigues of politicians and the Inquisition and the bloody battles between the native people and the invaders, while simultaneously presenting a reverent poetic recreation of indigenous cosmogony and mystical values which the natives seek to use to drive out the invaders.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>On the one hand a hilarious swashbuckling adventure, on the other a bloody, bitter indictment of the Catholic Church in the colonizing of Central America, this novel deservedly won the Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz Prize in 1995. Pedro Albaran, first victim and then instrument of the Inquisition, arrives in Costa Rica in the first decade of the 18th century. In his tender love for a native woman, he embraces her culture without ever understanding it and then must watch his Spanish countrymen wreak havoc on her--and their daughter's--people. The novel is kept moving rapidly by its memorable cast of characters, including a sensuous tavern keeper, a deranged priest, and corrupt politicians.

Cold Shoulder is the story of a young woman who has everything: a devoted husband, two beautiful daughters, and a successful career as a lieutenant with the Pasadena Homicide Squad. But when her partner is shot and dies in her arms, Lorraine's life starts to unravel. The after-hours drinking that once was social becomes her refuge, and soon she's not waiting until the end of her shift. From there it all comes undone with frightening speed: Drunk, she kills an innocent boy while on duty, is fired from the force, is abandoned by her family, and ends up living on the street as a prostitute. Cold Shoulder is the dramatic, frighteningly explicit account of Lorraine Page's fall and nightmarish recovery while caught between the danger of a serial killer on the loose and the manipulations of the old-boy police force that had ostracized her not so long before.

<br>
Making the Gods Work for You presents internationally renowned author Caroline W. Casey's remarkable doctrine of Visionary Activist Astrology. In this reverently irreverent mystery school disguised as a book (in which each of the planetary gods is a professor), we are invited to think of our lives as a spiritual detective novel. For example, Venus teaches us that our affinities and quirks are clues to our unique mission and contribution to the world. The astrological language of the psyche is a tool for deciphering and revitalizing this sense of mission. Casey teaches you how to expand your range of intimacy with the ten parts of yourself represented by the planets, here called gods. You will learn how to use this language to reverence and feed the forces of your psyche that connect you to very real external forces. This book intends to catalyze a movement to engage the imagination of all people with a sense of humor and a desire to do collaborative good in the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding on the ideas first presented in her popular audiotape series, Inner and Outer Space, Casey explores the archetypes at the heart of human relationships, aspirations, and spiritual quests. In an engaging narrative enlivened by stories, fables, exercises, and meditations developed through her work as an astrological counselor, she provides a practical system of personal and collective liberation. Making the Gods Work for You provides us with innovative principles to live by and rituals inviting us to become active, dynamic participants in the dance of life. We can then become increasingly conscious players on theteam of creation, capable of sharing our gifts with the world at this crucial historical time.",en,,"Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.75 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/87/9781564556387.jpg,Success

The book focuses on the follow-up interviews with grown-up children who took part in the study - all of whom were born to heterosexual partnerships but whose mothers later entered lesbian relationships. Shedding light on the quality of their family life, young adults share what it was like to grow up with a lesbian mother and her partner and discuss their level of awareness during childhood of growing up in a lesbian-headed home. Also considered are ways children from lesbian mother families integrate their family background with their school environment and cope with prejudice. The study's painstakingly compiled findings clearly demonstrate that children from lesbian mother families are no more likely than others to experience mental health problems in adulthood, children generally form positive and mutually beneficial bonds with their mothers' female partners, social stigmatization does not prevent children from enjoying good relationships with peers, and children of lesbians are not more likely to identify as homosexual or bisexual themselves. Expanding our notion of what family really means, this volume has important implications for child custody disputes involving a lesbian mother, as well as adoption and foster-parenting policy and issues of access to assisted reproduction procedures, such as donor insemination. It will be welcomed by professionals, educators, and students in psychology, social work, and sociology; others interested in the long-term influences of childhood experiences on adult life; and readers in women's studies and lesbian/gay studies.                        <p>The book contains no figures.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.68784225744 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",24.03,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/23/9781572304123.jpg,Success

She explores whether reparation -- such as the monetary awards given to Japanese-Americans for internment during World War II, or art, such as Holocaust memorials -- can be a basis for reconciliation after immeasurable personal and cultural loss. Minow also writes with informed, searching prose of the extraordinary drama of truth commissions in Argentina, East Germany, and most notably South Africa, and in the process delves into the risks and requirements involved in hearing from victims, the dynamics of gender, and the value of even imperfect gestures in the midst of these riveting experiments in justice and healing.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/60/9780807045060.jpg,Success

At the age of twenty-one Susan J. Miller received a stunning blow: she learned her father was a heroin addict. His love of the music led him to the dark side of the New York jazz scene in the '50s and he brought its shadow home. Susan's frank exploration and discussion of how that affected her family and herself in ways deep and lasting won Never Let Me Down stunning critical praise.

Into this world comes sixteen-year-old Rachel, a young woman who loves the round symmetries of Latin verse and the melancholy beauty of the Somerset countryside. Rachel is drawn into the conflict between two of the school's powerful figures. On one side is the formidable headmistress, who preaches the virtues of self-control while inviting teachers into her room at night. On the other side is Rachel's classmate Margaret, who openly despises Bampfield, urges Rachel to read <i>The Well of Loneliness</i> and sneaks out for trysts with her beautiful friend Rena. Unwittingly, Rachel becomes caught in a tangle of passions she does not fully understand, a pawn in a moral struggle to which all innocence will be lost. <P>Thank-you Feminist Press for making this gem of a story available once again! &#151; Lillian Faderman <P>[Manning] has not only a fine ear for prose but a fine eye for character. &#151;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><P>A very intelligent, sensitive, and compelling book. &#151;Anthony Burgess <P>For course use in&#58; lesbian literature, literature of education, 20th-century British literature, women's literature <P>Rosemary Manning 1911-1988 was the author of six novels, many of them set in her native West Country of England, and two volumes of autobiography. <P>Patricia Juliana Smith teaches English at the University of California, Los Angeles, and is the author of Lesbian Panic&#58; Homoeroticism in Modern British Women's Fiction.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Manning's 1962 novel features a burgeoning love between two young girls at a boarding school.

A young teacher, Annalukshmi, whose splintered family attempts to arrange an appropriate marriage for her, must decide whether the independence she craves will doom her to a life without love and companionship. It is also the story of Balendran who, respectably married, must suppress-or confront-the secret desires for men that threaten to throw his life into chaos.<P>With sensuous atmosphere and vivid prose, this masterfully plotted novel re-creates a world where a beautiful veneer of fragrant gardens and manners hides social, personal, and political issues still relevant today.<br><P><b>About the Author:</b><P>Shyam Selvadurai was born in 1965 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. A graduate of York University in Canada, his first novel, <i>Funny Boy</i>, was awarded the Lambda Literary Award in addition to being named a Notable Book by the American Library Association. He has been published in seven countries. Selvadurai lives in Toronto, Canada.</p><h3>Salon - Akash Kapur</h3><p><P>Much like the upper-class Colombo world it portrays, <i>Cinnamon Gardens</i> is a polished and elegant work. Five years ago Shyam Selvadurai, a Sri Lankan-born writer who has spent the better part of the past two decades in Canada, published his well-received first novel, <i>Funny Boy<i>, a touching story about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality. Now he takes up the theme of high-society morality and hypocrisy in a second book that reads like a turn-of-the-century Sri Lankan novel of manners. <P>The trouble is that -- again, like the world it portrays -- <i>Cinnamon Gardens</i> is a little too polished. It lacks the idiosyncrasies and the unpredictability that would give it life. In aspiring to write a grand social epic, Selvadurai has put all the cultural and historical scaffolding a little too neatly in place. Historical incidents obviously gleaned from archival research feel artificially woven in; quotations from the Triukkural, an ancient work of Tamil philosophy, are copiously (and indiscriminately) cited, not only by several characters but also by the author, at the head of each chapter. <P>There is more than a little exoticization in the use of such elements, and like all exoticization, this case tends to emphasize the general at the expense of the particular. Selvadurai is so eager to tell the big social story that he neglects the human elements. Thus he grafts his characters' lives and relationships onto the age's great concerns; the results read like stereotypes. The Mudaliyar Navaratnam, the patriarch of the family at the center of the book, fights against universal suffrage and stifles his son Balendran's passion; he represents the old generation. Annalukshmi, the headstrong young teacher who rides a bicycle and refuses to marry, is the voice of women's emancipation. Mr. Jayaweera, the teacher from a rural village who fights for the rights of laborers, points up the economic exploitation of the colonial era. His conversations with the urbane and well-educated Annalukshmi -- he intrigues her with his talk of spirit possessions and snakebites in the country's interior -- sound like parodies of interclass interaction. <P>These characters and many more populate a sprawling narrative. They find love and friendship, and they struggle through conflicts with family members, social mores and their own repressed desires. Selvadurai holds his complicated story line together adeptly, but he is less successful at fleshing it out, at giving it emotional and psychological depth. When Balendran meets his long-lost lover, Richard, after 20 years (they had been forced apart when Balendran's father discovered the true nature of their relationship), the reunion is, all too characteristically, linguistically stilted and psychologically shallow. Balendran is ""speechless"" and ""stung by [Richard's] words""; later, he feels ""a terrible emptiness."" ""The sure apprehension of another mind / Is the mark of a God,"" runs another verse from the Triukkural (one that Selvadurai doesn't cite). It's the mark of a good novelist, too. <P>Curiously, as the veneer of respectability and propriety begins to wrinkle near the end of the book, Selvadurai's starched tone acquires a little life. Sentiments become less lachrymose, memories more vivid, and the conclusion, in contrast to the rest of the plot, is a surprise. There are traces in the final pages of the sensitivity and insight that distinguished <i>Funny Boy</i>. The effect is uplifting, but also a little disappointing. Selvadurai obviously has tremendous potential; we'll have to wait at least until his next book to see it fulfilled. </p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.38 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches",31.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/37/9780786864737.jpg,Success

Despite the title's resemblance to a Jerry Springer episode (and to Chotzinoff's previous book on garden-mania, People With Dirty Hands, not reviewed), this is a serious inquiry on why the garden-variety amateur, or a person even less athletic than a weekend warrior, would sweat for sports without promise of money or fame. In fact, most of Chotzinoff's noncelebrity subjects (Ted Nugent is known for his music, not his bow-hunting) actually pay for play, lessons, or special camps. Several of them, like a surfing housewife, have to put up with local infamy. The author, herself attracted to unladylike sports, sets out to discover why middle-aged women (her chief target) take up snowboarding, surfing, hunting, dog sledding, or artistic roller skating&#151;sports better suited for hyperactive boys with goatees who won't face a change-of-life crisis for decades. Denver-based journalist Chotzinoff uncovers some truths about the human condition but always delivers them with humor. Large-bodied amateur athletes are termed Clydesdales, and the mediocre athlete-author concludes her description of an attempt to surf with&#58; I end up on shore, both arms bruised, thrilled to the core. One Bad-at-Gym Girl stuns her classmates and proves something to herself by winning a 10K cross-country race in the Senior Olympics. Some of the few men presented here include septuagenarians who walk (never shop) in indoor malls, and a monk who confesses, All of us who run marathons know it's a masochistic pursuit. Others pursue athleticism for the aesthetics, the challenge, the need to be in control, the fear offrumpiness and desire to keep fit, or, especially for those whose cardiovascular systems take them out to confront Nature, the contact with something larger. All the richer for providing almost as many answers as the author has subjects.<P></p>",en,1,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/63/9780151002863.jpg,Success

Through deep evolutionary history, women and men developed different abilities and brain structures. In The First Sex, Fisher explores how women's innate superiorities are particularly well adapted to today's global society. Fisher shows how the special structure of the female brain enables women to do ""web thinking"" or ""synthesis thinking,"" as compared to men's more linear or ""step"" thinking, and she shows why this difference in female and male brain structure and thinking creates opportunities, and complications, for women in the business world. The evolution of women's sexual, romantic, and family lives is also explored as Fisher traces the origins in prehistory of the differences between the ways men and women love and bond. She discusses new trends in families, maintaining that if there ever was a time when men and women had the opportunity to make fulfilling marriages, that time is now.",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.54984970186 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/96/9780679449096.jpg,Success

Well, the area code, of course. Misadventures?<BR> <P>Just the usual crazy high jinks underemployed Tinseltown wannabes usually get up to. Like making off with fish from Tina Louise's koi pond. Or calling Leeza Gibbons via Airfone to ask who does her headshots. Or harassing Alicia Silverstone with tales of watermelon-loving porn stars. Or auctioning off Andrew Shue's chicken wing and Heather Locklear's lip print for charity. You know. And the wannabes themselves? Well, there's Craig, the aforementioned struggling screenwriter. And Dandy Rio, his best friend and star of her own hit sitcom, That'sJust Dandy. Miles, their superpublicist friend, and Ulysses, a noble but unsuccessful musician from Craig and Dandy's college days. Oh, and a whole slew of love slaves.<BR> <P>Packed with Hollywood life lessons and more B-level celebs than you can shake a casting sheet at, Misadventures in the (213) is a brilliantly witty romp through the L.A. entertainment machine. And just wait till you come out the other end. Because, of course, money, fame, and glamour aren't everything.,br> <P>Dennis Hensley is a writer, journalist, and sometime friend to the stars. For the past year and a half, he has written the Misadventures in the (213) column under the pseudonym Craig Clybourn for Detour magazine, and has contributed articles and profiles to Out and Movieline. He is also a regular celebrity profiler for Detour. He lives in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this comic novel of Hollywood's outer circle, essentially a book-length version of Hensley's (lightly fictionalized?) gossip column for Detour magazine, the in-joke is more than a gesture it's a lifestyle. Celebrity-crazed Craig Clyborne has an edge over the other L.A. schemers and dreamers he hangs around with. His best friend is Dandy Rio, the sexually voracious, hilariously Machiavellian star of a new sitcom. The book's plot, which involves Craig's moving to Hollywood to peddle his script, is just a device from which to hang various sketches, mostly about Dandy scheming, alternately, to bed various stars (for example, Bill Maher, the host of Politically Incorrect) and to redeem her career, which, midway through the book, begins to bomb. Dandy is by far Hensley's most enjoyable creation: Craig's always-a-bridesmaid litany of disastrous dates (with a waiter, with the son of a game show host, with the star of a rock 'n' roll band) soon grows tiring. The novel's considerable gag sense and rapid-fire one-liners will be best appreciated by fanatics of TV trivia; others, especially those outside (213), may start to feel like intruders on an infernal party line.</p>",en,1st Pbk.

And even more mothers believe that their strained relations are irreparable, and that friendship -- or even civility -- with their female offspring is impossible. Family therapist and clinical psychologist Dr. Charney Herst tells us it isn't so. In this important and empowering book, which has been featured on Oprah and Good Morning America and has sparked print coverage on the mother/daughter dynamic in papers like the los Angeles Times and The New York Daily News, Dr. Charney Herst teaches mothers to better understand their daughters and to recognize their strengths and weaknesses.
<p>According to Dr. Herst, there are three kinds of difficult daughters. The Dependent Daughter is the one who won't leave the nest, who continually expects mom to pay for everything, the one who seems incapable of running her own life. The Dissatisfied Daughter is the chronically unhappy one who is independent but treats her mother as a dumping ground for grievances large and small. The Distant Daughter is the most heartbreaking of all, for these women have withdrawn, gradually or dramatically -- and sometimes completely -- from their mothers.</p>
<p>This book helps mothers untangle the web of personal history and intense emotion, and take the lead in repairing this all-important bond.

Keeping bees, she found solace in the natural world. She began to write, challenging herself to tell the absolute truth about her life and the things that she cared about. The result is one of the best-loved books ever written about life on the land, about a woman finding her way in middle age.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>An invasion of spring peepers, a young indigo bunting at song practice, a parade of caterpillarsthese are integral parts of Hubbell's environment. She lives alone on a 100-acre farm in the Ozarks, where she tends 200 beehives and produces honey on a commercial scale. In a series of exquisite vignettes she takes us into her world, and a life attuned to nature. Hubbell's busiest season is late summer, when she harvests the honey. Then she needs help for the backbreaking labor (``a strong young man who is not afraid of being stung''). She tells how she desensitizes her helper to bee stings; there is a vivid description of a day in the beeyard at harvest time. We meet her dogs and cats, her neighbors; travel with her when she sells the honey; share the pleasures of observing wildlife.

Their topic, broadly defined, was the postmodern American West. By the mid-1980s, their combined works made for a bona fide literary groundswell in both critical and commercial terms. However, as Krista Comer notes, despite the attentions of publishers, the media, and millions of readers, literary scholars have rarely addressed this movement or its writers.</p>
<p>Too many critics, Comer argues, still enamored of western images that are both masculine and antimodern, have been slow to reckon with the emergence of a new, far more ""feminine,"" postmodern, multiracial, and urban west. Here, she calls for a redesign of the field of western cultural studies, one that engages issues of gender and race and is more self-conscious about space itself—especially that cherished symbol of western ""authenticity,"" open landscape. Surveying works by Joan Didion, Wanda Coleman, Maxine Hong Kingston, Leslie Marmon Silko, Barbara Kingsolver, Pam Houston, Louise Erdrich, Sandra Cisneros, and Mary Clearman Blew, Comer shows how these and other contemporary women writers have mapped new geographical imaginations upon the cultural and social spaces of today's American West.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.05380961236 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches",5.15,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/35/9780807848135.jpg,Success

She began these diffuse but resonant notebooks some 20 years ago, during an increasingly infuriating search for a house in a white suburb of New York City. As her frustrations and isolation mount, her marriage frays; her dark-skinned husband who is a banker acknowledges to her that he married her in part for her light skin, while Derricotte confesses some revulsion at his looks. Her diaries plumb numerous racially freighted incidents. After she fights off a black attacker, the author thinks she hears him disparage her color. The white students she teaches write cathartic poems about childhood but black ones write about race. A white colleague at an artists' colony treats her with condescension. Yet the author also acknowledges she picks white women as confessors, ""maybe precisely because they didn't have the same agony about race."" Derricotte might have done more to analyze how much of her anguish is personal rather than racial, but her candor is brave. Author tour.

As an antidote to warâs destructiveness, H.D. invokes the mystical Moravian heritage of her mother's family to convey an ideal world peace and salvation that would come through the spiritual power of women--a power that also endowed her with the gift of her own art.<br>Although H.D.âs androgynous signature first associated her with early 20th-century Imagist poetics, <i>The Gift</i> exemplifies her continuing innovations in prose. She uses the child-voice, flashback, and stream-of-consciousness techniques reminiscent of Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, and Dorothy Richardson, but expands the genre of memoir through free-associative meditations on myth and her lengthy essayistic Notes on Moravian history, emphasizing the pioneer missionaries' rapport with Native Americans..<br><i>The Gift</i> is key to intertextual studies of H.D.âs wartime oeuvre and to an understanding of the religious and gender concerns pervading her later work, especially the women-centered poems <i>Trilogy</i> and <i>Helen in Egypt</i>.

0-226-02049-5,Victory Deferred: How AIDS Changed Gay Life in America,"Andriote, John-Manuel",University of Chicago Press,494,1999-06-01,,Hardcover,"<p>There is no question that AIDS has been, and continues to be, one of the most destructive diseases of the century, taking thousands of lives, devastating communities, and exposing prejudice and bigotry. But AIDS has also been a disease of transformation—it has fueled the national gay civil rights movement, altered medical research and federal drug testing, shaken up both federal and local politics, and inspired a vast cultural outpouring. <i>Victory Deferred</i>, the most comprehensive account of the epidemic in more than ten years, is the history of both the destruction and transformation wrought by AIDS.</p>
<p>John-Manuel Andriote chronicles the impact of the disease from the coming-out revelry of the 1970s to the post-AIDS gay community of the 1990s, showing how it has changed both individual lives and national organizations. He tells the truly remarkable story of how a health crisis pushed a disjointed jumble of local activists to become a nationally visible and politically powerful civil rights movement, a full-fledged minority group challenging the authority of some of the nation's most powerful institutions. Based on hundreds of interviews with those at the forefront of the medical, political, and cultural responses to the disease, <i>Victory Deferred</i> artfully blends personal narratives with institutional histories and organizational politics to show how AIDS forced gay men from their closets and ghettos into the hallways of power to lobby and into the streets to protest.</p>
<p>Andriote, who has been at the center of national advocacy and AIDS politics in Washington, is judicious without being uncritical, and his account of the political maturation of the gay community is one of the most stirring civil rights stories of our time.</p>
<p><i>Victory Deferred</i> draws on hundreds of original interviews, including first-hand accounts from: Virginia Apuzzo, Reverend Carl Bean, Marcus Conant, M.D., John D'Emilio, Anthony Fauci, M.D, Fenton Johnson, Larry Kramer, Lawrence D. Mass, M.D., Armistead Maupin, Walt Odets, Torie Osborn, Eric Rofes, Urvashi Vaid, Timothy Westmoreland, and Reggie Williams.</p>
<p>""[<i>Victory Deferred</i>] is a richly textured account of the rise of the AIDS sector, that though detailed and comprehensive, reads quickly. The thematic organization of the book works especially well. The clear chronology of the events reveals how competing models of service delivery, treatment activism and private-public cooperation were subsumed into a national AIDS movement. The book should prove excellent for teaching or recreational reading.""—Jose Gabilondo, <i>Washington Post</i></p>
<p>""[A] fine history of the epidemic. . . . Andriote shines with chapters on less-covered but no less important subjects, including the multibillion-dollar 'AIDS industry' and private fund-raising groups. He brings together in one place many facts and figures heretofore unsynthesized.""—Joe R. Neel, <i>Boston Globe</i></p>
<p>""While many books have explored aspects of the impact of AIDS, <i>Victory Deferred</i> is among the most comprehensive. Andriote's adroit integration of the personal and the historical results is an illustrative, analytical account of the disease and its impact on the gay civil-rights movement. His depiction of the poignant struggles, heroic responses and resultant social and political gains emanating from AIDS is a perceptive document for our time—relevant to all readers, regardless of their sexual orientation.""—John R. Killacky, <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p>

<p><i>Petal Sweat</i> By Susan Kan</p>
<p>Rhonda Nickels never considered herself a poet, but lately she was drawn to the magnetic poetry kit on the refrigerator in the staff room at the women's health clinic where she worked. The lunchroom was a difficult place for her, she being shy and newly hired. Instead of trying to talk with the other nurses, most of whom spoke about their weekend escapades, dating dilemmas, or children, she would stand at the refrigerator, sipping from her milk carton. Rhonda was interested in their conversations, she had to admit, but she didn't know how to participate comfortably.</p>
<p>A recent graduate from a nursing school in a small Midwestern town, Rhonda's move to Boston had been a big change. Her family back home had been opposed to her leaving, but Rhonda felt the pull of the ocean, the salt spray, and the warm dunes calling out to her. Timid as she was, a kernel of adventurousness was burning inside her. At 31 years old, she felt it was now or never.</p>
<p>At the clinic she was efficient and well-versed in the language of the body, but she interacted with the patients as though they had brought their cars in for tune-ups and repairs. She could say the words breast, vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and Pap smear as easily as mountain, elevator, door, subway, and lunch.</p>
<p>Rhonda pulled the tiny magnets around the refrigerator:</p>
<p><b>sit there and I can cook eggs and meat</b></p>
<p>Not very poetic. The next day she made a list of rhyming words:</p>
<p><b>make lake steak bake fake take</b></p>
<p>One day, about a month into her new city life, as she searched for words, she noticed on the side of the refrigerator facing away from the room a line of wordsall by themselves:</p>
<p><b>we am love by doing</b></p>
<p>Rhonda looked sheepishly around the room to see if anyone saw her. The others were absorbed in the latest <i>People</i> magazine, the one with <i>The First Wives Club</i> actresses on the cover. Turning back to the five simple words, Rhonda thought, <i>Bad grammar</i>. Then after thinking a moment, she wondered, <i>We am love by doing what?</i></p>
<p>Obviously, as a nurse, she knew. She knew what the books said. But as much as she hated to confess this, she had never been in love, and she had</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.6834330122 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/02/9781555835002.jpg,Success

She was going to observe ""the enemy"" close up, on its own turf. But Minkowitz, a feminist, lesbian, and ""sex radical"" who has won awards for her coverage of gay issues, found something else entirely - a guide to some of the stormiest contradictions within her own soul.<br>
<br>
Sex and love, good and evil, rapture and safety - the religious right, it turns out, is as obsessed with these matters as Minkowitz is. During her adventures with the Christian right, Minkowitz finds all-women Pentecostal services that are as sexually supercharged as her own experiences having group sex with strangers in a lesbian backroom bar. The Promise Keepers, trying to be good in an age when ""good"" men are branded as sissies, alternately move Minkowitz to tears and provoke her mirth when she disguises herself as a teenage boy to join one of their all-male gatherings. On this rollicking trip to hell and back, Minkowitz reexamines staples of gay life she once revered - like Sex Panic!, a group that wants to applaud all that is ""evil"" and ""transgressive"" in sex. She wonders why she ever embraced the idealist assumption that gays are inherently freer, sexier, and ""better"" than straights. And the more she visits the Christian right, the more she discovers that neither she nor they have been getting what they're looking for. In the end, Minkowitz discovers a very different kind of ecstasy. It is not the ecstasy of overcoming the Other; it is not the frenzied search for safety. It is an embrace of all the dangers and beauties that our deepest selves can offer.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/24/9780684833224.jpg,Success

Probably The Most Widely Read Lesbian Novel Ever Written, The Book Has Been Continuously In Print Since Its First Publication And Remains To This Day An Important Part Of The Literary Landscape.<p> Expertly Deciphered And Edited By Hall Scholar And Biographer Joanne Glasgow, <i>your John</i> Is A Selection Of Hall's Love Letters To Evguenia Souline, A White Russian &#232;migr&#232; With Whom Hall Fell Completely And Passionately In Love In The Summer Of 1934. Written Between This First Meeting And The Onset Of Hall's Last Illness In 1942, These Letters Detail Hall's Growing Obsession, The Pain To Her Life Partner Una Troubridge Of This Betrayal, And The Poignant Hopelessness Of A Happy Resolution For Any Of The Three Women. It Was Ultimately This Relationship, Glasgow Argues, Which Tragically Precipitated The Decline In Hall's Creative Work And Her Health. The Letters Also Provide Important New Information About Her Views On Lesbianism And Take Us Well Beyond The Artistic Limits She Imposed On The Characters In <i>the Well Of Loneliness</i>. They Shed Light On Her Views On Religion, Politics, War, And The Literary And Artistic Scene. Illuminating Both The Nature Of Her Relationships And Her Views On The Current Politics Of The Time, Your John Will Greatly Extend The Range Of Our Knowledge About Radclyffe Hall.<p></p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>many Assumptions Have Been Made About The Degree To Which Radclyffe Hall's Lesbian Classic, The Well Of Loneliness, May Be Autobiographical. Your John Dismisses All Such Notions. This Exhaustive Collection Of Letters Written Between 1934 And 1942 To Evguenia Souline, A White Russian Migr With Whom Hall Fell Deeply In Love Are Detailed, Intimate Records Of Hall's Personal Life And Convictions (only One Of Souline's Letters Survives). As Glasgow Notes In Her Excellent Introduction, The Love Affair Between Hall And Souline Started During Hall's Relationship With Una, Lady Troubridge, Which Lasted From 1915 Until Hall's Death In 1943. Hall Had A Deep Commitment And Sense Of Obligation Toward Lady Troubridge And Never Imagined Living Without Her. But As The Letters Show, The Degree Of Emotional Stress In The Daily Lives Of All Three Women As They Tried To Accommodate The Situation Was Great. Hall Comes Across As At Once Infinitely Romantic And Oddly Practical. She Praised Souline Constantly, Questioned Her Loyalty And Fussed Endlessly Over Her Well-being. However, These Letters Chronicle Much More Than Hall's Obsessive Love For Souline. Hall's Views On Homosexuality Turn Out To Be Far More Advanced Than Any Reading Of The Well Might Suggest. Her Knowledge Of Current Events, Her Devotion To Her Writing And Her Emotional And Fiscal Generosity Toward Souline Combine To Paint A Portrait Of A Devoted, Passionate Writer With An Unquenchable Thirst For Love. There Is Nothing Romantic About This Collection, However, As Hall's Relationship With Souline Seems To Have Been Impossible From The Beginning. If Hall's Neurotic Tone Is Sometimes Grating, The Collection Is Still A Heart-wrenching Record Of How Politics, Money, And Geography Converged To Undermine These Women's Dreams.

0-8018-5976-X,Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: An Introduction,"Bennett, Betty T.",Johns Hopkins University Press,200,1998-11-30,"Women Authors - British - Literary Criticism, Society & Culture in Literature, English Fiction & Prose Literature - 19th Century - Literary Criticism",Paperback,"<p>Recognition of Mary Shelley's systemic dual focus on public <i>and</i> domestic power as the means to interrogate traditional norms and propose alternatives materially alters parochial perceptions of her objectives and her achievements. Her novels, outside of <i>Frankenstein</i>, and recently, <i>The Last Man</i>, have been dismissed as simple, mutual dissociated romances or experiments in genre solely to intersect with a market niche; they are neither. Rather, they and all of Mary Shelley's major works voice a cosmopolitan, socio-political reformist ideology that evolved as their author's acute awareness of world events enabled her to calibrate her literary voice to deal with unfolding rather than past societal issues. Her multidisciplinary fusion of literature, political philosophy, and history calls for a commensurate multidisciplinary reading in order to understand the complexities of both the author and her works. -Betty T. Bennett</p><p>In this book, Betty T. Bennett offers an extensively expanded version of the introduction she wrote for Pickering and Chatto's eight volume set, <i>The Novels and Selected Works of Mary Shelley</i>. Along with her insightful retelling of Mary Shelley's eventful life story, Bennett gives us a fresh reading of <i>Frankenstein</i> in the context of its author's full career. She also discusses a variety of Mary Shelley's lesser known works, including <i>Matilda</i>, <i>Valperga</i>, <i>The Last Man</i>, <i>Perkin Warbeck</i>, <i>Lodore</i>, <i>Falkner</i>, and her travel books. The result is a compelling portrait of Mary Shelley as she saw herself-an inventive, irreverent writer whose desire for political and social reform was at the heart of her literary expression for three decades.</p><p> The Johns Hopkins University Press</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5621787681 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches",3.25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/62/9780801859762.jpg,Success
