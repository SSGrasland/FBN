In the idyllic suburb of Glen Ridge, New Jersey, four of the town's most popular high school athletes were accused of raping a retarded young woman while nine of their teammates watched. Everyone was riveted by the question: What went wrong in this seemingly flawless American town?<br>
In search of the answer, Bernard Lefkowitz takes the reader behind Glen Ridge's manicured facade into the shadowy basement that was the scene of the rape, into the mansions on ""Millionaire's Row,"" into the All-American high school, and finally into the courtroom where justice itself was on trial.<br>
Lefkowitz's sweeping narrative, informed by more than 200 interviews and six years of research, recreates a murky adolescent world that parents didn't—or wouldn't—see: a high school dominated by a band of predatory athletes; a teenage culture where girls were frequently abused and humiliated at sybaritic and destructive parties, and a town that continued to embrace its celebrity athletes—despite the havoc they created—as ""our guys."" But that was not only true of Glen Ridge; Lefkowitz found that the unqualified adulation the athletes received in their town was echoed in communities throughout the nation. Glen Ridge was not an aberration. The clash of cultures and values that divided Glen Ridge, Lefkowitz writes, still divides the country.<br>

<p>""Can you come to a fish fry?"" you asked. Leaving me there in that windowed stairwell where we'd been talking, you rushed away to your next class after the final bell rang. I watched you below dart out of the building and down the sidewalk, stop, turn, look up, and catch me watching you. Then embarrassed from being caught, I waved, casually, friendly, you know -- but instead of going on your way, you dashed right back into the building and called up the stairwell to me. ""Can you come to a fish fry?""</p>
<p>I thought you were joking. ""A fish fry?"" I laughed.</p>
<p>""We're having one at my house."" That house you shared in town with three other women -- Susan, who would end up spending all the money she'd collected for the utility bills before moving in with her married and gray-haired abnormal-psychology professor; Lisa, whose childhood had been nastily scarred by a father's promise to have TV's Annie Oakley at her eighth birthday party (he brought home the actress while she was on a 10-city promotional tour--a grown-up lady in a suit, a lady no one recognized without her trademark pigtails, guns, fringed vest and cowgirl boots, and ten little girls wept bitterly); and finally Margaret, your best friend from high school, who I and most people assumed you were or had been lovers with, since the air around you both was so thick with longing that we could all taste it.</p>
<p>""Bring everybody from Duchess house, if you want,"" you said. Duchess House being that collapsing country farmhouse I lived in with Dick and Diana, a young married couple -- too young and too married--and an assortment of other revolving students. The house was so named because our English teacher, Dick's and mine, said all great literature made use of religion, sex, or the aristocracy, hence the greatest sentence ever written would go something like: ""My God,"" said the duchess to the bishop, ""take your hand off my thigh."" Duchess. House.</p>
<p>We wrote and painted and acted, your household and mine--all of us talented, all of us terrified of that talent, that it wouldn't be enough (as indeed it wouldn't be) or that it might be too much (as it most certainly would).

Like the cougar, increasingly crowded by a rapidly encroaching civilization, he scavenges what precious little remains of the beautiful animal in all of us.</p><p>Cast of 3 women and 2 men.</p>",en,1st Edition,"Height: 8.31 Inches, Length: 5.43 Inches, Weight: 0.37699046802 Pounds, Width: 0.37 Inches",7.69,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/38/9780889223738.jpg,Success,53,22,1

The topics they wrote about were as wide-ranging as their interests and experiences, and their correspondence encompassed many of the varied events of their lives. Laurence's letters - of which far more are extant than Wisman's - reveal much about the impact of her years in Africa, motherhood, her anxieties and insecurities, and her developement as a writer. Wiseman, whose literary success came early in her career, provided a sympathetic ear and constant encouragement to Laurence.</p>
<p>The editors' selection has been directed by an interest in these women as friends and writers. Their experiences in the publishing world offer an engaging perspective on literary apprenticeship, rejection, and success. The letters reveal the important roles both women played in the buoyant cultural nationalism of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>This valuable collection of previously unpublished primary material will be essential to scholars working on Canadian literature and of great interest to the general reading. The introduction contextualizes the correspondence and the annotations to the letters help to clarify the text. The Laurence-Wiseman letters offer a fascinating glimpse into the lives and friendship of two remarkable women whose personal correspondence was written with verve, compassion, and wit.</p>",en,Annotated,"Height: 8.99 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.4550509292 Pounds, Width: 1.28 Inches",33.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/05/9780802080905.jpg,Success,55,22,1

During the Occupation, when she was twenty years old, she drifted into the Polish Underground. By her own admission, she was attracted at first by the adventure, but youthful bravado soon turned into a mental and spiritual mastery over fear. Because Krystyna spoke fluent German she was assigned to collect information on German troop movements at Warsaw airport. In 1942, at the age of twenty-one, she was arrested by the Gestapo and transferred to prison in Berlin where she was executed two years later. In the last eighteen months of her life Krystyna wrote over sixty letters which, through the kindness of a courageous prison guard, were smuggled to her parents or the guard's daughter who became her penpal. From the moment she was arrested, Krystyna would not allow her spirit to be broken and believed that ""the noble that is within us will not perish."" It is Krystyna's humanity that unites her with other victims of war and other resistance fighters, and enables us to identify with her even though her ordeal was outside the scope of our experience.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.70988848364 pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/52/9781550650952.jpg,Success,55,22,1

0-14-025427-7,The Concubine's Children,"Chong, Denise",Penguin Canada,304,1/2/1996,Paperback,"<p>The ethos of family is dramatically portrayed by Denise Chong in this tale of her grandmother, brought from China as a young concubine by a sojourner to the New World, of the man's wife and the children who would be left behind, and of the author's own incredible discovery of those children six decades later. Here is a true story, woven from letters, photographs, and memories, with more twists and turns than any novel. It is a story of the lives of one family living on two different sides of the globe: in a village in South China before and after the Communists took power, and in the gritty Chinatowns on North America's west coast. The ""at-home"" wife would hold sacred the honor of the family; supporting her was the concubine who sacrificed her own family in working the tea houses abroad, in ""Gold Mountain."" In tow was her youngest daughter, the author's mother. It was she who unlocked the past for her daughter, whose curiosity about some old photographs ultimately reunited this family, who had been divided for most of this century.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>This superbly told saga of family loyalties and disaffections reads more like a novel than an actual chronicle of Chan Sam, a Chinese peasant who left his family in 1913 to seek his fortune in the ``Gold Mountain'' of western Canada. There, though always planning to return to them, he set up a second family with the beautiful, headstrong concubine he brought with him from China. The story is narrated in the third person by his granddaughter, a Canadian economist, who creates an unsentimental portrait of both families: of Huangbo, the patient ``home-wife'' who raised their son and the two children the concubine, May-ying, left behind, and survived the Japanese occupation of China and the rule of Mao Tse-tung; of May-ying, whose earnings as a waitress in west coast teahouses often supported the struggling Chan Sam, his family in China and her own two Canadian-born children. And we learn of the fate of all the children, especially May-ying's daughter Hing, the author's mother. Although Chan Sam never fulfilled his dream of returning to his home-family, after his death, Hing and the author made the pilgrimage to China to embrace the relatives they had never known. Photos.

By preserving their clothing traditions, the Inuit celebrate their accomplishments, show pride in being a part of a unique culture, and affirm their lasting connection to the natural and spiritual worlds of their ancestors. Sinews of Survival draws together information about circumpolar clothing technologies, styles, and materials from 4000 years ago to the present. In this unique and beautifully illustrated book, Betty Kobayashi Issenman explores the living legacy of Inuit garment use and manufacture.<p>Sinews of Survival summarizes prehistoric finds related to clothing, describes the materials used, their characteristics, and the different items of clothing which are common throughout the circumpolar world. The tools are described at length as well as ingenious ways in which the Inuit prepared the material they harvested from animals, birds, and sea mammals. The text is accompanied by patterns and illustrations of seams and stitches which serve to highlight differences in style from one region to another and help identify historical clothing of different Inuit groups.</p><p>The author weaves together Inuit voices, drawings, and writings, giving a glimpse of a rich and layered culture which has survived some of the harshest living conditions in the world while abiding in ecological and spiritual harmony with its environment. While the focus is on the Canadian heritage, ample references to and images of Inuit clothing from Northeastern Siberia, Alaska, and Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) help readers appreciate commonalities and differences. Written in accessible languagewith numerous photographs, Sinews of Survival is an important resource for Arctic scholars, anthropologists, and archaeologists, and for the general public it opens a door to Inuit culture.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 2.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",140,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/64/9780774805964.jpg,Success,56,22,1

0-8020-8057-X,The Trouble with Normal: Postwar Youth and the Making of Heterosexuality (Studies in Gender and History),"Adams, Mary Louise","University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division",256,1997,Paperback,"<p>In the years after the Second World War, economic and social factors combined to produce an intense concern over the sexual development and behaviour of young people. In a context where heterosexuality and 'normality' were understood to be synonymous and assumed to be necessary for social and national stability, teenagers were the target of a range of materials and practices meant to turn young people into proper heterosexuals.</p><p>In this study, Mary Louise Adams explores discourses about youth and their place in the production and reproduction of heterosexual norms. She examines debates over juvenile delinquency, indecent literature, and sex education to show not why heterosexuality became a peculiar obsession in English Canada following the Second World War as much as how it came to hold such sway.</p><p>Drawing on feminist theory, cultural studies, and lesbian/gay studies, <b>The Trouble with Normal</b> is the first Canadian study of 'youth' as a sexual and moral category. Adams looks not only at sexual material aimed at teenagers but also at sexual discourses generally, for what they had to say about young people and for the ways in which 'youth,' as a concept, made those discourses work. She argues that postwar insecurities about young people narrowed the sexual possibilities of both young people and adults.</p><p>While much of the recent history of sexuality examines sexuality 'from the margins,' <b>The Trouble with Normal</b> is firmly committed to examining the 'centre,' to unpacking normality itself. As the first book-length study of the history of sexuality in postwar Canada, it will make an important contribution to the growing international literature on sexual regulation.</p>",en,First Soft-Cover Edition,"Height: 8.97 Inches, Length: 5.99 Inches, Weight: 0.9259415004 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",2.48,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/78/9780802080578.jpg,Success,56,22,1
1-55164-108-9,Race Class Women And The State,"Schecter, Tanya",Black Rose Books,204,3/26/1998,Paperback,"During the 1950s, a growing number of women, including married women with children, entered the paid labor force. Many women who had traditionally been employed as domestic servants left their employment for jobs where remuneration was higher, hours of work better defined and protective measures applied. The State then turned to other countries, to women of color from the Third World, notably the Caribbean and the Philippines for domestic workers. This led to a change in immigration policy; the State began to import foreign domestic workers to work for low wages, under adverse conditions, with no labor and mobility rights. North America was seen by these women as an economic opportunity, even if they were forced to work as domestics, the wages were higher than in their country of origin.
<p>Tanya Schecter argues that the State consciously acted to take advantage of these women's desperation, of their poverty, in order to find a cheap supply of domestics for its own citizens while limiting its own social expenditures.</p>
<p>In ""Race, Class, Women and the State"" she traces the role of the State in setting the policies that have allowed North American women to increase their participation in the public sphere, while at the same time keeping the public-private divide and its attendant value structure much the same as they were at the turn of the century: that is, domestic labor and child care remain women's responsibility and are valued less than work performed in the public sphere. It shows how women are overwhelmingly forced to work a double day. Moreover, for many immigrant women of color, their double day increasingly takes place in the home as they are forced to work in other women's homesperforming domestic duties for low wages.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.38360433588 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",24.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/89/9781551641089.jpg,Success,56,22,1

By doing so, she recovers the rich histories of South African women artists and celebrates their creativity in the visual arts. In a series of related essays teeming with fresh insights, Marion Arnold asks new questions about the ways women have portrayed themselves, depicted landscapes, painted images of plants and sculpted the body. She examines, too, portraits of women (both black and white) in service and the long history of representations (usually by men) of the female 'other'. Throughout the book, the connections Marion Arnold makes between ideas, artists and their works are always illuminating and often unexpected. Here are not only familiar names viewed afresh - such as Maggie Laubser, Irma Stern, Helen Sebidi and Jane Alexander - but lesser-known artists who are rediscovered and brought to life.</p>",en,,"Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",26.81,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/64/9780312165864.jpg,Success,63,22,1

The primary importance of this goddess is emphasized by the serpent coiled over the forehead of every pharaoh--the supreme symbol of royal power in ancient Egypt. The erotic vitality and fierce aggression of the goddess, qualities commonly perceived as masculine in nature, gives the reigning Pharaoh the capacity for dynamic leadership. The author explores the symbolism behind this and other manifestations of the goddess in Egyptian cosmology and provides new revelations on the rich tradition of feminine divinity in Egypt. <i>Hathor Rising</i> is the most important study of one of the world's oldest civilizations to appear in years.<p>Alison Roberts, Ph.D., studied ancient Egyptian and Akkadian at the University of Oxford.

June Wayne Exhibition Captures Her Inventive, Influential Spirit: Pure Light And Space Became A Serious Aesthetic Vehicle In '60s Southern California. Such Phenomenon-based Art Flowered Here In The Work Of Chaps Like Larry Bell And Robert Irwin, But They Had Artistic Ancestors. Painter John Mclaughlin Is Frequently Noted. Another Less Obvious Precursor Is June Wayne. At 80, She's Something Of A Phenomenon Herself. Her Work Is Reviewed At The Los Angeles County Museum Of Art In June Wayne: A Retrospective. About Time, Too. Rarely Seen In Her Adopted Hometown, This Cultural Trailblazer Has Achieved More Than This Artistic Accolade. In The '40s, She Fought A City Hall That Thought Modern Art Was A Commie Plot. In 1960, She Founded And Directed The Nonprofit Tamarind Lithography Workshop. It Literally Saved An Endangered Art Form. She Was Wife, Mother And General Family Care-giver While Actively Championing Feminist Aims, Inspiring Such Kindred Younger Spirits As Judy Chicago. Wayne Is Like A Renaissance Figure Reincarnated As A Scrappy Depression-era Chicago School Dropout Fending Off Wise Guys While Reading John Donne. The Exhibition Shows Her No-guff Human Side Best In The Dorothy Series, A Portfolio Of Graphic-nostalgia-style Prints Dedicated To Her Mother. Its Least Typical But Most Mordant Image Is A Pop-literal Picture Of A Brassiere Titled Power Net.

In this challenging series of dialogues with nineteen artists, writers, philosophers and critics, art critic Suzi Gablik addresses these and other central questions about the meaning and future of art in an age of accelerating social change and spiritual uncertainty. In conversations that are by turns intense, personal, philosophical, intimate and poignant, Hilton Kramer and Leo Castelli staunchly defend modernism's traditional isolation of art from political and social issues; sculptors Rachel Dutton and Rob Olds and performance artist Coco Fusco explore new kinds of art-making in an attempt to reconnect with the contemporary world; and Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul and archetypal psychologist James Hillman show how art's present crisis of meaning is tied to the broader context of our contemporary social and spiritual crises. Conversations Before the End of Time combines the incisive analysis of Suzi Gablik's previous criticism with the interactive creativity of the meeting of seminal minds; For anyone seriously concerned about the future of contemporary art and culture, it is both a sourcebook and an inspiration.",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 7.3 Inches, Length: 4.6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/83/9780500278383.jpg,Success,64,22,1

For the child, Sky, will not accept the compromises Larque has made in her life - and, ultimately, leads her older self out into the vast, adult and mysterious night in search of lost dreams. Larque's nocturnal wanderings take her farther from home and hearth than she ever imagined possible - to the neon pinks and Day-Glo yellows of Popular Street, where life is exciting and gay. Here in this secret place, she meets the beautiful, tormented cowboy Shadow - and Argent, the handsome stud-lover Shadow has molded from the pliable clay of middle-aged angst. And it is here, beneath Shadow's talented fingers, that Larque herself is remade - becoming a new ""Lark,"" younger, stronger, more courageous...and male. But freedom is a pricey commodity - and there are those who would gladly clip Larque's newly formed wings. Her loving, gentle, bearlike husband Hoot desperately wants her back - steadfastly refusing to accept his wife as a muscular, teenaged boy. And her disapproving mother is especially dangerous - since she has the power to ""blink"" her errant daughter into some maternally approved, no-warts ideal.

553295276,Beauty: A Novel,"Tepper, Sheri S.",Spectra,480,3/1/1992,Paperback,"<p><P>With the&#160;&#160;critically acclaimed novels <i>The Gate To&#160;&#160;Women's Country, Raising The Stones</i>, and the&#160;&#160;Hugo-nominated <i>Grass</i>, Sheri&#160;&#160;Tepper has established herself as one of the major&#160;&#160;science fiction writers of out Time. In&#160;&#160;<i>Beauty</i>, she broadens her territory even&#160;&#160;further, with a novel that evokes all the richness of&#160;&#160;fairy tale and fable. Drawing on the wellspring&#160;&#160;of tales such as &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot;&#160;&#160;Beauty is a moving novel of love and loss, hope and&#160;&#160;despair, magic and nature. Set against a backdrop&#160;&#160;both enchanted and frightening, the story begins&#160;&#160;with a wicked aunt's curse that will afflict a young&#160;&#160;woman named Beauty on her sixteenth birthday.&#160;&#160;Though Beauty is able to sidestep tragedy, she soon&#160;&#160;finds herself embarked on an adventure of vast&#160;&#160;consequences. For it becomes clear that the&#160;&#160;enchanted places of this fantastic world&#151;a place not&#160;&#160;unlike our own&#151;are in danger and must be saved before&#160;&#160;it is too late.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The latest from the talented Tepper ( The Gate to Women's Country ) is many things: a fantasy of manners, a dystopian science fiction tale, a time-travel story and an eco-morality play. Still more impressive is the evolution of the narrator and title character, whom we follow for a century of life (ages 16 to 116) as she matures gradually and subtly from a pouty, slightly spoiled daughter of a duke to a wise old woman. Retelling various fairy tales, Tepper strips away each story's gloss. Sleeping Beauty's sleep continues endlessly, prince notwithstanding; Cinderella is as heartless and nasty to her ugly stepsisters as they are to her; and Snow White is a blond bimbo, while the dwarfs are a querulous collection of Basque brothers. Tepper manages to maintain interest, style and theme throughout these disparate elements, and she consistently sniffs out the ugly (e.g., the storybook land of Chinanga, which has all the facets of a fairyland but is an extremely boring place to live). Despite an often depressing worldview, this is a beautiful book from one of the genre's best writers.

553576372,Memoirs of Elizabeth Frankenstein,"Roszak, Theodore",Bantam,425,10/1/1996,Mass Market Paperback,"In The Memoirs of Elizabeth Frankenstein, Theodore Roszak offers us a subversive, erotically charged counterpart to Mary Shelley's classic, Frankenstein. It is presented in the form of a secret autobiography, a soul-baring document intended for the eyes of a single reader: Elizabeth's brother, lover, and spiritual other half - Victor Frankenstein. The writings are discovered by Sir Robert Walton, the Arctic explorer who, in Mary Shelley's original novel, recorded Victor's deathbed confession. Walton becomes obsessed with learning the full story behind the mad doctor's last words. From the tattered pages of Elizabeth's journal and the scattered clues Walton finds as he re-creates her life, a compelling tale of moral horror unfolds. In her memoirs, Elizabeth emerges as a spirited woman far ahead of her times. Rescued as a child from the Gipsies by the brilliant Lady Caroline Frankenstein, she is raised as young Victor's adopted sister. Under Lady Caroline's guidance, Elizabeth is initiated into a circle of cunning women - outsiders would call them witches - who are the guardians of long-forgotten pagan ceremonies and healing arts. She and Victor are schooled in ancient teachings that have been transmitted through female adepts who understand the mysteries of nature. The goal is to unite the two in the chemical marriage, a step toward the union of all opposites that will restore the Earth to balance. The two youths pursue their education through the shadowy realms of alchemical lore and tantric sexual rites until a moment of weakness disrupts the quest. Tormented by shame and anger, Victor turns to the unhallowed arts that result in his misbegotten Creature, the vengeful fiend who will haunt Elizabeth's fatal wedding night.                        <p>Rescued from an impoverished life among the Gypsies, raised by a remarkable noblewoman of Geneva, Elzabeth Lavenza was much more than a foster sister to Victor Frankenstein. Together, they forged a sensual bond and entered a world of mythical lore. Theodore Roszak reveals the stunningly passionate story Mary Shelley herself had dared not write.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/75/9780553576375.jpg,Success,72,22,1

Human civilization has evolved into a dual so ciety where walls enclose ...</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Tepper's finest novel to date is set in a post-holocaust feminist dystopia that offers only two political alternatives: a repressive polygamist sect that is slowly self-destructing through inbreeding and the matriarchal dictatorship called Women's Country. Here, in a desperate effort to prevent another world war, the women have segregated most men into closed military garrisons and have taken on themselves every other function of government, industry, agriculture, science and learning. The resulting manifold responsibilities are seen through the life of Stavia, from a dreaming 10-year-old to maturity as doctor, mother and member of the Marthatown Women's Council. As in Tepper's Awakeners series books, the rigid social systems are tempered by the voices of individual experience and, here, by an imaginative reworking of The Trojan Woman that runs through the text.

Such worlds are Middle Earth, Dune—and such a world is Winter.""&nbsp; Twenty-five years and a Hugo and Nebula Award later, these words remain true. In Winter, or Gethen, Ursula K. Le Guin has created a fully realized planet and people. But Gethen society is more than merely a fascinating creation. The concept of a society existing totally without sexual prejudices is even more relevant today than it was in 1969. This special 25th anniversary edition of <b>The Left Hand of Darkness</b> contains not only the complete, unaltered text of the landmark original but also a thought-provoking new afterword and four new appendixes by Ms. Le Guin.</p>
<p>When the human ambassador Genly Ai is sent to Gethen, the planet known as Winter by those outsiders who have experienced its arctic climate, he thinks that his mission will be a standard one of making peace between warring factions. Instead the ambassador finds himself wildly unprepared. For Gethen is inhabited by a society with a rich, ancient culture full of strange beauty and deadly intrigue—a society of people who are both male and female in one, and neither. This lack of fixed gender, and the resulting lack of gender-based discrimination, is the very cornerstone of Gethen life. But Genly is all too human. Unless he can overcome his ingrained prejudices about the significance of ""male"" and ""female,"" he may destroy both his mission and himself.</p>",en,Reissue,Weight: 0.35 Pounds,9.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/25/9780441478125.jpg,Success,72,22,1

140255281,Burning Your Boats: The Collected Short Stories,"Carter, Angela",Penguin Books,480,8/1/1997,Paperback,"<p>from Early Reflections On Jazz And Japan, Through Vigorous Refashionings Of Vampires And Werewolves, To Stunning Snapshots Of Real-life Outcasts And The Glorious But Tainted World Of 'the Rich And Famous,' This Complete Collection Of Angela Carter's Short Stories Gathers Together Four Published Books&#151;fireworks, The Bloody Chamber, Black Venus, American Ghosts And Old World Wonders&#151;with Her Early Work And Uncollected Stories. 'a Strange, Compelling Book... An Undoubted Success.' &#151;<i>the New York Times</i></p><h3>bruce Barcott</h3><p><p>reading This Collection Is Like Wandering Through The Angela Carter Museum. The Tour Begins With Her Early Works From The 1960s And 1970s, Which Display The Rough-edged Elements That The British Writer Would Later Polish Into Masterpieces Of Short Fiction. A Very, Very Great Lady And Her Son At Home, In Which A Pompous Mother Gets Her Comeuppance, Contains Characters Straight Out Of The Brothers Grimm (a Father Of 23 Children Lists Their Names On The Brim Of His Hat) And An Ending Naughty Enough To Satisfy Fans Of Roald Dahl's Adult Tales. A Victorian Fable, Told In An Invented Vernacular, Hints At The Postmodern Narrative Play That Made Carter The Darling Of Associate English Professors. Her Aptly-titled First Collection, Fireworks (1974), Contains Language So Full Of Flash And Dazzle -- At All Hours A Crepuscular Gloaming Prevails Is One Of Her More Subtle Phrases -- That One Cries Out For A Crisp Edit By The Ghost Of Minimalist Raymond Carver. <p>once We Step Into What A Curator Might Call Carter's Mature Period, However, Everything Comes Together. With Her Rich Language, Delicious Sense Of Irony, And Playful Feminist Spirit, Carter Created Fairy Tales For A Postmodern Age. In The Bloody Chamber, She Rewrote The Bluebeard Legend And Gave The Old Boy A Taste Of His Own Blood. In The Werewolf, She Brought A Horrific Twist To The Tale Of Little Red Riding Hood -- And Did It In Two Pages Flat. Her Final Three Collections--the Bloody Chamber And Other Stories (1979), Black Venus (1985), And American Ghosts And Old World Wonders (1993) -- Reveal One Of Our Era's Great Writers At The Height Of Her Powers. While Her Contemporaries Were Turning Out K-mart Realism In Bare-bones Language, Carter Was A Fictional Maximalist Who Bathed In Luxurious Sentences And Wrote About Women Raised By Wolves. <p>in Her Final Years Carter's Best Stories Weren't Quite Stories At All, More Like Exquisite Short Histories. The Fall River Axe Murders, For Instance, Details The Life Of Lizzy Borden Down To The Missing Teeth On Her Comb And Ends Moments Before The Infamous Murders. It's An Amazing Piece Of Writing -- All Prelude, And Yet Completely Satisfying. The Only Regrettable Thing About <i>burning Your Boats</i> Is That Carter's Death In 1992 Means That This Is The Complete Collection. No Matter. I'll Be Reading It Again. -- <i>salon</i></p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 1.08 Inches, Length: 8.12 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 5.34 Inches",17,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/87/9780140255287.jpg,Success,73,22,1
