SUSAN BROWNMILLER,
the celebrated author of Against
Our Will delivers an insightful—
and inciteful—narrative that is
part radical feminist history,
part memoir, and part cultural
commentary. IN OUR TIME
gives new dimension to the women
and events that have shaped
feminism as the millennium draws
to a close, and finally addresses
that most relevant question: What
is the legacy of feminism today?
“When a coming together takes
place, when the vision is clear
and the sisterhood is powerful,
the human landscape is forever
changed.” —From In Our Time

Just in time for the holidays...
Z of A film by Jeanette L. Buck
In her debut film, Out of Season, Jeanette
Buck’s characters remain true to themselves.
Micki Silva (Carol Monda) comes to Cape
May, N.J. to take care of her dying uncle. She
remains the tough, uncompromising professional
photographer who claims she can’t cook and is
uncomfortable caring for a dying man.
The uncle, Charlie (Dennis Fecteau) never
complains about the unfairness of his
approaching death. Instead, he observes the
developing relationship between his niece and
his good friend, local waitress Roberta (Joy
Kelly).
Micki and Roberta are real people, they deal
with everyday life, but they do it with panache. “By far the best lesbian film

This is a beautiful, beautiful book. Many of the photos brought tears to my eyes. To look into the faces of these families is to see

TAMARA DE LEMPICKA
By Laura Claridge
Critics dismissed her gorgeously stylized portraits and condemned her scandalous
lifestyle, but in the 1980's a resurgence of interest in her work was spurred by such
celebrity collectors as Jack Nicholson, Barbra Streisand, and Madonna. The first critical
biography of an extraordinary artist, Tamara De Lempicka is a thoughtful and juicy critical
appraisal of one of this century's most remarkable women.

WOMEN AND DESIRE
By Polly Young-Eisendrath, Ph.D.
In Women and Desire an internationally recognized Jungian analyst and psychologist
helps women reclaim true desire for themselves. Readers will learn to identify the
cause and learn to reclaim self-direction, self-confidence, and self-determination
based on their own real desires. Not since Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex
has female desire been explored so deeply and provocatively.

do dot the sky and sometimes they're pretty ominous,

1) the ability to upload your own database of titles

THE DAWNING
by Karin Kallmaker, writing as Laura Adams
Thirteen years have passed since the fiery explosion that killed seven people and
shattered the lives of thousands more, but Amanda Martin is unable to forgive herself
for her part in the tragedy. Deep in the hills of New Mexico, she watches an
approaching storm, hoping against hope that the torrential rains and violent floods will
wash away some of her pain. In a flash of lightning, she sees something that wasn’t
there just seconds before — a lone woman struggling in the churning waters
hundreds of feet below. After a difficult rescue that almost claims both their lives,
Amanda brings the mud-soaked stranger to the safety of her cabin. But this is no
stranger. For when the mud is washed off, Amanda instantly recognizes the
disheveled woman — as one of the seven who died in that horrible accident!!!

by Marianne K. Martin
Born of wealth, but not love, Sage Bristo was rescued by her Native American
grandmother from a childhood of fear and abuse. Raised in the mystical tradition of
her powerful Seneca foremothers, Sage learns to cherish her heritage as a member of
the Clan of the Doe. Although strangers might be fooled by the handsome woman’s air
of extreme confidence, her lover Deanne suspects that Sage’s emotional scars are
hidden rather than healed.
Trying to find out more about Sage’s pain-filled past, Deanne unwittingly undermines
the trust that is the foundation of their relationship. Sage draws deeper into herself —
the only place she feels really safe. And with Sage at her most vulnerable, temptation
appears in the form of an old friend and lover. Unknown to either Sage or Deanne,
much more is at stake than their future together. The path Sage chooses now will
ultimately determine the survival of her clan.

SHATTERED ILLUSIONS
A Maris Middleton Mystery
by Kaye Davis
When three young women are brutally slain at a dog-grooming shop, independent
crime scene specialist Maris Middleton and her lover, F.B.I. agent Lauren O'Conner,
join forces to stop the killing. Unfortunately, the investigation looks hopeless from the
start. The inexperienced local police fail to protect the crime scene, vital evidence has
been contaminated, and early leads amount to nothing. Frustrated and under intense
public scrutiny, Maris and Lauren feel their relationship slowly unraveling. And all the
while, someone is watching ...and waiting.

performer who makes masculinity into his or her act,”

THE CONFIDENT WOMAN
By Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz
Shaevitz has helped scores of women find the power within themselves to rescue
their self assurance. Her research found that many women are in the paradox of
achieving success in their business and personal lives while not having much faith
in themselves. Written for women of all ages and occupations, this book uses
clear, concise prose to give women practical advice they can use now.

To its human visitors, the planet Ganelle — home to a peace-loving humanoid race
adapted to life on land and in water — seems like a dream come true. But their visions
of a perfect world end quickly with the spread of a virulent disease that drives its victims
to madness and horrific death. Forbidden reentry to their home planet and unable to find
a cure on Ganelle, the colonists discover that the key to survival lies elsewhere. Only
the Kel, an outlawed group from a distant colony, know the secret link between humans
and Ganellians. If the humans join forces with the Kel, they can undergo a powerful
transformation that will allow them to live and love in the alien world. But at what cost?

riage by Barrie Jean Borich is an exploration of the Never Known Men), translated by Roz Schwartz,
society within which an intimate lesbian relationship follows prim, proper, conventional Aline Berger as she
takes place. It is also an exploration of language: how
language can define intimacy and the ways that
lovers claim language, making their own meanings.
Borich’s writing is lovely as she speaks about falling
in love, women, and “marriage.” From the book: “I
don’t like wife.’ It’s true, it doesn’t fit her. But who
does the word wife fit? Fishwife. Housewife. I don’t
like it either. But when Linnea calls me her wife all
that falls away. Then it is a word filled with all the
attention she gives me, plump with kisses on the neck
as my thighs part to her hands. We can only use this
word if we steal it. Hidden in our laps it’s better.” A
gorgeous contemplation of language and love. $24.95
