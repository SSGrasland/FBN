Dear Carol:
To misquote a recent ad, ""WHERE'S THE F.B.N.?""
Those of us out in the backroads of America miss the contact with other
store owners we get with FBN. And you do such a great job telling us of
books, etc., we should get in our stores. So, I hope to see a FBN in my
mailbox soon and I then will be content until I see you and everyone in
Wash, DC on May 24. P.S. - I hope things are as good as B. Grier hints!

you can guess, I've been keeping busy. Yes, when I'm not busy with the

Thanks for all the coverage of the dispute. That's probably more

One correction: we did changè our name, but not exactly as you
printed. The store is now A Woman's Place, we dropped A ICI part. When
we formed our CÀ corporation we wanted to use the name *ÄWP,. But in CA that
had already been taken as a corporate name. We don t know by whom, but i

these were mentioned:
Cash flow problems T1
T the need for financial planning
Undercapitalization 1
Partners who can no longer work together
Too high a payroll and/or too many paid workers
Too high inventories and how to rēduce them
These issues -- how to avoid them and how to deal with them -- came up often
throughout our two days together.

meeting, during the ABA itself and it seemed to have gone well.
Charis: Books & More is into its second year of using discount cards. They
publicize it in the store (with signs and by asking customers at point of
sale if they have discount cards). Cards come in two prices: for $12 you
get a card that is worth 10% discount on up to $150 worth of books; for $20
you can spend up to $350. Both cards are good for a year, but when you've
used yours up you can buy another one. hey stop selling discount cards
between September 1 and January 1, but if you lave a card that isn't used up
yet, you can use it during those months.
Room of One's Own has been using discount cards for 5 years. They have a
separate key on their register for discount sales.

Sales do not fall off either before or after the sale - so far they haven't

A Woman's Place has structured a non-profit arm, based on the fact that 30%

Borrowing -- borrowing from banks is mostly a fantasy. Borrowing from women
in the çommunity had been done successfully by several stores (including
Lammas). One store with a local feminist credit union borrowed as
individuals --- regulations, I believe, prevented the store from borrowing
as a business, but the credit union people knew what was going on.
Inventory -- Keep a close eye on it. Stores with huge inventories tend to
find that (one store's figures) 15% of it moves and 85% of it doesn't.

On Integrating the Store into Your Life
Kay, of Charis has been teaching her journal workshop through the store for
several years -- about half the participants are store customers, and books
on het reading list are available at the store. Both she and the store make
money from the workshop.
This led to the general issue: most of us working in feminist bookstores
have or are developing skills that are marketable -- in management,
budgeting, producing events, etc. By identifying these, it sometimes
becomes apparent that they can be used as a resource for the store and the
store can be a resource for us to share our abilities HOL always for free
either!). Sometimes these are things we sell, sometimes they arè things we
do as part of our commitment to our communities.
Community Relations (Rhea of Golden Thread)
This focused (somewhat to my surprise) on relations with the lesbian
community. I got too involved in talking to take detailed notes, but what
got discussed:

PAZ PRESS: Odyssey of a Small Publisher
Juana Maria Paz
PAZ PRESS is a small Third World women's publisher with one title to
date, The La Luz Journal. I am both author and self-publisher. There is
little to compare the book with except Wanderground and Motherlines,
which depict all-woman fantasy tribes of the future. A true story taken
from my own journal entries at the time, La Luz describes lesbian òf color

in women’s land was high and information scarce sọ I decided to stick with
it and took out a few classified ads and sent the manuscript to a few
publishers. The original version was about 60 typed pages copied on one

The printer suggested I rèduce the copy and use 8-1/2 x 11 sheets
folded sideways to make it look more like a real book. I liked the idea and
it was cheaper but n originals lost so much in the reduction that the whole

ran Telewoman's review. I began to realize the importance of book reviews
and started writing some myself, which gave me the skill to go back and edit
my own work. I lad reviews and articles published in many women's periodi-
cals in 1982. In trying to establish myself as a topical writer I was hoping
to promote my work without expensive advertising which I couldn't afford on
my $116.00 per month welfare income - but I was wrong on both counts.
Submitting topical articles to a variety of publications was an enormous
undertaking and quite expensive. In addition, many supportive readers
didn't seem to know I had also written a book.

y 1983 the volume of reading material at my disposal was unmanage-
able. I had review copies of books, multiple contributor's copies of peri-
odicals,s complimentary subscriptions and a variety of literature and infor-
mation that came to Paz Press daily. I started a Prison Reading Project to
pass on valuable resources to those whose access to them was limited. Many
prisons accept books for inmates if sent by a publisher and feminist papers
were B'dT l ikene o tuog hw r iated d ar ebsosoeks wtioth g aentd amboeu t s twaormteend . of colọr prisoners but I
need help with this project. Although most of the stuff I get is free and
the postal rate for books is cheap, on my own I can only keèp a handful of
prisoners in reading material. omen who would like to get involved are
urged to write to the Prison Reading Project for more information.
Paz Press will be moving in late 1984 and I am trying to promote and
distribute as many books as possible before then. Since I don't want to

encourage new writers to get started, and women who've been at it for years
