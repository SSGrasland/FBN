Again and again FBN has been asked to run a
"Bestsellers List". Publishers and writers want the status
and the blurb to put on the back of the reprints ("Seven
months on the Feminist Bestsellers List!"), bookstores want
to know what's selling elsewhere, so as to be sure they
aren't missing an important book, mainstream publishers
want to know what kind of books are selling, and some
readers (like me) just like this kind of trivia. I'm
always predicting this and that as a feminist bestseller
and I'd like to know how accurate I am.
In a few more years, when most of us have computers,
it will be easier to develop a list....but in the meantime,
FBN is reprinting the Best Seller lists from around the
country. Keep those lists and clippings coming!
