Another idea that was kicked around was that someone
(FBN?) should do a set of book blurbs/reviews/puffs that
could be used by individual stores as a mailer or counter
piece to promote new books. Some stores wanted a ready-to-

they added their logo and address. Other stores wanted
real reviews, to put in their store review magazine.
Others wanted something in between with room for their

Frances will continue to work there. Bruce hasn't had much

be a good idea to announce it through FBN. People who are
interested should write to Bruce Hamerslough, The Hobbit

we all talking to each other or is this going on in

each store contributed even $5/month, it could grow into a
useful fund. Unfortunately one that may well be needed.
