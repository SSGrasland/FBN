Frances will continue to work there. Bruce hasn't had much

be a good idea to announce it through FBN. People who are
interested should write to Bruce Hamerslough, The Hobbit

we all talking to each other or is this going on in

each store contributed even $5/month, it could grow into a
useful fund. Unfortunately one that may well be needed.
