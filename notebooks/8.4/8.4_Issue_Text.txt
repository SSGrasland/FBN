Thanks for your good work, News,
Noncye Oisen I have for months listened to Nancy Manahan and
Rosemary Curb say vile and vicious things about and
to Barbara Grier. It is only with Nancy's latest
letter that I have decided to "break my own
silence".
In this letter Nancy accuses Barbara of
distorting figures and then proceeds to distort the
figures hersẹlf so that they come out to her
advantage. :
When Barbara originally set up the Promotional
Tour for Rosemary and Nancy she was able to get many
of the expenses offset by the TV and Radio stations.
Because of this the out of pocket expenses were very
small. Naiad agreed to pay all these other travel
expenses excluding food. Two $1000 advances were
paid to each of them in April and May to help them
defray costs. In early August they sent us receipts
for their travel expenses and on August 25, 985 we
sent checks to them as follows, $1434.17 to Nancy
and $2109.72 to Rosemary. It should be pointed out
that while Naiad Press was footing the bill for
their travel, they were going all over the country
saying terrible things about Barbara on both a
personal and professional level. It should also be
pointed out that Nancy and Rosemary agreed in
writing to stop bad mouthing Barbara and Naiad
Press. It appears they have chosen not to honor that
More Missing Pieces agreement.

it.
We hope the readers of Feminist Bookstore News
will be interested in supporting this venture. We
can fill orders of over 20 sets for $1.95 per set;
6-20 sets for $2.95 per set and individual orders of
1-5 sets for $3.95 per set. We ask for an inclusion
of 10% to cover postage and handling and that orders
under $20.00 be prepaid. All larger orders require a
$20.00 deposit.
