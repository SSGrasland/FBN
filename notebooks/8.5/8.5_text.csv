Dear FBN,
Here's information on the Second International 2nd INTERNATIONAL
Feminist Bookfair in Oslo. You might be on the mailing FEMINIST
list and have already received this information, but I
thought I'd send it along in case you hadn't.
I have just returned from the frozen north, which
actually was very invigorating. I worked on
translation and on my own next murder mystery, which
will be out next fall. It's called Sisters of the Road
by the way. It's about teenage prostitution -- it's a
bit more somber than Murder but still has lots of
jokes.
The trip was just generally wonderful, the best
I've had. Frankfurt (International Bookfair) was quite
amazing -- like Disneyland, only books. Much more
exciting than ABA -- and there turned out to be lots
of people I knew. Of course publishers were very
interested in our translation series and it was easy
to feel in a wheeler-dealer mood (everyone was) but I
think I did find some interesting stuff. Only time and

A FEMINIST VEGETARIAN COOKBOOK tells the story of Angela Murray, a young Mulatto
girl growing up in Philadelphia. She moves to New
York after her parents die and decides to sweep aside
the racism she believes to be the only obstacle to a

as a white woman. She discovers that there are
difficulties for women as well as for blacks, that
the trials and tribulations of love and marriage are
not the best salvation, and eventually finds
fulfillment in her own creativity. $8.95 paper.

is Blanche PC? Does her self-esteem rise because she
