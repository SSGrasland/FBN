1 wonder if you can help us. We are looking

selection of women's artists? It's really
difficult to get hold of much from the States. We
are both originally from England so we know most
of the right places to try over there. Artists Credit: Gabriela (Philippines) CWS: Post Nairobi

rather than the beginning, and then were lecture-

its identity as a women's writing festival.

We didn't. Later in the conference there was a
problem with the Lesbian Day -- A Celebration of
Lesbian Writing which was organized by a
coalition of Norwegian lesbians who assumed that
the day could and would be closed to male
reporters in the interest of the free flow of
information and communication among lesbians. The
organizers seemed unable to conceive of a major
event without male press attendance. A Global Day
program was organized to run concurrently with
Lesbian Day -- leaving a schizophrenic population
of women who then were supposed to decide if they
were globa! or lesbian. The press attended the

absence kept the focus more fully on feminist
published books. Most of the American publishers,

didn't come because of the expense of traveling

were represented by distributors or (in joint

wheeling and dealing was achieved. The British
feminist publishers were all in attendance.
Most of the events at the fair were set up
as speaker/audience events, rather than
discussion and skills sharing events. Even the
trade day programs carried this overtone. A noted
exception were the impromptu meetings organized
by/for lesbian publishers that were held almost
daily and worked through a formidable agenda of
topics and a mountain of food at an impromptu
potluck. This caucus repeatedly discussed the

of The Women's Press/England and Virago and
wondering why nothing of that scale has been
organized here. I left wondering . . . if Donna

to make a movie, how much would someone have to
raise to start a 60 book-a-year feminist pub-

with much delay, it was turned to a discussion of

getting down to nitty-gritty details and problems

Again and again, it's been suggested that
the bookfair be scheduled in conjunction with
another major bookfair (i.e., Frankfurt) so that
publishers can attend both on the same plane

In addition to the detailed process of One for the Gods
importing the 19 "returned titles", The Defend
Gay's The Word Campaign will step up its Parlia-
mentary lobbying for clarification of the law to
bring Customs laws into line with domestic legis-
lation and to increase control over how Customs
law is enforced and to improve training for
officers enforcing the law; to push for review of
the Writ of Assistance which allows Customs to
search premises (both businesses and homes) and
remove articles without a warrant and a review of
the Customs Department's powers to seize articles
and its power to have the Post Office open
private mail. (Stay tuned to these pages for
further developments....)

Official INS questioning of Randall comes to
forty pages of transcript. Very little concerns
how she gave up her US citizenship during her
1960's marriage to a Mexican national; most
concerns her ideas as evident in her books--there
are nearly forty--on women's and Third World
issues. INS officials also disliked her stand in
the world as an independent autonomous woman.
The decision will be appealed to the Board
of Immigration Appeals, from where, if the appeal
fails, the case will go to the Federal ČOUTrts,

Poet-philosopher and lesbian-feminist
pioneer Elsa Gidlow died peacefully June 8, 1986,
in her mountain retreat, "Druid Heights", in the
California redwoods. She is survived by her
sister Thea Gidlow, her cat Burma, and countless
friends, may of whom came to know Elsa through
her poetry volumes, essays, and the film, "Word
Is Oùút!.
Born in Yorkshire, England, in 1895, six-
year old Elsa immigrated with her family to a
French Canadian village near Montreal. Raised in
privatiton, she was mainly self-educated,
allowing her what she called, "the untutored
space to Be." Leaving Montreal art circles for
Manhattan in 1920, Elsa became poetry editor for
Frank Harris' progressive, much censored
Pearson's Magazine. She sailed to San Francisco
in 1926 with her older, aristocratic lover,
Violet Henry-Anderson ("Tommy") with whom she
lived until Tommy died.

OnlyWomen Press
Not much that's new news here, as Onlywomen
routinely keeps FBN up to date on their new
publications. OnlyWomen was formed in 1974 by a
group of radical feminist lesbians to print and
publish work from the women's liberation move-
ment. Originally called the Women's Press, the
name was changed to Onlywomen after another group
registered the name for their own use. As the
Women's press, OnlyWomen published six books of
poetry, the first British Women's Liberation
Movement calendar and a collection of poetry.

Sheba is a collective of 6 paid workers and
two volunteers. Half of the collective are women
of color and half are white women. Sheba started
publishing in 1980, has 32 books in print and 2
on the way. Sheba is publishing 6 books this
year, with a goal of 8 books next year. Eventual-
ly they see doing 10-12 titles annually. Print
runs started at 3-4000 copies per title and now
run 5000-10,000 copies per title. Sheba's focus
is on new writers, working class women, black and
third world women and lesbian work. About half of
their current budget came from grants. (See
recent articles in OOB and The Women's Review for
more information.)
Sheba's newest title The Threshing Floor was
one of the most exciting finds of the Oslo Book
Fair. I'd rave endlessly, except that between the
fair and this writing, American rights were sold
to Firebrand and the Firebrand edition will be
out in April. (Sheba will do Firebrand's Good
Enough to Eat.) So I'Il rave only moderately: The
Threshing Floor is a powerful and moving novella
about a Black woman artist coming to terms with

publishers. All of which has meant that British
mainstream publishers have entered the feminist
market more slowly than have American mainstream
publishers. (Or, without the proven success, they
might never have entered at all?) The wide-scale
distribution seems to have paved the way for
strong heterosexual feminist fiction collections,
and, wonder, if it's also a factor inthe
slower development of British lesbian fiction?

Gerd Brantenberg's What Comes Naturally is a

national feminist book ten years ago when this

dated with its assumption of a heterosexual

books women need in your community. And then
there are the publishers that have distributors
in the US, but the distributors, somehow, don't
have the titles you want. (Will everyone who has
lost hair over Merrimack orders please read
on.... The next paragraphs are dedicated to you.)
#2 A There turn out to be a number of reasons
why you can't get the hot new books from England
from said American distributors. First Sff it
seems that there's a good chance that the English
publisher is trying to sell the rights to a US
publisher and so is holding the book back from
the US market pending a rights sale. (Does having

learned where and how to buy international money
orders (at the post office, for $2 per $200),
decided to tie up some money in proforma orders,
and let go of a few important notions it becomes
easy. 1) The first notion to let go of is time.
Just because the order only took 6 weeks to
arrive last time is no reason to expect in in
less than 12 weeks this time. Sea mail has no
sense of feminist urgency. 2) You will never get
everything Syou/” order. 3) You, can't keep
internationally ordered titles in stock all the
time. Carrying the hot new lesbian novel and the
latest in Black women's fiction from England
means that you are going to be out of these books
at least some of the time and that you will have
some impatient customers. My stock line to
frustrated customers was always "Since we have to
order that book from England and we can't predict
the seamail, our choices are either to be out of
it some of the time, or never Carry Ait sat all."

many feminist British books are sold to American selling books to American bookstores for which
mainstream publishers only to die from lack of they don't have the US rights and they have

availability if the publisher sells off the
American/British rights at the beginning rather
than selling the book abroad via distributors?
Anyone know any graduate students in search of
thesis topics? Perhaps I can just summarize my
opinions by saying that the point of writing and
publishing feminist books is to get the ideas/
information into women's hands. The discussions
about the most effective ways to do that will
have to wait so that this column can be finished,
so that this issue can go to press.)
More reasons why books you want may not be
at the distributor: Because- of the corporate
structure of several of the British feminist
publishers, the decisions about what inter-
national distributors to use are made for the
entire corporation in the interest of the parent
corporation rather than by/for the feminist pub-
lisher, as are a number of other marketing and
promotion decisions. Communications with the

The standard distributor discount for book-
shops in England is 33%. Sometimes you'll get 35%
if the distributor is also the primary represen-
tative for the publisher and/or if you order
direct from the publishers. How British book-
stores stay open on that mark-up is beyond me.
And of course you pay freight. Since British
books are generally priced lower than American
books, and given the current exchange rate you
have room to mark the books up to 40% and to
recover you postage expenses.

and asked, the answer was "Pipeline". Pipeline
delivers books daily (yes, you read that
correctly, daily!) to bookstores in Central

comes to work, puts together an order based on
yesterday's sales, calls it into Pipeline by
noon, and the Pipeline delivery van pulls up in
front of the shop before closing with the books.
No delivery charge. Can you imagine!?" It boggles
my mind.
So I went to visit Pipeline. Also one of the
highlights of a booksellers tour of London.
Pipeline is a maze of rooms stacked with the

Though this book has already been mentioned
in FBN, I thought it worthwhile to review it
because it belongs in every child's library, and
certainly in every children's section in feminist
bookstores. The only criticism I have is that it
doesn't cross the heterosexist barriers as it has
done the sexist, racist and perfectly-abled
barriers. Minor flaw. It is a more-than-adequate
re-vision.

The Love of Good Women is set in WW II,
