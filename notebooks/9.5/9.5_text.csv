Beatrice Culleton
""April NORTH DAKOTA QUARTERLEY: ‘IN SEARCH OF APRIL RAINTREE brings meaning and
understanding to domains of human experience rarely explicated except in too-familiar social

this simply told story of two Metis sisters forced by circumstances to live apart from their

Spring releases are the subject of this
particular column. Next time I hope to be
reviewing some of these new books. So, on to the
pick of the publishers' spring mystery lists:
APRIL
This. month.. The Crossing.. Press is
inaugurating its WomanSleuth series with the
first paperback publication of Valerie Miner's
Murder in the English Department ($7.95). I like
Miner's work and expect her admirable blend of
realistic characters with feminist and class
issues to be present in this story about Nan
Weaver, an assistant professor and the prime
suspect in a murder investigation. Irene Zahava,
who is editing this series, asks that I remind
you that she is still interested in seeing
sample chapters or outlines of novels, as well
as short stories for an upcoming anthology. They
must have female sleuths, of course, and be
written by women. Write to her at 307 W. State
St., Ithaca, NY 14850.
Other paperbacks due this month are The MAY

(Berkeley, $2.95), a fictionalized biography of great to see our own
Agatha Christie's sleuth. I haven't read this,
but it seems an amusing idea and got good
reviews, so would probably be of interest to
Christie's fans. The Fourth Wall by Barbara Paul
(Bantam, $3.50) also looks promising. It's set
on Broadway, with the cast and crew of Abigail
Jones' play ""Foxfire"" banding together to trap
whoever is responsible for vicious attacks on
the troupe. Sue Grafton, finally in paperback (Bantam,

À stunning new transla-

rhymes and rhythms of the original. Ideal for
classes in English literature and a major con-

Chaucer's LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN
places this little-known poem within a classi-

strates — rather surprisingly — modern feminist
relevance. ""—Jane Chance
