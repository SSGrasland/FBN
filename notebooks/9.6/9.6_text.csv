""No, she's not. She's straight."" Sylvia laughed. ""Linda, just because I'm a
lesbian doesn't mean everyone I know is. Most the women in NEWS are
straight, you know. At least 90 percent. Though, yeah, anyone who wants to

women. All ages, religions, class backgrounds—and 'sexual orientations.""
She gave Linda a serious, teasing look.

Author B. L. Holmes says, ""Married, with four teen-aged children, and
approaching my twentieth wedding anniversary, I was vaguely discontented,

""Then suddenly I fell in love—with another woman.

Library Journal in its March 1, 1987 issue calls Fear or Freedom an
""important new approach to self-defense for women. Smith incorporates much
recent re-search that challenges old ideas about sexual assault. She points out,
for instance, that acquaintance rape is by far the most prevalent kind; it
survival & operates under different assumptions than stranger rape, and should be the
easiest type of assault to combat. However, women are too often prevented
from resisting strongly (although many do resist successfully) because of
conditioning that makes them feel responsible for men's behavior in social
situations. Smith demonstrates how female socialization works to women's
disadvantage and how assertive behaviors that communicate higher status and
self-esteem can discourage assault. . . Highly recommended.""

beautiful books. One is called National Museum

Both are finely done, profusely illus-

A woman commentator in Newsweek complained
that the inaugural exhibit (Tufts') offered no
surprises. What kind of surprises does she
want? What it offered me was a chance to see in
one place art that I'd seen only in reproduction
and some with which I was totally unfamiliar.
For the first time I could look closely at the
Klumpke portrait of Rosa Bonheur which is usu-
ally hidden in storage at the Metropolitan Mu-
seum, NYC and at the somber and awesome ""Reneta

a personal favorite for which I felt a special enthusiasm.
James A. Cox, Editor-in-Chief, The Midwest Book Review
As it stands, the novel is a skillfully written and structured piece of fiction with the power
to make those of us who haven't, look into the mouth of the AIDS beast and cry out in terror.
...… A Cry in the Desert should be mandatory reading for anyone who thinks we are liberated,
gay or straight. Lee Lynch, Author, Home In Your Hands
Pay attention to this one. A Cry in the Desert is a first novel, published and promoted by a
young small press whose owners are willing to take risks. ..….a risk I support wholeheartedly,
and it’s up to all of us, readers with open minds and clear thought, to validate it ...lask
you to read it, give it to people, tell people about it.
Meg Umans, Reviewer/Owner, Humanspace Books, Inc., Phoenix
An unforgettable and harrowing account of the horrors resulting from the health crisis. The
best novel to date about AIDS and the gay community.

Circle of Love
AWOMEN’S UNITY RITUAL
This book is the story of a ritual two older women created to celebrate their love for
each other and the universe. The ritual weaves together New Age/Christian/taoist/
Buddhist wisdom and expressions in a natural, easy way—involving 50 of their
family and friends in a serious, intimate and joyous 1⁄2 hour ceremony.
The complete ritual is contained in this book, but its drama is embellished by
additional information on the diverse guest list— socialist sitting next to ultra con-
servative, fundamentalist Christian next to agnostic, lesbian next to straight, rich
next to poor.
Chapters three and four contain comments from many of the guests who
reported gaining new insights and/or having opening or freeing experiences in
response to the ritual.
“I highly recommend this book for any couple seeking to write their own ritual
regardless of their sexual orientation. These women bring to life the beauty of
deep love, friendship, intimacy and spiritual connection through ritual with
family and friends. I also see this book as a significant stepping stone to
broadening understanding of what it means to be lesbian/gay in our society.”
