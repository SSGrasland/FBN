Incorporating a diverse range of contributors, from poets (Anne Sexton) to polemicists (Shulamith Firestone), Schneir's selection is lively, inspiring and inclusive--there are excerpts from legal documents , such as the ERA and Justice Blackmun's majority opinion in Roe v. . Wade , and from political statements from activist groups. Schneir's introductions, providing historical context and relevant biographical data, take pains to be diplomatic but also acknowledge disputes. Of antipornography crusader and censorship advocate Andrea Dworkin she writes, ``Her blunt, hard-hitting prose is anything but temperate or judicious.'' There is no sex-positive voice like Susie Bright or Betty Dodson to counterbalance Dworkin, but in anthologizing a heterogeneous movement, omissions are perhaps inevitable. Schneir has assembled not just a political sampler but an anthology of some of this country's best essayists. Her sequel to Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings will undoubtedly find a home on women's studies syllabuses, but it deserves a much broader readership.

The Rowan's next generation of passionate and talented descendants prepare to defend their worlds against an alien attack of mysterious origin.<P>Damia had deflected a previous attack on the human worlds and sent the aliens into deep space. Hungry for more living space, they return with plans to dominate, armed with knowledge of the psychic defense they can expect from humanity.<P>However, as it has been learned that Talent can be both bred and taught, the combined abilities of Damia's children make them an even greater power than Damia or her mother. Each child has a special Talent that together makes them the most powerful Gwyn-Raven force yet to come. United they will confront the attackers face to face.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Here McCaffrey introduces another generation in her saga of a family of powerful psionic Talents ( The Rowan and Damia ) raised to serve the Nine Star League. The eight children of Damia and Afra Raven-Lyon approach the threshold of maturity on Iota Aurogae, where they have been raised with young Mrdinis, the only other intelligent life that humankind has encountered--save for the pernicious Hive Culture, which has sought to destroy all other species in its drive to expand through the universe. The eldest teenager, Laria, is sent to the homeworld of the Mrdinis to improve relations between the two species. Thian, the oldest boy, encounters residual human prejudice and almost loses his life when he serves as liaison with a mixed human-Mrdini fleet. The other children contribute their own Talents and insight during stressful periods of human-nonhuman interaction. Certain to be a success with McCaffrey's fans, this initial entry in a promising series offers winning, carefully developed young characters, an attractive alien society and an enemy drawn with more than a touch of mystery and ambiguity.

Now lauded as the Simone de Beauvoir of Russia, Mamonova has interviewed 17 Russian women on the subject of the C.A.S. as it relates to glasnost. Women from all walks of life are asked about changes with respect to their roles and expectations as women. Artists, professionals, dissidents, lesbians, doctors, writers, and civil servants tell their stories in candid terms showing that there is still a long road ahead.

So exclaims Agatha Mallowan, better known as Agatha Christie, to her neighbor Bette Davis at the discovery of the corpse of famous archaeologist (and notorious egoist) Virgil Wynn. Bette has rented Virgil's museum-like mansion in London for a few months of relaxation while her Hollywood lawyers renegotiate her contract, but instead of peace and quiet, she gets embroiled in murder. Bette stumbles headlong into the bitter - and now deadly - Wynn family feud, complete with a cast of characters only George Baxt could create. Mabel, the domineering mother, still interferes although she's been dead for years, as her husband, Sir Roland, knows only too well: Perhaps he has taken Virgil's success as an archaeologist and as Mabel's favorite too personally. Virgil's siblings, Anthea, an unbalanced spinster who writes truly blank verse, and Oscar, who has dedicated himself to cacophonous musical compositions that will never see publication, have begrudged Virgil everything from his lion's share of their mother's attention to his wealth, which was their sole support. Where are Bette and Agatha to turn for the solution to a mystery already too close to home? Toss into the mix an overly devoted maid, a beguiling medium whose seances are to die for, a curse from the tomb of an Egyptian queen, a flirtatious police inspector, and a pinel of arsenic - not to mention a host of dead bodies both new and mummified. Only the grand dame of mystery and the sultry starlet of the silver screen could solve the case!",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/94/9780312109394.jpg,Success,84,17.1

As a busy advertising executive and single gay man living in a conservative Southern town, Michael doesn't exactly have parenthood on his things-to-do list. So when Michael discovers he's been named guardian of his infant nephew, Scott, he finds he's taken on the most challenging job of his life. But he's determined to do it his way, with wit, resourcefulness, and spontaneity. The moral outrage that his new position provokes galvanizes him to fight for custody of Scott, battling a closed-minded, conservative senator - who happens to be the child's grandfather - and a host of would-be moral arbiters in a courtroom showdown. And when fate throws some more surprises his way, he faces getting famous, getting rich, getting his heart broken, and getting all the knots out of old, family ties with the same originality. In the novel's second half, Scott takes up the story of his unorthodox upbringing by his iconoclastic uncle and their adventures discovering life together. In a warm and assured voice, Scott celebrates the many different forms a family can take and the triumph of individualism over straightlaced conformity. Hilarious, cheering, and wise, Say Uncle is bursting with life and love.

                        <p>A gay, thirtysomething advertising executive, suddenly finds himself guardian of his infant nephew--possibly the most challenging job of his life--and is soon embroiled in a custody battle with the child's grandfather, a closed-minded, conservative senator.

In the intervening sixteen years much has changed—the Cold War is over, nuclear arms production has decreased, and there has been a marked growth in environmental awareness. But the nuclear genie has not been forced back into the bottle. The disaster at Chernobyl and the ""incidents"" at other plants around the world have disproven the image of ""safe"" nuclear power. Nuclear waste dumping has further poisoned our environment, and developing nuclear technology in the Third World poses still further risks.</p>
<p>In this completely revised, updated, and expanded edition, Dr. Caldicott defines for the 1990s the dangers of this madness—including the insidious influence of the nuclear power industry and the American government's complicity in medical ""experiments"" using nuclear material—and calls on us to accept the moral challenge to fight against it, both for our own sake and for that of future generations.</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6724098991 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",20.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/15/9780393310115.jpg,Success,127,17.1

Beginning where she left off in her award-winning book <i>The Female Body and the Law</i>, Eisenstein takes the reader on a feminist-inspired road trip, traveling from the thicket of recent abortion decisions to the revolutions of 1989 to the murky chambers of the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings. Along the way, she enunciates a wholly original conception of individual privacy and sexual rights.<br>Eisenstein brings a range of topics to her discussion: the L.A. riots, crack babies, Murphy Brown, political correctness, the 1992 presidential election, the Gulf War. She seeks to redirect our thinking about democracy away from universal conceptions that mask racial and gender oppression to the specific realities of women and people of color. A respect for multiple differences--as represented in the needs of women of color and their bodies--is, she says, essential to inclusive universal rights. Reproductive freedoms and sexual equality, not abstract notions of civil liberties, provide the wellsprings of a meaningful democratic life. Using this perspective to evaluate the Eastern European revolutions of 1989, Eisenstein finds that the separation between their ideals and the reality of the market system illustrates the failings of democratic theory, especially for women.<br>Eisenstein's controversial arguments will provoke a rethinking of what race and gender mean today.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.94 Inches, Length: 5.99 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches",28.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/23/9780520084223.jpg,Success,115,17.1

Families are divided, careers are ruined, lives are lost - all in the struggle between beliefs founded in tradition and those based on personal freedom. Spearheading the fight against the increasingly vocal homosexual community are the leaders of the so-called ""religious right,"" men and women who denounce gays and lesbians from their pulpits and encourage their followers to enact laws against them. Perhaps no one is better qualified to write about these issues and the conflicts they engender than Mel White. He was born into a conservative Christian home and educated in conservative Christian schools and churches. He met his wife there, and together they raised their children to believe in God and to follow a Christian lifestyle. He worked within the church as a filmmaker and writer, and eventually became a ghostwriter of books, autobiographies, and speeches for such noted figures in the religious right as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Billy Graham. But all that time Mel White had a secret. He was gay. In this remarkable book, Mel White looks at his own life in the church and details the struggles he went through to deny and overcome his own natural sexual desires. And in ways sure to anger many of the people he used to know best, he provides a firsthand look at the teachings and workings of the religious right today, showing how they use their power first to politicize their followers and then, using these politics, to spearhead fund-raising efforts. Most specifically, he examines the methods they use to create a campaign of hate and fear against homosexuals. It is a deeply personal story of torment and triumph, as well as a frightening examination of the anti-homosexual tactics of the religious right and a prophetic look at where they might lead our nation.

Now Mel Watkins has written the first comprehensive history of black American humor - from the public face of minstrelsy and vaudeville to the ""real side"" of the slave enclaves and urban street corners, from folklore to prime time. On the Real Side is a thoroughly documented account of a rich comic tradition that grew out of slavery and remained underground for a century, before entering the mainstream in the 1970s. On the Real Side documents the stereotype of Negro humor established by nineteenth-century white minstrel performers who invariably portrayed blacks as irresponsible clowns or fools. Watkins traces the evolution of that distorted image in motion pictures and on stage, radio, and television - in the nation-wide craze created by the Amos 'n' Andy radio show, in Hollywood's representation of domestic servants (as portrayed by comic actors such as Hattie McDaniel, Willie Best, and Stepin Fetchit), and in the controversy surrounding the 1950s television version of Amos 'n' Andy. At the same time, Watkins chronicles the authentic underground humor that had originated in African-American communities and, although virtually unnoticed by mainstream society, was nurtured by word of mouth, passed on through folktales (from animal stories to trickster tales and urban tales such as ""Stackolee""), and captured on race records and in all-black cabarets, films, and theaters. After generations of stereotypes and neglect, this hidden tradition finally emerged before general audiences with Richard Pryor in the 1970s. On the Real Side tells how pioneering humorists and comedians gradually altered the distorted stereotypes and revealed the impious undercurrents of black American humor and its critical appraisal of mainstream values.

In Forgiving the Unforgivable, author Beverly Flanigan, a leading authority on forgiveness, defines such unforgivable injuries, explains their poisonous effects, and then guides readers out of the paralyzing anger and resentment. As a Fellow of the Kellogg Foundation, Flanigan conducted a pioneering study of forgiveness, and from that study, from her clinical practice, and from her many years of teaching, researching, and conducting professional workshops and seminars, she devised a unique six-stage program, presented here. Filled with inspiring real-life examples, Forgiving the Unforgivable is both a practical and a comforting guide to recovery and healing.</p>

She shows that injustice against women begins in the ways that social discourses and practices place women's embodied existence as improper and secondary to men. She intervenes into debates about sexual difference, ethics, philosophies of the body and theories of self in order to develop a new ethics which places sexual difference at the very center of meaning.
<p>Diprose analyzes attempts in both feminist and non-feminist ethics to recognize the role of sexual difference. She critiques biomedical discourses whose descriptions mask a constitution and regulation of ""the body."" Drawing on insights from continental philosophy and feminist theory, <b><i>The Bodies</i></b> <b><i>of Women</i></b> includes critical readings of Hegel, Nietzsche, Merleau-Ponty, Derrida and Foucault as well as productive engagement with contemporary feminist scholars such as Irigaray, Cornell and Young.

Since 1967 - two years before the Stonewall Riots, usually seen as the beginning of gay liberation - The Advocate has been the nations publication of record for the gay community. From its humble beginnings as a newsletter covering Southern California's homosexual subculture to its prominence today as a newsmagazine read around the world, The Advocate has mirrored the astonishing growth of the community it's served. Now the remarkable history of the modern gay and lesbian movement - a quarter century of rebellion and reform, tragedy and triumph - fills the hundreds of pages of news, photographs, essays, cartoons, and interviews culled from The Advocate. From first-person accounts of the Stonewall Riots to the tragic last day of Harvey Milk's life, from the crisis of AIDS to the controversy over outing, the milestones of the movement are presented as they happened, along with accounts of the lighter side of gay life, from disco divas to the politics of drag. Each year is introduced by a distinguished gay or lesbian historian or movement leader. Martin Duberman, Lillian Faderman, Allan Berube, Felice Picano, Urvashi Vaid, Joan Nestle, John Preston, Torie Osborn, and Randy Shilts are among those interpreting this revolutionary movement that has affected millions of people across the world.                        <p>This authoritative history of the struggle for gay rights, as seen throughout the pages of the Advocate, America's leading gay publication, covers 25 years of rebellion and reform, tragedy and triumph--all in a lavishly illustrated, oversized edition.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 9.5 Inches, Weight: 3.95 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/69/9780312095369.jpg,Success,86,17.1

0-8032-9229-5,Mass Rape: The War Against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina,,University of Nebraska Press,234.0,1994-04-01,,Paperback,"Alexandra Stiglmayer interviewed survivors of the continuing war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to reveal, to a seemingly deaf world, the horrors of the ongoing war in the former Yugoslavia. The women—primarily of Muslim but also of Croatian and Serbian origin—have endured the atrocities of rape and the loss of loved ones. Their testimony, published in the 1993 German edition, is bare, direct, and its cumulative effect overwhelming.
<p>The first English edition contains Stiglmayer's updates to her own two essays, one detailing the historical context of the current conflict and the other presenting the core of the book, interviews with some twenty victims of rape as well as interviews with three Serbian perpetrators. Essays investi-gating mass rape and war from ethnopsychological, sociological, cultural, and medical perspectives are included.</p>
<p>New essays by Catharine A. MacKinnon, Rhonda Copelon, and Susan Brownmiller address the crucial issues of recognizing the human rights of women and children. A foreword by Roy Gutman describes war crimes within the context of the UN Tribunal, and an afterword by Cynthia Enloe relates the mass rapes of this war to developments and reactions in the international women's movement.</p>
<p>Accounts of torture, murder, mutilation, abduction, sexual enslavement, and systematic attempts to impregnate—all in the name of ""ethnic cleansing""—make for the grimmest of reading. However brutal and appalling the information conveyed here, this book cannot and should not be ignored.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.87 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches",20.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/91/9780803292291.jpg,Success,115,17.1

Now, a century later, women almost everywhere are the majority of voters but a distinct minority of elected officials. This discrepancy is a puzzle for those who thought democratic institutions would incorporate newly enfranchised women, and a problem for those working to expand democratic representation.
<p>Darcy, Welch, and Clark examine women candidates and candidacies in the United States and several other democratic nations. Their careful analysis reveals that male voters and political elites are not the barriers to women's election that common wisdom suggests. Instead, they find that a party's ability to determine candidate selection, along with election procedures that benefit incumbents, produces slow turnover of elected officials and few opportunities for new women candidates. In addition, the authors analyze nomination procedures and election systems to document both the conditions that lead political parties to nominate more women and the mechanisms that yield more victories by women candidates.</p>

""The phone was tapped from the minute I could talk on it, and the FBI had been at the door since I was tall enough to turn the knob. ... When my teens began it dawned on me: that the only untried, unheard-of, truly original ambition I might pursue was to be normal. Let the Reds take on injustice and get persecuted for their pains. Let the Beats in Greenwich Village reinvent Bohemia. Let the bunch of them get seasick on the waves they made. Me, I'd be conventional!"" Un-American Activities is the story of Sally Belfrage's desperate, and often desperately funny, attempt to be conventional in the fifties - something that seemed to come naturally to most people. Sally had the basic equipment (blond hair, blue eyes), but attending a largely Jewish school, with her father - Cedric Belfrage, editor of the National Guardian - under attack from Joe McCarthy, and with her parents, both English, under constant threat of deportation, she had her work cut out for her. Fortunately she latched on to a trusty guide - downstairs neighbor Debbi-with-an-i Giglio, drum majorette and aspiring airline stewardess, a girl who ""had her kick pleats down pat."" Throughout, Un-American Activities is animated by the tension between Sally's deep love for her father and her Herculean efforts to distance herself from the consequences of his politics. ""Schizophrenia can be kid stuff if you learn it as a kid,"" as she says. This tension - peaking when she gets pinned to a West Point cadet - makes her memoir an enormously affecting father-daughter story as well as a lively portrait of the fifties as seen through teenage blue eyes, from the Bomb to bobby sox, from the Rosenberg case to the poodle skirt.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",22.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/02/9780060190002.jpg,Success,120,17.1

It's being a delivery woman for HomeMade. Because Anna, the feisty heroine of this earthy and irreverent novel, has to put up with things that her male co-workers can't imagine, from a boss who despises women to storekeepers who feel her up when they aren't trying to rip her off for the price of a carton of Chocos. As realized by Susan Jedren, Anna is a true representative of blue-collar, no-glitz New York, a valiant single mother whose attempts to keep her head above water - and her dignity intact - are both hilarious and uplifting. Let 'Em Eat Cake is a novel for anyone who has ever worked at a demeaning job and dreamed of dancing on the merchandise, a book as real as a corner bodega and as refreshing as an open hydrant in the middle of a scorching summer.

                        <p>Anna, a woman of our times, lives in New York City, where she has always lived--as the child of an abusive father, and now, as an abandoned wife and mother of two children. On a lark, she takes a job driving a delivery truck for Feelgood Cakes, each day wending her way through the inferno of New York and facing its sublime insanities with dignity.

Because Jesus was undeniably male and because the Christian church claims him as the unique God-bearer, feminist christology confronts the dual tasks of explaining the significance of a male God-bearer for women and creating a christological model adequate to feminist experience. Jacquelyn Grant rehearses the development and challenges of feminist christology and argues that, because it has reflected the experience of White women predominantly, it fails to speak to the concerns of non-white and non-western women. In response to this failure, Grant proposes a womanist theology and christology that emerge from and are adequate to the reality of contemporary Black women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 5.61 Inches, Length: 8.56 Inches, Weight: 0.78705027534 Pounds, Width: 0.74 Inches",50.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/34/9781555403034.jpg,Success,117,17.1

0-670-84401-2,"Reading from the Heart: Woman, Literature, and the Search for True Love","Juhasz, Suzanne",Viking Adult,304.0,1994-08-01,,Hardcover,"Passionate Readers Know Who They Are And Since They Always Recognize One Another, They Will Immediately Identify Suzanne Juhasz As One Of Their Own. Reading From The Heart Is An Engrossing Exploration Of The Needs And Desires That Lead To A Reading Habit. Part Paean To The Reading Life, Part Autobiography, It Shows That Reading And Real Life Are Not Warring Enterprises But Interrelated Experiences, Each Composed Of Need And Fantasy, Yearning And Satisfaction. As Every Reading Woman Knows, Novels Are Not Escapes From Reality But Spaces Of The Possible, Where They Can Experiment With Other Ways Of Feeling And Being. Interweaving The Story Of Her Journey To Self-discovery With Her Girlhood Infatuation With Little Women, Her Adolescent Immersion In Pride And Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, And Her Adult Experiences Reading Gloria Naylor's Mama Day And Isabel Miller's Famous Lesbian Novel Patience And Sarah, Juhasz Convincingly Demonstrates That The Romance Plot Of Finding, Losing, And Regaining True Love Is As Much About Identity As It Is About Love. And She Makes The Provocative Argument That Women's Fantasy Of True Love Is A Version Of Mother Love, In Which The Hero Of A Novel Offers The Unconditional, Maternal Acceptance That Enables The Heroine To Develop An Authentic Self. Like Mary Catherine Bateson's Composing A Life And Carolyn Heilbrun's Writing A Woman's Life, Reading From The Heart Is A Personal Book That Transcends The Purely Personal. It Will Be A Touchstone For Women Who Love To Read And Believe That Reading Can Change Their Lives. Prologue: The Passionate Woman Reader And The Story Of True Love -- 1.

Neutral Russia looks on. The Allies, even with state-of-the-art American and German technology, are losing. Then, among the misty slopes of the Pyrenees near Bagneres-de-Luchon, on a field of buttercups and corpses, a CRAV operated by Sergeant Gordon Means encounters a blue light. The light approaches the vehicle, and Gordon hears, in the back of his head, the monotonous, sleepy tap-tap-tap of sleet against a window. The light follows him like a stray dog. He calls it Rover. These hovering blue lights, are they friend or foe? If they save lives, why do they also sometimes kill, and drink the blood of the dying, every drop? And Linda Parisi, a middle-aged woman who lives with her excitable poodle, Lacy, in Arlington, Virginia, and writes books about UFOs she has never seen - why does General Lauterbach want to speak with her?

                        <p>As the greenhouse effect wreaks havoc with Earth's atmosphere, leading to worldwide starvation, countries fight for land where crops can be grown. Above the battlefields, an alien force materializes with the power to change the tide of the war--but which side are they on?

When still a teenager she had seen her own mother, Bernice, die tragically young - and perhaps unnecessarily - of the disease. The experience had devastated her family and colored and shaped her entire life. Now forty years old, she was in the eighth month of a much-desired and difficult-to-achieve pregnancy when a lump was discovered in her left breast. What followed was an accelerated roller coaster ride through the modern landscape of medical emergency: an artificially induced fifty-hour labor and delivery of a healthy son, Benjamin; two biopsies, with the loss of one surgeon to illness and a frantic search for another intervening; and a mastectomy - all within two and a half weeks. It was a journey bursting with surprises both terrifying and hopeful, encounters with medical personnel and bureaucrats ranging from warmly compassionate to shockingly callous, and moments of fear and despair followed by ones of gratitude and love and transcendent joy. You Don't Have to Be Your Mother movingly recounts Gayle Feldman's experience and remembers that of her mother. The title, taken from a headline glimpsed in a woman's magazine at a particularly dark moment in her passage, reflects both the author's determination to survive and the profound differences that twenty-five years have made in attitudes toward and treatment of breast cancer. Her book is about family and friendship as well, taking in the generation of her grandmother - who also died young of cancer - and the steadfast support of a loving husband and father and sisters, of in-laws in England who also had had their battles with breast cancer, and of friends and doctors and nurses who were there when needed. Her book is certain to take its place as a classic of the burgeoning movem

She traces the often heated debates surrounding the development of women characters and the representation of feminism on prime-time television, shows how the series was reconfigured as a 'woman's program,' and investigates questions of female spectatorship and feminist readings.

HPB, as she is often called, stands forth as a seminal talent of her era. A trailblazer and a visionary, she cofounded The Theosophical Society in New York City in 1875, and more than any other person was responsible for the introduction of Eastern religious and spiritual thinking into the Western world. Her prolific writings opened a new realm of ideas and have influenced poets, writers, philosophers, and scientists up to the present day. All of her books, including the highly influential The Secret Doctrine, although they were first published over a century ago, are still in print and in ever-increasing demand. Sylvia Cranston's book, the first large-scale biography ever of HPB, took fourteen years to research and write. It focuses on the teachings HPB transmitted as well as on her fascinating life, and it presents a record of her worldwide travels, especially in the Orient and in the Americas, and the important factors that shaped her life's work. Invaluable source material originally published in Russia has been translated into English especially for this work. Cranston consulted hundreds of HPB's letters, some newly discovered and others largely overlooked by previous biographers, thus providing a more complete and definitive portrait of this Russian noblewoman than has hitherto been available.

                        <p>The definitive biography of the controversial woman who first brought Eastern philosophy and religion to the Western world. ""A forerunner of contemporary seers, psychics, and revivalists, with a range of appeal that cut across several schools of thought and religious sectarianism. Her life was one of high drama and illusionists alchemy.""--The New York Times.

This novel opens in fall, 1988, as Cora, an anti-war activist, returns to the U.S. from Canada where she has lived for twenty years. A college student in the mid-sixties, Cora becomes politically curious, then joins the anti-war movement. Based on King Lear and written from the point of view of Cordelia, the book weighs definitions of patriotism and loyalty. In her return as in her past, Cora is testing borders between suffering and virtue, idealism and commitment, self and family, and exploring possibilities of change.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Madness, alcoholism, suicide, aging, parental betrayal, politics and Vietnam are all part of Miner's ( All Good Women ) ambitious but flawed story of one young woman's exile and return. In 1968, with her two brothers serving in Vietnam, Cora Casey made a radical departure from her family's conservative, working-class patriotism and became embroiled in an arson that resulted in the death of her co-conspirator. Disowned by her father for her radical politics, fearful of legal retribution and pregnant by one of her lovers, Cora leaves for Canada. But 20 years later, as her father is dying of cancer, she returns home with her daughter--despite fears of being arrested. Through rapid cuts--to Cora's present, to her college years, to a recent, settled past in Canada, and to her troubled childhood--Miner peels back the layers of family secrets that shaped her protagonist. If anything, Miner is too ambitious, stuffing more psychological, moral, emotional and political baggage into the book than her intimate story can handle. Nor does her language make up for it with strain showing in both narrative (``Cora began to lose weight. Even George commented on her lighter way of being.'') and dialogue (``How did you get so knowledgeable about these European groups, Ralph?''). But she does have a feeling for the trappings of an era, surrounding Cora with scratchy Mary Wells records, Salvation Army kitchen utensils and the smell of sour coffee.

The experiences she recounts in her book taught her more about the practice of medicine in America than all her years of schooling. Her deeply disturbing conclusion: Patients all too often occupy the bottom rung of the ladder, with their legs tied to prevent them from climbing. Equal Partners tells the story of the seizure that led to Heymann's hospitalization and chronicles the year and a half that followed during which she was both doctor and patient. As a patient she received treatment that ranged from candid and compassionate to evasive and inhumane. What was supposed to be a brief, simple, and safe operation to remove a lesion in her brain became a ten-hour ordeal with inconclusive results, thus necessitating yet another round of brain surgery. The obstacles she faced along her hard road to recovery only strengthened her determination to regain the active, meaningful life she once knew - as a wife, mother, and physician working in the United States and in developing countries. Heymann's experiences as a patient convinced her to work toward a new, more compassionate spirit of medicine - one in which physicians and patients are equal partners.

In case after case, Sommers shows how these extremists have propped up their arguments with highly questionable but well-funded research, presenting inflammatory and often inaccurate information and stifling any semblance of free and open scrutiny. Trumpeted as orthodoxy, the resulting ""findings"" on everything from rape to domestic abuse to economic bias to the supposed crisis in girls' self-esteem perpetuate a view of women as victims of the ""patriarchy."" Moreover, these arguments and the supposed facts on which they are based have had enormous influence beyond the academy, where they have shaken the foundations of our educational, scientific, and legal institutions and have fostered resentment and alienation in our private lives. Despite its current dominance, Sommers maintains, such a breed of feminism is at odds with the real aspirations and values of most American women and undermines the cause of true equality. Who Stole Feminism? is a call to arms that will enrage or inspire, but cannot be ignored.

As they gather year after year, their stories, their wisdom, their lives, form the pattern from which all of us draw warmth and comfort for ourselves.<br>A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE COMING OUT FALL 1995<br>&#151; with Maya Angelou, Winona Ryder, and Rip Torn</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Imaginative in concept and execution, Otto's remarkable first novel is designed with deliberate analogies to quilt-making; like the scraps of fabric that make up a quilt, a series of neat vignettes cumulatively reveal the lives of eight members of a woman's sewing group in a small California town, in portraits that include their families and neighbors. Moreover, each chapter is followed by a short set of ``Instructions,'' which provide lucid explanations of the histories, designs and techniques of various quilt patterns that reflect and symbolize the conditions of the characters' lives. The instructions also carry a subtext: assemble and stitch a quilt as you would build and sustain a human relationship. The women who form Otto's narrative quilt include two sisters whose love for each other survives sexual betrayal; a fearless teenager who loses her determination to lead a free, unfettered life when she traps herself into marriage; a half-black woman who cannot escape her heritage; a wife who forgives her husband's flagrant affairs. The economically phrased, intricately designed narrative touches on the larger issues of war, prejudice and the economic condition of women.

Because Of This Gap, What Women Say They Want - Equal Pay, Equality In Relationships, And Limitless Opportunity - Is Not What They Have Achieved, And This Cripples Their Present Lives And Their Future Possibilities. Yet No Malevolent Person Or Conspiracy Holds Women Back From The Equality That Is Rightfully, Legally Theirs. No Imprisoning Force Locks Them Into Second-class Citizenship. Women Voluntarily Remain Outside The Establishment's Walls, Unwilling To Open The Gates And Walk In. For At The Same Time That They Insist On Equal Opportunity And Equal Reward, They Vote Against Women Candidates Who Could Bring About These Goals, And Disavow With A Vengeance The Front-line Forces Fighting In Their Name: Feminism And The Women's Movement. In Fact, Only One Out Of Every Four Women Characterizes Herself As Feminist While, Paradoxically, Nine Out Of Ten Agree With Feminism's Goal Of Equality. And Although More Than Half Of All Voters In The United States Are Women, Unlike Other Groups Outside The Power Structure, Women Do Not Use Their Franchise As A Tool For Social Change. The Result: Political Scientists Estimate That Hundreds Of Years Must Pass Before Men And Women Share Power And Responsibility Equally In America. What's Happening Here? What Internal Forces Are Behind The Deep Divide Holding Women Back From What They Want To Achieve? These Are The Questions That Sherrye Henry Probes With The Help Of Eleven Focus Groups, Assembled Specifically For This Book, And A Nation Wide Poll Of Six Hundred Women. In The Deep Divide, Henry Not Only Analyzes What Has Produced This Paralyzing Dilemma But Offers Practical Solutions For Moving Beyond It Toward The Goal Of Equality Of Opportunity Women Want And Deserve.

This silence supports the common belief that Black people have only recently arrived in Canada and that racism is also a fairly recent development. This book sets the record straight.</p><p>The six essays collected here explore three hundred years of Black women in Canada, from the seventeenth century to the immediate post-Second World War period. Sylvia Hamilton documents the experiences of Black women in Nova Scotia, from early slaves and Loyalists to modern immigrants. Adrienne Shadd looks at the gripping realities of the Underground Railroad, focusing on activities on this side of the border. Peggy Bristow examines the lives of Black women in Buxton and Chatham, Ontario, between 1850 and 1865. Afua Cooper describes the career of Mary Bibb, a nineteenth-century Black teacher in Ontario. Dionne Brand, through oral accounts, examines labourers between the wars and their recruitment as factory workers during the Second World War. And, finally, Linda Carty explores relations between Black women and the Canadian state.</p><p>This long overdue history will prove welcome reading for anyone interested in Black history and race relations.

The human side of the civil war in El Salvador and decades of repression come to the fore in this woman's tale of extraordinary courage and ordinary labor.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>While military solutions to social problems take an awful toll in human suffering, the military's gain in wealth and power is apt to make it reluctant to support peace unless funds are cut off. Tiny, overpopulated El Salvador has recently emerged from a savage 13-year civil war that devastated the country. The war, in reality an agrarian movement to rectify the ownership of over half the land by two percent of the people, gave rise to such human rights abuses that thousands were massacred or fled abroad. Protests by women in turn made them aware of their own status as a disadvantaged group. The author herself was transformed from a peasant to an international human rights activist. Those who know Latin America will not be surprised at her story; a similar story is Nidia Diaz's I Was Never Alone: A Prison Diary from El Salvador (Ocean, 1992).

Yet remarkably, the full story of the Stonewall riots has never been told. Now historian Duberman profiles six early activists, whose lives intersected during the turbulent event that was to become the defining moment of the burgeoning liberation movement.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>A police raid on the Stonewall, an unlicensed Greenwich Village gay bar, set off a series of riots in the summer of 1969 that mark the birth of the modern gay and lesbian political movement. Duberman (<i>Paul Robeson</i> ) re-examines this event through the vibrant, intertwined portraits of six people -- two lesbians, three gay men, one transvestite -- whose lives converged at the Stonewall Rebellion and in the militant movement it spawned. Politically, his six subjects run the gamut from ex-priest Jim Fouratt -- a leftist and Yippie cohort of Abbie Hoffman -- to Foster Gunnison, who devoted his energies to moderate gay causes and later became a conservative. Yvonne Flowers, a black feminist, overcame her suspicion that the gay movement was not open to people of color, while transvestite Sylvia Rivers faced hostility from lesbians. Duberman, himself gay, exposes schisms in gay liberation that pitted gay men against lesbians, male chauvinists against feminists, whites against blacks.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",13.9,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/64/9780452272064.jpg,Success,128,17.1

0-935480-63-3,City of Kings (Discoveries),"Castellanos, Rosario",Latin American Literary Review Press,144.0,1993-01-01,,Paperback,"<p>Ciudad Real, as the Mexican city of San Cristobal de las Casas was called in earlier times, is the setting for this 1960 collection of stories by Rosario Castellanos that treats the passionate and timely themes of race, class, power and language. Set in the southern region of Chiapas where Castellanos was born, City of Kings [Ciudad Real] explores the centuries-old domination of indigenous people by whites, and the complex relationship between conquerors and conquered that is its outcome. Each story weaves into the next to present a portrait of the men, women and children of the region, with their hopes, tragedies, beliefs and fears. Most of all, City of Kings reveals the pain and damage suffered by both the weak and the strong when exploitation is the basis for everyday life.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>These short stories, first published in Mexico in 1960, show Castellanos to be a first-rate writer whose understanding of Mexican culture is as disturbing as it is engrossing. Using the city of Ciudad Real--the eponymous City of Kings, once glorious but now ``a vain, empty shell''--as a unifying element, she explores how racism, hunger, religion and money become weapons for the rulers of a society built upon the domination of native peoples. An elderly woman bludgeons an Indian to death, but calms her fears that his spirit will haunt her by thinking, ``How could a spirit possibly appear if the body belonged to an Indian, and not to a rational person?'' A proud native tribe and its protective spirit are exterminated by Spanish oligarchs and their descendants. A baby dies of hunger, yet the doctor who allows it to happen proclaims it a victory in getting Indians to understand the value of ``white'' medicine. A subtle paradox inhabits these unrelenting stories: Castellanos (1925-1974) was herself a wealthy ladina or white woman of mixed (European and indigenous) ancestry. She manages her exposure of the racist underpinnings of society brilliantly; more than 30 years after these stories were written, the inhumanity they portray continues to chill the soul.

Long before Judaism and Christianity, long before the Greco-Roman pantheon of gods and goddesses, the peoples of Western and Central Europe and the Near East worshipped a Goddess, seen in many guises, who encompassed both the awesome power of nature and the forces of life and death. The far reaches of her power found their expression in artifacts, sculptures and carvings, and at the sites where she was venerated - caves, sanctuaries, and temples - that have slept for thousands of years. Sanctuaries of the Goddess brings once-holy places dramatically back to life and recaptures their numinous power. The spiritual and archaeological significance of these ancient sites and their artifacts is conveyed in glowing photographs, from the caves of Lascaux in France to the awe-inspiring underground chambers of the Hypogeum on Malta, the mysteries of Ireland's Dowth and Knowth, and the mountain sanctuaries of Crete.

Pompous pediatricians, presumptive police, and an eager press cry ""satanism."" Bo knows better. She has long ago learned to heed her heightened perceptions and her own intuition. This time they tell her that this is no case of ritual abuse. Then the victim's sister vanishes, undoubtedly kidnapped by Massieu, and Bo is placed on the case. Tracking eight-year-old Hannah Franer leads her to the misty hills of New York's Hudson Valley and the cult's ""hideout."" But Bo sees no evil here, a feeling underscored by the cult leader, an Iroquois mystic who is as wise as she is ageless. Two other things Bo senses strongly: Paul Massieu is not guilty; and only the truth can free young Hannah from the psychic torment that could destroy her. Following her instincts, Bo vows to uncover the real monster and save the lives of future victims. It is a desperate search that will lead Bo into the deepest recesses of the mind and the darkest caverns of the earth.

Three Of Its Six Parts Appear Here For The First Time. Three Of Them Have A Seed, Seedling, Or Partly Grown Plant In A Previously Published Article.

Since There Seems To Be No Genre For This, I've Found Myself Explaining It This Way: If You Added Water To Any Of These Parts, It Would Become A Book. What If Freud Were Phyllis Is The Ultimate Send-up - With Footnotes.

Sex, Lies And Advertising Updates And Greatly Expands Steinem's Famous Expose Of Advertising's Stranglehold On Women's Magazines And Its Control Over Much Of What We See And Read - With A New And Urgent Call To Action. The Masculinization Of Wealth Shows Us The Ways Class Works In Reverse For Women In Families Of Inherited Wealth, Because The Closer We Are To Power, The More Passive We Have To Be Kept. It Reshapes Our Understanding Of Class, And Exposes The Other End Of The Feminization Of Poverty. Revaluing Economics Demystifies Budgets, From Our Own Checkbooks To National And International Accounting Systems, As Statements Of Values That Render Invisible Most Of The World's Productive Work, Especially That Done By Women - And Offers Practical Ways Out.

W. Harper is a central figure in the history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century African-American literature and intellectual thought. The foremost poet of the ""free colored community,"" she was also a lecturer,</p>
<p>educator, essayist, and novelist. A prolific champion of the abolitionist and feminist causes, she has come to be recognized for the critical role she played in the rise of the women's movement, particularly in the development of the black women's movement. Yet neither her art nor her political insight was preserved by subsequent generations until recently.</p>
<p>In this important study, poet Melba Joyce Boyd analyzes Harper not simply as a feminist and an activist, but as a writer. Boyd reads her in context, placing Harper's life, poetry, novels, and speeches within the nineteenth century African-American quest for</p>
<p>""freedom and literacy.""</p>
<p>Harper's genius is illuminated as Boyd traces her radicalism through her struggles with issues of race, gender, and class, and the other personal and social injustices she</p>
<p>confronted. Discarded Legacy comprises three parts: ""The Abolitionist Years,"" ""The Pursuit of the Promised Land,"" and ""The Woman's Era."" These divisions characterize the thrust of the historical periods which encompass Harper's lifetime and the thematic</p>
<p>focus of her writings. Though Harper's primary political emphasis is on slavery and the Reconstruction, she sustains a strong feminist voice throughout these times and in all of her writings. Likewise, during the women's era, she maintains an anti-racist stance and strongly criticizes racism in white</p>
<p>feminist politics.</p>
<p>Boyd's response to Harper's work is interactive and improvisational, and whenever possible, she maintains Harper's voice, allowing her to speak about her own work. When analyzing Harper's language, Boyd provides insight into Harper's aesthetic by</p>
<p>discussing the writings thematically and structurally within a biographical framework. Finally, by examining Harper's use of traditional poetic techniques, language, oral tradition forms, and other tools, Boyd</p>
<p>demonstrates how Harper's art and politics are synthesized into a dynamic whole.</p>
<p>This book weaves Harper's radical vision with the intuitive and analytical dimensions of her imagination and language. Through perceptive explication of Harper's writings and</p>
<p>consideration of her thematic inclinations and political and social affiliations, Boyd is able to show how Harper crafted her subjects and how the literature and speeches interrelated</p>
<p>in theme and historical experience. Boyd has successfully arranged Harper's work in a manner that connects our present to Harper's past and that re-envisions her consciousness.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.98546631114 Pounds, Width: 0.5625 Inches",2.31,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/99/9780814324899.jpg,Success,116,17.1

This Caricature Was Never True, But Alison Jaggar's Living With Contradictions Is The First Book To Demonstrate Just How Rich And Complex Feminist Ethics Has Become. Beginning With The Modest Assumption That Feminism Demands An Examination Of Moral Issues With A Commitment To Ending Women's Subordination, This Anthology Shows That One Can No Longer Divide Social Issues Into Those That Are Feminist And Those That Are Not.living With Contradictions Does Address Many Of The Traditionally Feminist Issues. But It Also Includes Issues Not Generally Recognized As Gendered, Such As Militarism, Environmentalism, And The Treatment Of Animals, Demonstrating The Value Of A Feminist Perspective In These Cases. And, Far From Reflecting Any Monolithic Orthodoxy, The Book Shows That There Is A Rich Diversity Of Views On Many Moral Issues Among Those Who Share A Feminist Commitment. Readers Can Sample A Varied Selection Of Papers And Essays From Books, Journals, Newspapers, And Grassroots Newsletters. Covering A Wide Range Of Moral Issues, This Collection Refuses To Offer Simple Solutions, Choosing Instead To Reflect The Complexities And Contradictions Facing Anyone Attempting To Live Up To Feminist Ideals In A Painfully Pre-feminist World.

So opens Gretel Ehrlich's absorbing account of being struck by lightning. Only when she fell to the ground, her head and body hitting on rock, was she jolted back to consciousness, back to life. In this astonishing chronicle of her experience and of the physical, psychological, and spiritual consequences of the encounter, the author turns her acute naturalist's eye on herself and on the natural world of the body to understand exactly what happened when lightning struck her. Woven into the narrative of her recovery is an examination of the heart - medical, religious, and cultural: There is the path of healing that she traveled not only with the requisite cardiologist but, to quite amazing effect, with her dogs as well. And finally, there is water, and the ways in which, in its contemplation and its immersion, she learned how fire can be extinguished. A Match to the Heart is a stunning work of observation and synthesis: bringing together the most minute self-exploratory and an enlarging, illuminating vision of the world.

                        <p>After nature writer Gretel Ehrlich was struck by lightning near her Wyoming ranch and almost died, she embarked on a grueling but often exhilarating journey back to the land of the living. Here she invites readers to share that journey, as she hungrily explores the natural and spiritual world to try and make sense of what happened to her.

By writing, I could put some distance between myself and my shame without stopping the process.... As I continued to heal and share my writing with other incest survivors, I was encouraged, supported, and validated by the notion that maybe my writing could help others. I had been keeping a detailed journal for several years and had no prior thoughts of ever publishing it or becoming a writer. Although there were some books on incest that described the process, I had not come across one that revealed those many intimate steps a survivor would need to take, such as walking through the feelings of shame convinced that you are going to die, or the terror of discovering one's sexual identity that is free from abuse.

1-56023-051-7,Bringing Ethics Alive: Feminist Ethics in Psychotherapy Practice,"Gartrell, Nanette",Routledge,128.0,1994-04-06,,Paperback,"<p>Gain fresh theoretical and practical perspectives of feminist ethics in psychotherapy from this groundbreaking book. The combined effect of increases in the population of minorities in the U.S. and the number of women in psychotherapy practice will have great impact on the future of the mental health profession. Psychotherapy practitioners and students must learn how to make ethical considerations concerning gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Bringing Ethics Alive is the only book of its kind that deals with the multicultural aspects of ethics in mental health services and discusses specific objectives for incorporating ethics in psychotherapy education.</p>
<p>Divided into two sections, Bringing Ethics alive focuses on both theoretical and practical issues of ethics in feminist therapy. The first section addresses theory by emphasizing the ethical responsibility of training programs to incorporate discussions on issues of racism, sexism, and heterosexism into the curricula. The important principles that should be included in courses on ethics in psychotherapy are outlined and include in-depth explanations of the ethics of confidentiality, professional competence, and conflicts of interest. A model for reconceptualizing boundary definitions in therapy is also provided.</p>
<p>The second half of Bringing Ethics Alive provides insights on a wide range of ethical considerations in psychotherapy practice. Some of the specific issues discussed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>sexual abuse of clients by women therapists</li>
<li>experiences of women sexually abused by male therapists compared to women sexually abused by female therapists</li>
<li>a personal account of sexual misconduct in therapy from the point of view of the victim</li>
<li>the ethics code of the Feminist Therapy Institute and the difficulties in translating the code into practice</li>
<li>the inappropriate use of Native American spiritual practices or activities by non-Native American professionals
<p>Graduate students in psychology, social work, and counseling, psychiatric residents, psychologists, social workers, counselors, and counseling clergy, no matter what their level of experience, will benefit from this thought-provoking exploration of feminist ethics in theory and practice. With its multicultural viewpoint and clear definitions of ethical issues, Bringing Ethics Alive is an essential book for helping mental health professionals sort through the complex issues of ethics in feminist therapy.</p>
