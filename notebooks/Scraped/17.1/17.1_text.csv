Traditionally ABA has been very careful not to
schedule events to conflict with the membership

two groups of identified activists — people whose
experience is most needed at the Membership

MEMOIR OF A RACE TRAITOR
By Mab Segrest
Against the backdrop of the rampaging Far Right movement of the
1980s, southern activist Mab Segrest probes the complex
intersections of racism, misogyny, homophobia, and capitalism. In
these new essays and narratives she moves from reporting to
personal reflection to historical analysis in order to focus on the
primacy of racism in shaping U.S. history and its constant
complication of forces of gender and sexuality.
“None of this book is predictable. It's a unique document and thoroughly
fascinating. Segrest's book gives human faces to political behavior, and
some fresh meanings to the term ‘family values’.” — Adrienne Rich

THE ME IN THE MIRROR
Connie Panzarino
“Connie Panzarino touches on a host of issues — among them self-image, care-giving and
-taking, equality in education and employment, sexuality and reproductive rights, and health
care — which no humane and inclusive society can afford to ignore. Her candor and energy
provide a model for truly enabled living.” - Nancy Mairs, author of Ordinary Time
“Connie Panzarino’s life story makes the theories of the disability rights movement flesh.
As she details her struggles with education, work and love, those who haven’t shared her
experiences will be shocked at the ignorance and injustice she has battled against. Those of us
who are disabled women will find a reflection of our lives in the mirror of hers.”

Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works edited by
Bonnie Clearwater is a book that many people have
been waiting for. Cuba-born Mendieta (1948-1985)
was a feminist activist artist who used images of her
body in dramatic ways: burning them into grass
and carving them onto cave walls. The controversy
over her death (her husband was tried and acquit-
ted of pushing her out a highrise window) brought
her to the attention of many outside the artworld,
but until recently books about her work have not
been available. In the introduction, editor/publish-

Maudďd’s House
MAUDS HOUSE A novel by Sherry Roberts
As a brilliant child artist, Maud Calhoun put Round Corners on the map
with paintings that covered every inch of her house. Now, pressured to
paint a mural for her small Vermont hometown, Maud searches for the
inspiration that has eluded her for ten years. With humor and warmth,
Maud struggles to reclaim herself, her love, and her art as her tightly-knit
community’s tale unfolds.
“. . . a reflective madcap comedy . . . it is what all great stories
are always about: love and sex and death; or to put the same
ideas another way: community and need and identity.”
—Orson Scott Card, author of The Lost Boys

Vagabond Press is a new feminist press that will
publish fiction and non-fiction “by and about our
heroes — women who fight back — about the war THE
against women and our strategies for fighting it.” “By AAA oN
publishing us and (then) putting us out of print [het-
eropatriarchal publishing houses] are disarming us.
Vagabond Press is an effort to provide an alternative CHRONICLES
and to prove that we need not ask for anything that
we are quite capable of providing for ourselves. So
we are not asking foundations and corporations for
grants and funding. We want to be independent of
these institutions and create a resource that is sup-
ported by women who believe and hope that writing
our resistance is only the first step.”
Vagabond’s first book, The Coming of Black
Genocide and Other Essays, collects articles that
appeared in Bottomfish Blues, an underground
Amazon publication that has appeared anonymous-
ly and episodically in New York City since 1986. Its
two main themes radically challenge white women’s
complicity in both the on-going Black Genocide and
the patriarchy’s war against women. The articles
reprinted in the book outline the parallels between
government policy against Blacks in America and
the development of nazi policies that were requisite
to making genocide in Germany a reality, outline the
radical history of the development of the women’s

Dear Feminist Bookseller,
We are thrilled to announce that Cleis Press will be represented to the trade by
Publishers Group West effective June 1, 1994. Please direct all orders to PGW.
We expect that many buyers—especially our friends in gay, lesbian and feminist stores—will
want to place new title orders with PGW sales reps, and then call Inland or BookPeople to re-stock their
shelves when those hot Cleis books fly out of the store!
Cleis Press titles will be as easy to order as ever— from Inland Book Co, BookPeople,
Ingram, Baker & Taylor, and PGW. InBook will accept retums through June 30, 1994; after that, books
purchased with InBook discounts should be returned to PGW.
Publishers Group West will debut its first women's catalog at the ABA, featuring women’s
books from Cleis Press, Seal Press, Conari Press, Four Walls Eight Windows, and others. Pick upa
copy at the Cleis booth, or visit PGW in booths #2035-2162.
Come see our hot Fall line at the ABA! We're still on Gay/Lesbian/Feminist Publishers Row...
