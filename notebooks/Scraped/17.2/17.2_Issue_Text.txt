now in hiding in an attempt to elude a police arrest on

Nasrin not to surrender to authorities.
A physician-turned-writer, Taslima Nasrin had
been under police protection since the fall of 1993
when the Bangladesh government banned her novel
Lajja (Shame), which was based on clashes between
Hindu and Muslim communities in India following
the December 1992 destruction of the Ayodhya
Mosque. Despite pleas from the international com-
munity, including PEN and Amnesty, the govern-
ment at Dhaka refused to lift the ban on her book or
to publicly condemn calls for her execution.

ABA 94
WHAT A SCENE!
By Carol Seajay
This year’s ABA was the busiest, most ener-
getic, encouraging ABA Convention in recent years.
Attendence for non-exhibitors (booksellers and oth-
ers) broke all ABA records. Part of the success of
this convention was that it was within driving dis-
tance for a large number of booksellers — and like
the last California convention, many booksellers
waited until the last minute, then decided to go and
just jumped in the car.
Publishers were, of course, glad to see more
booksellers, but the excitement at the convention,
and the vitality that so strongly marked this year’s
convention, was clearly a result of ABA’s Friday
morning announcement that ABA was sueing five On the aisle at ABA.

This suit is the most recent in a long series of legal
actions attempting to gain a level playing field for
independent booksellers. The first major case was
filed in 1982 by the Northern California Booksellers
Association and Cody’s Bookstore against
Hearst/ Avon. In this case, which took four years from
start to finish, the court ruled against Hearst/Avon,
saying that the publisher failed to justify the 7.3% dis-
count differential given to chains. Hearst/Avon had
argued, unsuccessfully, that the discount was related
to the cost of doing business. NCBA’s lawyer was was

OLIVIA
AN ANTHOLOGY OF LESBIAN
LITERATURE FROM THE SEVENTEENTH
CENTURY TO THE PRESENT
EDITED BY Lillian Faderman
Lillian Faderman, bestselling author of Odd Girls
and Twilight Lovers, covers four centuries of lesbian
and bisexual writing in this startling volume, the
most complete compilation of its kind, and one
that reveals Faderman’s own personal search for
the definition of “lesbian literature.”
Arranged in themed sections are a generous and wide range of selections—from
17th-century poets Katherine Fowler Philips and Aphra Behn to such modern
writers as Jeanette Winterson, Adrienne Rich, Rita Mae Brown, Amy Lowell and
Alice Walker. This landmark work is certain to become a point of reference from
which all studies of lesbian literature will begin.
