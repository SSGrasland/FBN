Racism, as with all such cross-cultural events, was

as I listened in workshop after workshop, at how little
I know about about so many women’s experiences,
despite my best intentions. At how important it is for
feminist presses to publish these experiences and how
essential it is for feminist publishing to be multicultur-
ally based so that we may be knowledgeable enough
to publish and circulate these stories with the honor
and respect they deserve.
Aboriginal women spoke at different times,
from different panels and platforms, about the
incredible destruction and abuse that they as indi-
viduals, that other members of their families, or
their entire communities, had experienced under
205 years of white rule. Particularly difficult to hear
were the stories of children — often times the
woman speaking — being taken from their parents
and sent to missionary schools. Stories so difficult to
hear, in part, because they are so common to my

generally ordered direct from the publisher in each
country and must be prepaid.
Distribution is Nour's biggest challenge and they
believe their long term success will depend on their
ability to successfully confront these difficulties.
Major distributors are not interested in the books
Nour is publishing. When queried, one said, “If the
books are about women’s issues, we'll take one or
two for our library. If it’s by a famous person, we'll
take 1,000. If it’s about sex, we'll take 2,000-3,000.”
So Nour is taking other approaches. They pub-
lish a newsletter which includes book reviews,
information about publications by women, news
about women across the region and encouragement
for women writers, and will, of course, include
information about the books they publish and dis-
tribute. It will also generate direct mail orders for
the books Nour publishes and distributes from
women throughout the Arabic speaking world.

for our booklists. Women indicate what lists they
want, and we send them out after the conference.

suburb of Adelaide.
“A local dyke real-estate agent pointed out that
several women’s businesses had opened out in
Semaphore. It seemed like the place to be, so we
started looking for a place to open...,” Robyn told
us. After being turned down by several landlords as
“undesirable” (read feminist and/or lesbian), they
were accepted as tenants in a just-renovated old
movie theatre owned by the city council. The other
tenants in the building are a mother-and-daughter-
owned ice cream parlor and tea shop, and the local
library. There’s also a room upstairs in the building
that the Sisters can use for readings and receptions.
All three tenants generate traffic for the others.

The store itself is small — perfect for picking up
beach reading in the summer. Children’s books are
among the best selling sections in this suburban
community. Fiction and biography also sell well,
but lesbian books, during the winter anyway, make
up less than 10% of the sales, a trend that will likely
turn around when the summer sun returns.
Murphy Sisters, the main store, is about 12
years old. It was started by lesbians, and the name
is “an Australian thing” based on referring to spin-
sters (Irish and otherwise) as “the Murphy sisters.”
The store flourished during its first incarnation,
then was sold to “a group of people, including a
man” just as the recession hit Australia. Sales fell,
due to a combination of factors including the reces-
sion, absentee ownership, poor management, and
the fact that local feminists and lesbians didn’t like Ann Marie Pedl e cr a l la in ns gw e tr hs e a o tc hu es rt o m stoer r e q ou ner y t h o e n f ao xn e p hp oh no en .e by

ership and the store is just reaching the point of minding the Semaphore shop.
Air-freight and consolidated shipments from
Bookpeople mean that Murphy Sisters can have
new feminist press books on the shelf within a
week of the time they arrive in U.S. stores. Despite
the geography, ordering from Bookpeople is often
faster and cheaper than ordering from local distrib-
utors. But Australia has laws that protect distribu-
tors so that, once the books are available from an
Australian distributor, bookstores may not order
additional copies from abroad, even if the books are
available at a better price (even including air-ship-
ping from the U.S).
Aboriginal books for adults and children are
one of Murphy Sisters’ specialties, selling to both
retail and school markets. About 25% of the store's
wall-space is given to displaying these books and
many titles are double-shelved in the children’s,
women’s biographies, or Australian fiction sections.
Titles are selected in concert with a council of
Aboriginal elders who evaluate the quality of the
books. If the council concludes that a book is
exploitative or harmful, it isn’t stocked.
While it’s easy to imagine that the tea shop next
door to Sisters by the Sea generates traffic for the
bookstore, it’s harder to imagine — but just as true —

Shrew, the Melbourne feminist bookshop,
opened in 1983 in the location it still occupies.
Then it was considered a “dangerous” neighbor-
hood with a lot of pubs, labor unions, “single
women,” and some gang fights. “But the rent was
cheap and, while the neighborhood did have a rep-
utation, it was actually OK,” Shrew’s owner Jean
Steel told us. As time passed, other alternative
businesses discovered the low rents and moved
into the neighborhood. Now Shrew is in the heart
of Melbourne’s alternative community and right
on the path between the Feminist Book Fair and a
host of gay-owned and alternative community
restaurants and coffee shops.

ONE TEACHER IN TEN
Gay and lesbian educators tell their stories
edited by Kevin Jennings
Gay and lesbian teachers have traditionally dwelt in the
deepest of closets. But increasing numbers of young people
are now served by teachers who are out and proud. Here,
for the first time, educators from all regions of the country
tell about their struggles and victories, as they have put
their own careers at risk in their fight for justice.

THE NEXT STEP
Long-term recovery in the lesbian community
OUT FROM UNDER, Volume Two
edited by Jean Swallow
Ten years after the publication of her widely loved and
groundbreaking book about lesbians and recovery, Jean
Swallow takes a new look at long-term recovery in the
lesbian community. Here are heartbreaking stories, fine
writing, and raw courage. “If you want to know where
we've been for the last ten years,” writes Swallow, “take
a look: we went away and came back whole. These are
our stories.”

a fascinating way to use computers, and an exciting way WAAN
to experience a book. Since these titles attract the same
type of buyer as books (a literate information seeker),
bookstores seem to me to be the perfect sales venue.
I think it’s especially important that women
become involved in new media. Women are under-
represented on the information highway and in these
new technologies. We haven’t been as involved as
men in production, sales or purchase of these new
technologies. As a result, there are very few titles out
there that seem appropriate for inclusion in a femi-
nist store. However, I have found some titles that I
think are perfect matches for us, and these could
help us gain a foothold in this male bastion. If you're b

Survives the Cultural Revolution
James R. Ross
In this compelling biography, James R. Ross integrates
interviews and contemporary history to present a
vivid picture of the horrifying ordeals suffered
by Wen Zengde (1900-1988), a Chinese American
woman who returned to China in 1956 to teach
English and was caught up in the turmoil of the
Cultural Revolution.
“A solid account of one woman's remarkable physical
and moral endurance.” — Kirkus Reviews

WOMEN OF THE GOLDEN DAWN
Rebels and Priestesses
Maud Gonne, Moina Mathers, Annie Horniman, Florence Farr
Mary K. Greer • ISBN 0-89281-516-7 ° $29.95 cloth
These four remarkable women left a lasting imprint on the politics,
literature, and theater of 19th-century Europe. Less well-known
than the famous men in their lives, including Yeats and Shaw, their
stories are now told, unhindered by the Victorian strictures they
rejected. Together with other creative and intellectual men and
women they formed the core of the Hermetic Order of the Golden
Dawn, studying magic and developing rituals for spiritual growth.
Throughout their lives they championed social and spiritual change,
and represented both the “new woman” and the “new age.”

Will Brantley, Southern Quarterly. “Taken as a whole,
the essays present a coherent and persuasive case

Born in 1959, Ding Xiaoqi is one of China’s most controversial
and discussed contemporary writers. Her stories about modern
Chinese women --- stories which explore such taboo subjects as
rape and adultery -- place her at the forefront of the new wave
of women’s literature. An illuminating picture of post-Maoist
China by a gutsy and talented writer. First time in English.

PRECISE INTRIGUES Mary Angeline
By Mary Angeline
“Mary Angeline’s poems seem to be on their way from this world to
some other, a dark and fascinating journey. They catch, by little more
than a blur of motion, the body's fall into spirit.”
Keith Waldrop
“Vision — the ability to see but also to interpret thereby — and Providence
— the ascription of beneficient meanings to what is seen. These are the two
eyes out of which Mary Angeline looks in these brilliant, spare lyrics.”

PARIS, WHEN IT's NAKED PARIS, WHEN IT'S NAKED
by Etel Adnan
Paris, When It's Naked is a post-colonial look at Paris, a narrative
both crucial and innovative.
“This gem of a book..….is the testimony of a lover whose conscience is
stricken...The lover is Adnan herself, the object of her desire is Paris and
the forbidden fruits are her past and present allegiances...Her range is
exhilarating.”

OF CITIES AND WOMEN UN
(Letters to Fawwaz) (Letters to Fawwaz)
By Etel Adnan ETEL ADNAN
“But where Paris, When It’s Naked delves into the accumulated lay-
ers of the self, Of Cities and Women is more concerned with the
nature of race itself, its definition and redefinition, through philo-
sophical speculation, observations on the relations between artists and
their ostensible subjects, between women and cities, between women
and men.”
“An exquisite lyric sensibility (a cross between the mysticism of such great
medievals as Rabia and Hildegard of Bingen and the American lucidity
of Emily Dickinson or Lorinne Niedecker) generously infuses Adnan's THE POST APOLLO-PRESS
