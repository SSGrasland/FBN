Elliot became increasingly drawn to these women, spending more and more time in it and other shelters, making notes and getting to know the inhabitants. This book is is the result. Unveiling the problems inherent in the current system of providing for the homeless is only part of the dynamic at work here. <i>Tell Them Who I Am</i> gives real voice to these women and theie stories. They are clearly human beings, and Elliot does nothing to strip them of their dignity or humanity. If any criticism could be made I suppose it might to suggest that Elliot is too close to his subjects. Perhaps this is an apt counter to most of the distancing, impartial-observer accounts of the homeless common to social science texts. There is no feelings of these women as bugs under a microscope.

Although The Angel Of History Is A Departure From Her Previous Books, It Contains Echoes Of Both Earlier Volumes. Placed In The Context Of Twentieth-century Moral Disaster - War, Genocide, The Holocaust, The Atomic Bomb - Forche's Third Collection Of Poems Is A Meditation On Memory, Specifically On How Memory Survives The Unimaginable. The Poems Reflect The Effects Of Such Experience: The Lines, And Often The Images Within Them, Are Fragmented, Discordant. But Read Together, These Lines Become A Haunting Mosaic Of Grief, Evoking The Necessary Accommodations Human Beings Make To Survive What Is Unsurvivable. These Are Personal Poems, Poems Startling In Their Honesty And Humility, Poems That Bear Witness Rather Than Explain Or Resolve. Carolyn Forche Describes Her Book In A Note To The Reader: The Angel Of History Is Not About Experiences. It Is For Me The Opening Of A Wound, The Muffling And Silence Of A Decade, And It Is Also A Gathering Of Utterances That Have Lifted Away From The Earth And Wrapped It In A Weather Of Risen Words.

Living without plumbing, electricity, or a telephone, she discovered in herself a new independence and a growing sense of oneness with the world that redefined her notions of waste, time, necessity, and pleasure. With wit, lyricism, and fearless honesty, Shulman describes a quest that speaks to us all: to build a new life of creativity and spirituality, self-reliance and self-fulfillment.</p>

Things could be worse...and they're about to get that way. Just north of Billings, there's a place called Whispering Pines. It's a nice, gentle name, a fitting name for a rehab center. But what happens there is anything but gentle, and the things Phoebe finds out about the people who run it, about her brother, and about some of the other things that happen under the Big Sky, leave the pines anything but whispering.

But the woman seeking help with her daughter has an ace up her sleeve. In the file she turns over there's a picture of a young woman wearing a silver Medic-Alert bracelet - and that little piece of jewelry belonged to Phoebe's dead brother.

As the family slowly disintegrates, its members struggle valiantly against the powerful forces of loneliness and necessity, seeking a sense of home and place forever lost.<P>Loyal Blood, eldest son, is forced to abandon the farm when he takes his lover's life, thus beginning a quintessentially American odyssey of solitude and adventure. Yearning for love, yet forced by circumstance to be always alone, Loyal comes to symbolize the alienation and frustration behind the American dream.<br></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this poignant first novel by Proulx ( Heart Songs and Other Stories ), artfully misspelled postcards form the tenuous links between ill-fated young trapper Loyal Blood and his family--Mink and Jewelle, Dub and Mernelle--who eke a meager existence from their ancestral Vermont farm. When Loyal accidentally kills his saucy redheaded sweetheart Billy while making love in the fields, he hides her body in a stone-covered fox den. Abruptly he tells his family that he and Billy are heading west to ``make a new start.'' In a vengeful rage his father Mink shoots Loyal's cows. Loyal endures harsh years of self-imposed exile as, from 1944 to the '80s, he roves from job to job--mining, fossil picking, trapping--each authoritatively detailed. Racked with gagging seizures whenever he tries to touch another woman, sick in his lungs, Loyal doggedly accepts his lot without complaint. Back home the violent, feckless Bloods fall into ruin, attempting arson, serving jail terms and losing the farm, which is sold for trailer parks. Flurries of postcards fly, both personal and commercial: brother Dub answers one for an artificial limb, desperate sister Mernelle responds to a lonely lumberman's ad for a wife. Proulx writes a rich, sensuous prose; she captures the earthy, hard-bitten voices of men and women resigned to travail and documents the passing of an epoch. If there is a fault, it is the overabundance of minor characters randomly introduced into the narrative.

This book explores the resonances of gay, lesbian and queer experience in American culture, particularly in the past thirty years. In a Different Light engages a range of queer issues, aesthetic concerns, and formal styles. Instead of inquiring What does lesbian or gay art look like? the curators ask: How are queer artists looking at the world? This is the first time that a major American museum has considered this important subject in a broad cross-generational context. The inclusion of literary work in the context of this exhibition catalog brings into focus the relationships between artists and writers in lesbian and gay culture, the interaction of genres and media in these representations, and the impact of visual culture - the arts, popular iconography, advertising, and style - on the formation of identity.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",29.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/02/9780872863002.jpg,Success,72.0,17.6

Women played the central role in this development. In Mother-Work, Molly Ladd-Taylor explores both the private and public aspects of childrearing, using the direct relationship between them to shed new light on the histories of motherhood, the welfare state, and women's activism in the United States. Mother-work, defined as ""women's unpaid work of reproduction and caregiving,"" was the motivation behind women's public activism and ""maternalist"" ideology. Ladd-Taylor emphasizes the connection between mother-work and social welfare politics by showing that their mothering experiences led women to become active in the development of public health, education, and welfare services. In turn, the advent of these services altered mothering experiences in a number of ways, including by reducing the infant mortality rate. By examining women's activism in organizations including the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations, the U.S. Children's Bureau, and the National Woman's Party, Ladd-Taylor dispels the notion of ""mother-work"" as a contradictory term and clarifies women's role in the development of the American economic system.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 0.67 Inches, Length: 9.02 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 6.01 Inches",28.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/21/9780252064821.jpg,Success,110.0,17.6

This rich and bewitching story is a bittersweet portrait of the people in Santiago, a Mexican village by the sea. Chayo, the flower seller, and her husband Candelario, the salad maker, are finally blessed with the child they thought they would never have. Their cause for happiness, however, triggers a chain of events that impact the lives of everyone in their world.<P> The hopes, triumphs, failures, and shortcomings of the novel's enchanting array of characters create a graceful picture of life that is both a universal portrait and an insider's look at life in Latin America.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Latina writer Benitez begins her excellent debut novel with a painful event--the wait for a drowned body to float to shore--and works backwards, retracing the myriad, seemingly insignificant steps that led to the character's death. As in Like Water for Chocolate , this novel sympathetically explores the lives of Mexican women caught in a mystical, fatalistic world. Chayo, a flower seller, and her sister Marta, a chambermaid, live in a poverty-stricken village by the sea. When 15-year-old Marta is raped and becomes pregnant, seemingly barren Chayo and her husband, Candelario, agree to take the child. Soon after, however, Chayo discovers that she too is expectant and reneges on the promise. Livid, Marta arranges with el brujo , the witch doctor, to put a curse on her sister's child. Both women bear sons, and a remorseful Marta tells her sister about the curse, which she claims to have had removed by la curandera , the healer. But when Chayo's son almost dies after being bitten by fire ants, the sisters' relationship once more deteriorates and, inexorably, the tragedy presaged in the book's opening chapter comes to pass. Benitez's unsparing vision into the stark realities of village residents' lives offers a poignant counterpoint to superficial vacation snapshots of Mexico.

An American public smitten with her wit, frankness, and ""unladylike"" bravado helped her become an American legend. In Babe, Susan Cayleff offers a comprehensive, in-depth biography of a woman who was a great athlete at a time when women's roles and opportunities were severely limited. Through interviews with Babe's friends and family, golf peers, and medical personnel, Cayleff sensitively reveals the life and probes the legend of this unusual American hero. Included is a for-the-record discussion of the remarkable love Babe shared with Betty Dodd, the young golfer who was her constant companion in her last years. Stricken with cancer in her prime, Babe went public as a self-help role model able to beat the disease. Her bravery further endeared her to the American public.

It was Chevrillon and her team who coded many of the telegrams in Is Paris Burning? Until now, little has been published about this unglamorous but vital aspect of the French Resistance. Chevrillon's memoir gives abundant detail about what daily life was like for the French elite during the German occupation. Her father, a scholar and literary critic who had been raised by his celebrated uncle, philosopher-historian Hippolyte Taine, put her in contact with the upper circles of French culture. Her mother, who was from a large, assimilated Jewish family, gave her firsthand knowledge of the persecution of French Jews. Her story vividly portrays the wartime experience of private lives and public events, including the tedious backroom work of the Resistance and four months she spent captive in Paris's dreaded Fresnes prison.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>A witness to the bleak fate of French Jewry in Nazi-dominated France, this remarkable author recounts her experiences from 1939 to 1945 in a personal though emotionally reserved way that makes her family's tragedies particularly poignant. Her parents were upper-class, assimilated Jews; her father, Andr Chevrillon, was a member of the French Academy, a man Edith Wharton called ``the first literary critic in France.'' An English teacher in Paris when war broke out, Claire gives abundant details about the first days of the occupation, when France became a nation divided between the Ptainists and those less willing to accommodate Hitler's designs. In 1942, as repressive laws limited Jewish freedom (Claire's mother was effectively imprisoned by her fear of leaving home wearing the yellow star), as her brother-in-law languished in a POW camp and her cousins were persecuted and eventually deported, Chevrillon joined the resistance, first in air operations and then in the code service, where she encoded and decoded messages between the free French government in London and de Gaulle's Paris delegation. Chevrillon, who had contact with some of the most prominent members of the resistance, was betrayed in 1943 and spent four harrowing months in prison. The author's goal was ``to set forward the facts... not to analyze myself or my characters.'' But her story, told without elaboration, is as dramatic and compelling as any fiction. Illustrations.

1-56023-061-4,Older Women With Chronic Pain,"Roberto, Karen A",Routledge,138.0,1994-12-02,,Paperback,"<p>This much-needed book explores the issues and consequences of chronic pain in later life. Chronic pain often accompanies the non-fatal health conditions experienced by older women, but much of the professional literature virtually ignores older chronic pain sufferers. Older Women With Chronic Pain begins to fill this void by exploring chronic pain and its effects on older individuals. Authors draw upon existing pain literature, their knowledge of aging, and recognition of the health issues facing older women to illuminate the particulars of chronic pain in later life in relation to its etiology, assessment, consequences, and management.</p>
<p>Chronic pain is not and should not be treated as part of the natural aging process. This book stresses the importance of understanding the causes and consequences of living with chronic pain in later life. Among the specific areas that chapters explore are:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical and biomedical aspects of chronic pain in later life</li>
<li>the importance of using a comprehensive strategy for assessing chronic pain in older women</li>
<li>coping strategies used by older women with chronic musculoskeletal pain</li>
<li>issues associated with cancer pain and pain management in later life</li>
<li>the influence of chronic pain on the family relationships of older women</li>
<li>nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of chronic pain in older women
<p>The book includes a thorough review of the geriatric literature as well as suggestions for future research in the area of women with chronic pain. Researchers and academicians interested in the health concerns of older women, and clinicians and practitioners working with older women (and men) with chronic pain will find this book full of insightful information to help them in their work.</p>

They were gay in the truest sense, not just in their sexuality. We still marvel at their creative accomplishments. They led dazzling lives on both sides of the Atlantic: the stages of New York and London, the studios of Hollywood and the mansions of Beverly Hills, and the cafe society playgrounds of Paris, Venice and the Riviera. They were famous and rich. They set fashion and the rules of sophisticated love. And they did all this for over half a century while keeping their homosexuality a secret. Although their astonishing output was deeply influenced by their sexuality, they feared exposure and went to tragic lengths to hide their true identities. This new book, like the men it so honestly portrays, has a dual purpose. It combines revealing biographical portraits of Porter and Coward with an absorbing account of the homosexual world that shaped their creative work. Joseph Morella and George Mazzei take a fresh approach to lives that remain unendingly interesting. Extensive new interviews with still-living friends, lovers and colleagues highlight this new look at our theatrical culture, and this book treats frankly the lovers of the two men and the parts they played in the artists' lives. This dual biography also shows how sexual scandals have ruined stars throughout show business history - and that surprisingly little has really changed in the public perception of homosexuals since the days of Noel and Cole.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.3007273458 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/74/9780786702374.jpg,Success,117.0,17.6

It is the unflinchingly honest first-person account of a man breaking free of a lifetime of silence and isolation.<br>
<br>
Born to a young Samoan father and Northern European mother, and adopted at nine months, Greg began diving at age nine, and at sixteen won a silver medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. But despite his astonishing athletic skill, Greg struggled with late-detected dyslexia, prejudice toward his dark skin coloring and anguish over his homosexuality, which he felt compelled to hide. Being in the spotlight intensified his difficulties with relationships and substance abuse.<br>
<br>
However, Louganis went on to win double gold medals at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. His triumph at the 1988 Olympics came several months after he tested positive for HIV. This is the haunting, searingly candid story of the world's greatest diver. This new edition includes a new foreword.<br>

This is the first in-depth study to examine issues of identity and difference within feminism by drawing on Walker's notion of an essential black feminist consciousness. Allan defines womanism as a (r)evolutionary aesthetic that seeks to fully realize the feminist goal of resistance to patriarchal domination, demonstrated most powerfully in The Color Purple. She also recognizes the complexities and ambiguities embedded in the concept, particularly the notion of a fixed and unitary black feminist identity, separate and distinct from its white counterpart. Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway and Drabble's The Middle Ground, she argues, do not allay Walker's concerns about white liberal feminist practice, but they reveal signs of struggle that complicate the womanist/feminist dichotomy. Emecheta's The Joys of Motherhood, an ostensibly womanist text, fails to fit the race-restrictive womanist paradigm, and Walker's own aesthetic trajectory - before The Color Purple - places her outside womanist boundaries. Finally, Allan's intertextual reading reveals significant commonalities and differences.

In her second book of poems, Cisneros ( My Wicked Wicked Ways ) presents a street-smart, fearlessly liberated persona who raves, sometimes haphazardly, always with abandon, about the real thing: ``I am . . . / The lust goddess without guilt. / The delicious debauchery. You bring out / the primordial exquisiteness in me.'' As if breaking all the rules (``Because someone once / said Don't / do that! / you like to do it''), she delves with urgency into things carnal--sequins, cigars, black lace bras and menstrual blood. Readers of Cisneros's coming-of-age novel The House on Mango Street (which Knopf is reissuing in hardcover) will recognize the almost mythic undertow of her voice; it never weakens. We meet again a powerful, fiercely independent woman of Mexican heritage, though this time innocence has long been lost. For her the worlds of language and life are one and the same: ``Lorenzo, I forget what's real. / I mix up the details of what happened / with what I witnessed inside my / universe.'' These poems--short-lined, chantlike, biting--insistently rework the same themes to tap them. In the end, however, despite the accessible boldness of the writing, the poems lack the depth, the complexity and the lyrical magic of the author's fiction.

But are they? When parents become employers, what does it mean for them, their children, and the nannies themselves? While parents may dream of Mary Poppins, seldom do they hire professional British nannies. Instead, most hire untrained women who have few other career options. Coming from different worlds, middle-class parents and their children's caregivers may not share a language - either literally or figuratively. Most parents do not know what their caregivers truly think about them, their young charges, or American child-rearing practices. Based on more than 150 interviews with caregivers and parents, this book explores the hidden side of caregiving relationships. Julia Wrigley asks how parents learn to be employers and why some fail at the task. The book is an unsparing examination of the poignant situations and conflicts that can arise when parents and caregivers share child rearing but little else. In their own words, caregivers tell of working long hours in aching isolation and boredom, asked to invest emotionally in children yet lacking any real authority over their charges. Parents tell of caregivers who disappear without warning or who define their jobs as watching children but not playing with them or helping them learn. The book examines parents' strategies to ensure that their children are raised according to their own values, even in their daily absence from the home. No strategy, however, can overcome all the problems created by unequal relationships within households. The book makes a compelling argument that professionally run child care centers better meet the needs of children and parents alike.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",0.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/04/9780465053704.jpg,Success,113.0,17.6

Larque's loved ones accept her uncanny, unconscious, often embarrassing habit of producing temporary doubles - ""doppelgangers"" - of people and their inner aspects from out of thin air. But now her latest creation, herself at age ten, refuses to fade away quietly - leaving Larque no choice but to bear the taunts and accusations of the scabby-kneed golliwog girl she once was. For the child, Sky, will not accept the compromises Larque has made in her life - and, ultimately, leads her older self out into the vast, adult and mysterious night in search of lost dreams. Larque's nocturnal wanderings take her farther from home and hearth than she ever imagined possible - to the neon pinks and Day-Glo yellows of Popular Street, where life is exciting and gay. Here in this secret place, she meets the beautiful, tormented cowboy Shadow - and Argent, the handsome stud-lover Shadow has molded from the pliable clay of middle-aged angst. And it is here, beneath Shadow's talented fingers, that Larque herself is remade - becoming a new ""Lark,"" younger, stronger, more courageous...and male. But freedom is a pricey commodity - and there are those who would gladly clip Larque's newly formed wings. Her loving, gentle, bearlike husband Hoot desperately wants her back - steadfastly refusing to accept his wife as a muscular, teenaged boy. And her disapproving mother is especially dangerous - since she has the power to ""blink"" her errant daughter into some maternally approved, no-warts ideal. But the most fearsome adversary of all lurks deep within an already splintered Larque/Lark - a doppelganger in sensible shoes who, if released, could swallow up the Harootunian family whole and leave Popular Street in ruins: the dreaded Virtuous Woman.

More recently, domestic violence, prostitution, sexual harassment, and pornography have come to the forefront of investigators’ concerns. <i>Rape and Society</i> returns to the original focus on rape, while also illuminating the interconnections among the many forms of violence against women.The book provides a comprehensive treatment of the subject, drawing on writers and researchers from across a range of social and behavioral sciences and the humanities and representing the experiences of women of diverse backgrounds and lifestyles. From the private torment of a child abused by her father to the horror of mass rape and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, the authors analyze rape as a tool of humiliation, control, and terror.<i>Rape and Society</i> is an essential resource for academics and professionals and for anyone wanting to come to grips with the magnitude of the problem of sexual violence. Because the selections are moving as well as thought-provoking and varied in approach (theoretical, empirical, literary, and experiential), this interdisciplinary anthology is a superb text for undergraduate and graduate courses in women’s studies, psychology, sociology, and criminology. It offers incisive analyses and carefully designed research to help us understand and explain rape while sensitizing us to the personal dimensions of sexual victimization and the emotional toll of living in a violent society. There are hopeful voices here too, helping readers envision a safer and more humane world, offering concrete suggestions for social change, and encouraging us all to gather the power and courage to take on the work that lies before us.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3007273458 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches",51.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/43/9780813388243.jpg,Success,98.0,17.6

The phenomenon subsequently acquired a discourse that has gone largely unchallenged in the intervening years. But do prevailing definitions of harassment adequately reflect the complexity of the issue? Or is it now time to challenge the conventional assumptions that underlie our approach to - and our ways of dealing with - the problem of harassment? Rethinking Sexual Harassment makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the issue by questioning the language we use to describe harassment and the assumptions we make when we think about it. It investigates the connections that exist between types of behaviour usually described as harassment; it reexamines the complicated relationship between gender and ethnicity, sexuality, age, religious belief and other aspects of identity; it scrutinises the ways in which harassment is perceived. Rethinking Sexual Harassment is an innovative and challenging contribution from feminists in Britain to an important and continuing debate.",en,,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.045 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches",23.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/88/9780745308388.jpg,Success,98.0,17.6

<p>The centerpiece of this volume is the acclaimed <i>Prison Notes</i>, a powerful account of the twenty-seven days Barbara Deming and thirty-five others spent in an Albany, Georgia, jail during their Canada-to-Cuba Walk for Peace in 1963 and 1964. Demanding that black demonstrators and white demonstrators be able to walk together, the peace marchers were imprisoned, leading many in the group to fast and employ other nonviolent techniques of protest. Their presence and discipline had a lasting effect on the Albany Movement and other nonpacifist civil rights groups in the South.</p>
<p>The remainder of the book relates Deming's final protest walk some twenty years later in 1983 with the Seneca Women's Peace Encampment, a group of women-only peace marchers scheduled to walk from Seneca, New York, the site of the first Women's Rights Declaration in 1848, to the missile base in Romulus, New York. This nonviolent march in honor of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other feminist heroines was interrupted by protestors. Deming and fifty-three other women were arrested and spent five days in a Waterloo, New York, jail. These events are told in ""A New Spirit Moves Among Us,"" an essay written in letter form to a friend in defense of women-only actions, an interview with Deming conducted after her release from jail, and a statement of purpose issued from jail by the Waterloo Fifty-Four.</p>
<p>As Grace Paley notes in her introduction, <i>Prisons That Could Not Hold</i> is ""the story of two walks undertaken to help change the world without killing it. Barbara Deming was an important member of both. Twenty years of her brave life lie between them. . . . That difference between the two walks measures a development in movement history and also tells the distance Barbara traveled in those twenty years.""</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 8.499983 Inches, Length: 5.499989 Inches, Weight: 0.9700339528 Pounds, Width: 0.82999834 Inches",9.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/73/9780820317373.jpg,Success,109.0,17.6

Trust Your Baby!: Childbirth Wisdom and Cesarean Prevention,"Henkart, Andrea F.",Praeger,200.0,1995-03-24,,Paperback,"<p>Includes chapter by Dr. John Gray, author of the best-selling, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus! Over one million cesarean sections are performed each year in America. Only one-half of these invasive procedures are medically necessary. In the name of technological progress, hundreds of thousands of women have been coerced into relinquishing a most cherished right—the right to give birth in a gentle, supportive environment, free of medical interventions. Many of these women suffer needlessly because they place their trust completely in doctors who view medical intervention and cesarean sections as a birthing panacea. American culture has conditioned women to fear pregnancy and childbirth. Now, more than ever, it is important for women to learn all the facts before giving birth. For instance, how many women know that cesarean delivery carries approximately four times the risk of maternal mortality compared to vaginal delivery? Or that being able to fully trust their own instincts and knowing how to accurately interpret the messages the body sends may be more important to a healthy delivery than any medical equipment? Women deserve to know this kind of information in order to see beyond the external considerations of childbirth so they can put themselves back in touch with the simple, peaceful, natural process of bringing a child into this world.</p>
<p><i>Trust Your Body! Trust Your Baby!</i> empowers women to face the challenges, fears, and decisions involved in giving birth today. Through anecdotal experiences, facts figures, and the contributions of well-known authors in the field, this rich volume offers fresh approaches to the aggressive procedures embraced by many doctors and women of child-bearing age. The physical, psychological, and cultural implications of cesarean sections are thoroughly examined. Also explored are many time-tested techniques such as visualization, massage, and exercises that can reposition breech babies as well as other invaluable hints for avoiding unnecessary cesarean sections. Completing this unique work is a detailed discussion of associated issues such as VBAC, the husband's role in childbirth, circumcision, and the far-reaching effects natural delivery can have on the baby's entire life. Appendices provide valuable information about questions to ask your doctor, steps in forming a successful birth plan, and sources for further guidance. Through insightful education and an understanding that can only come through experience, Henkart show how every woman possesses the ability to overcome the fear and uncertainty commonly associated with birthing in the 90s. When this ability is fully realized, women can once again hold the key to making childbirth the powerful, wondrous, life experience it is meant to be.</p>",en,New Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125972 Inches, Weight: 0.71 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/40/9780897892940.jpg,Success,119.0,17.6

Sari is a young dancer in the ancient Middle East, sold into slavery by her parents, brought as a virgin prize to the harem of an all-powerful ruler, and willingly seduced by his magnificently sensual Nubian favorite, a young woman clever beyond her years in the ways of the world and the flesh. Codie is a young writer and editor, living in present-day Manhattan, sharing her heart and her life with her first lover, a tough and tender woman at once immensely experienced and infinitely exciting. Each tells her love story in her own fresh and compelling voice. Sari unfolds a tale of high adventure and brutal violence, suspense set against a backdrop of harem intrigues, daring escape, and the hot flare of passion between women. Codie's story, filled with a sensual, dreamy longing for love, explores a complex girlhood and charts an affair that takes her on a journey of emotion and illumination, from her discovery of ecstasy to the shattering heartbreak of betrayal. Novelist Jan Carr takes us to a world of exotic splendor and ancient savagery, of palaces, walled cities, and wine-dark seas that is as vividly real as her contemporary New York City. Even more entrancingly, she has succeeded in creating two love affairs that reflect each other as magical mirror images. Were Codie and Dee lovers in another lifetime, or is Codie's growing obsession with the shimmering, distant harem world the stuff of her imagination? As the two stories converge, the ancient one reaches a harrowing and dramatic conclusion while the modern tale offers rebirth and liberation of the spirit.

                        <p>In this stunning debut novel, Carr explores a unique love between women--a love that is hauntingly linked by an unbreakable bond transcending centuries. Two love stories are told in a fresh and compelling voice, yet the two affairs become magical mirror images. One is in ancient Arabia--the other in Manhattan.

<p>Through the act of blessing, we awaken our appreciation of the world's abiding gifts. In <i>The Book of Blessings</i>, Marcia Falk re-creates Jewish prayer by offering new blessings, poems and meditations that focus on the sacred potential of each moment. Evoking the diversity of human experience, <i>The Book of Blessings</i> provides a collage of poetic form that invites us to celebrate ""the dynamic, alive and unifying wholeness within creation."" Steeped in dialogue within rabbinical tradition, it calls into question the tradition's patriarchal assumptions and challenges hierarchical structures of power.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking work in the literature of spirituality, <i>The Book of Blessings</i> offers, for the first time, a complete new liturgy, in Hebrew as well as English, for use in both house and the community on weekdays, Sabbaths and the festival of the New Moon. The liturgy is enhanced by a Commentary that illuminates its meanings for scholars and general readers alike.</p>
<p><i>The Book of Blessings</i> is for those who are in the habit of praying and for those who are not. It is for those dissatisfied withthe traditional liturgy and for those who wish to supplement it. <i>The Book of Blessings</i> is a part of an ongoing conversation that seeks to keep Judaism vital and responsive to our spiritual needs and moral concerns.</p>
<p>Poet and translator Marcia Falk received a B.A. in philosophy from Brandeis University and a Ph.D. in English and comparative literature from Stanford. She was a Fulbright Scholar and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she studied Bible and Hebrew literature. A university professor for many years, she now lectures widely. Her other books include <i>The Song of Songs: A New Translation and Interpretation</i> and <i>With Teeth in the Earth: Selected Poems of Malka Heifetz Tussman</i>.

<p>""Not since Miriam danced at the Red Sea or Deborah praised God in song has the voice of women's soul in prayer been so passionately articulated."" --Rabbi Naamah Kelman, Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism</p>
<p>""Marcia Falk's work on Hebrew blessings is as beautiful as it is innovative; and it is innovative in the sweetest, most nourishing sense, saturated in love for the language itself (its overtones and melodies as well as its deep structure), its history, its people. Even those who do not hear the traditional liturgies as exclusionary will respond to the meticulously flowering poet's passion of Marcia Falk's wholly original contribution."" --Cynthia Ozick</p>
<p>""If anyone can revive the habit of praying, it is Marcia Falk. <i>The Book of Blessings</i> is a collection of eloquent and inspiring prayers that avoid anthropomorphisms and male domination. Marcia Falk invites the so-called secularist to pray without sacrificing intellectual or moral integrity."" --Rabbi Ira Eisenstein, President Emeritus, Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, and Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, Ph.D., Hebrew Union College</p>
<p>""Falk's rare poetic, spiritual, and intellectual gifts ensure that this long-awaited volume of feminist prayer will remain an enduring treasure, expanding the vocabulary of Jewish liturgy and awakening and deepening awareness of the holy in every aspect of life."" --Judith Plaskow, author of <i>Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective</i></p>
<p>""This is a work of art, a comprehensive revisioning of Judaism's liturgical genius from the pen of consummate poet and Hebraist Marcia Falk."" --Rabbi Lawrence A. Hoffman, Professor of Liturgy, Hebrew Union College</p>
<p>About Marcia Falk's <i>The Song of Songs: A New Translation and Interpretation</i>:</p>
<p>""An exceptional poetic job. Marcia Falk has great power in her language."" --Isaac Bashevis Singer, Nobel Laureate</p>
<p> ""One of the great classics of the art of translation. It's always a thrill when (as rarely happens) the scholar's mind and the poet's soul come together."" --Adrienne Rich</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 2.55074837134 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches",17.07,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/01/9780060623401.jpg,Success,124.0,17.6

The interrelationship between the status of nursing and the status of women in patriarchal society is analyzed. Nursing's struggle to overcome its oppression and gain increased autonomy and political power is considered from an historical perspective. Early leaders in the profession, such as Florence Nightingale, Lavinia Dock, and Lillian Wald, are analyzed with regard to their social reform, political, and feminist activities. Nursing's support for the Equal Rights Amendment and its role in the women's movement that reemerged in the 1960s is examined in light of the profession's ambivalence to feminist issues. The last 20 years show that the profession has become actively aware of important issues such as pay equity and equal job opportunity and that nursing has become more cognizant and supportive of feminist goals on a variety of issues. This work provides a comprehensive review of the history of the nursing profession while simultaneously instructing in new paradigms of thought relative to provision of healthcare and human services by women.</p>

Sixty thousand copies in print!&nbsp;&nbsp;In her bestselling 1990 book, Sally Helgesen&nbsp;&nbsp;discovered that men and women approach work in&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentally different ways. Many of these differences&nbsp;&nbsp;hold distinct advantages for women, who excel at&nbsp;&nbsp;running organizations that foster creativity,&nbsp;&nbsp;cooperation, and intuitive decision-making power,&nbsp;&nbsp;necessities for companies of the twenty-first century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Helgesen's findings reveal that organizations run by&nbsp;&nbsp;women do not take the form of the traditional&nbsp;&nbsp;hierarchical pyranaid, but more closely resemble a&nbsp;&nbsp;web, where leaders reach out, not down, to form an&nbsp;&nbsp;interrelating matrix built around a central purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy of the web concentrates power at the&nbsp;&nbsp;center by drawing others closer and by creating&nbsp;&nbsp;communities where information sharing is essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;She presents her findings through unique, closely&nbsp;&nbsp;detailed accounts of four successful women&nbsp;&nbsp;business leaders — Frances Hesselbein of Girl Scouts&nbsp;&nbsp;USA, Barbara Grogan of Western Industrial&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors, Nancy Badore of Ford Motor Company's Executive&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Center, and Dorothy Brunson of Brunson&nbsp;&nbsp;Communications. Helgesen observes their meetings,&nbsp;&nbsp;listens to their phone calls and conferences, and&nbsp;&nbsp;reads their correspondence. Her ""diary&nbsp;&nbsp;studies"" document how women leaders make decisions,&nbsp;&nbsp;schedule their days, gather and disperse&nbsp;&nbsp;information, motivate others, delegate tasks, structure&nbsp;&nbsp;their companies, hire, and fire.

Her mother sees the sculpture, recognizes in it all the pain and frustration of their relationship over the years, and tries to take her own life. Forced together by this near tragedy, the daughter sits at her mother's bedside and relives her childhood years, confronting the specter of sexual conflict that haunts their pasts. Remembering this remote and beautiful woman, she must also remember the man who invaded their lives long ago, who insinuated and seduced his way first into her mother's affections and then, unforgiveably, into her own.... Creating a scandal when it was first published in the former Yugoslavia, this provocative and immensely readable novel explodes one of the last taboos in our western culture - the image of the sexual mother. Marble Skin explores the darkest recesses of the female psyche and exposes the destructive power of sexual desire when forced to compete with the bonds of maternal love.

Kunin ran for office it was because she thought there ought to be more women in politics. In time she fulfilled that belief by becoming the first woman governor of Vermont. Throughout her career, Kunin found that the rules for women politicians were different: she would not be forgiven (nor would she forgive herself) for neglecting her family. She could not afford to display emotion at the wrong times lest she be thought ""weak."" And she would have to learn to play political hardball with the best of them while keeping her integrity.</p>
<p>In Living a Political Life, Kunin-who is now Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education-takes a frank look at the challenges that confronted her as she tried not just to succeed in politics but to set a precedent for other women. In doing so, she illuminates both what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a public servant and gives us a memoir as thoughtful and revealing as any to emerge from the corridors of power.</p>


                        <p>One of America's first woman governors shows that women can succeed and make a difference in politics without sacrificing their values. Kunin's memoir ranges from her apprenticeship as a small-town newspaper reporter, wife, and mother, to her decision to leave state politics after almost two decades of service and achievement.

0-452-27381-1,Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay and Christian in America,"White, Mel",Plume,347.0,1995-04-01,,Paperback,"<p>Few issues divide our country more dangerously today than does the question of homosexuality and the conflict between the concept of family values and the individual rights of gays and lesbians. Families are divided, careers are ruined, lives are lost - all in the struggle between beliefs founded in tradition and those based on personal freedom. Spearheading the fight against the increasingly vocal homosexual community are the leaders of the so-called ""religious right,"" men and women who denounce gays and lesbians from their pulpits and encourage their followers to enact laws against them. Perhaps no one is better qualified to write about these issues and the conflicts they engender than Mel White. He was born into a conservative Christian home and educated in conservative Christian schools and churches. He met his wife there, and together they raised their children to believe in God and to follow a Christian lifestyle. He worked within the church as a filmmaker and writer, and eventually became a ghostwriter of books, autobiographies, and speeches for such noted figures in the religious right as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Billy Graham. But all that time Mel White had a secret. He was gay. In this remarkable book, Mel White looks at his own life in the church and details the struggles he went through to deny and overcome his own natural sexual desires. And in ways sure to anger many of the people he used to know best, he provides a firsthand look at the teachings and workings of the religious right today, showing how they use their power first to politicize their followers and then, using these politics, to spearhead fund-raising efforts. Most specifically, he examines the methods they use to create a campaign of hate and fear against homosexuals. It is a deeply personal story of torment and triumph, as well as a frightening examination of the anti-homosexual tactics of the religious right and a prophetic look at where they might lead our nation. Both aut</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>White, a former ghostwriter for such prominent Christian conservatives as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Oliver North, details in this melodramatic, sentimental but absorbing autobiography his own troubling, yet ultimately empowering acknowledgement of his homosexuality. White's account of his futile attempts to deny or ``cure'' his desires--through life as a husband and father, through prayer and self-denial, even through shock therapy--is affecting if overdrawn; more interesting is his success in finally reconciling his faith with his sexuality. Such a reconciliation rested in part upon White's recognition that only through distorting the Bible can one find prohibitions against homosexuality there. That White himself, while still closeted and struggling, worked for those most responsible for perpetuating such disinformation is one of the more pungent ironies in the book; it is startling to read that Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell's agitprop denunciation of ``perverts'' purportedly overrode his nobler impulses towards tolerance and compassion.

Showing what has gone wrong between the sexes, it reveals a whole new history of intimate relations - and how these affect and are in turn affected by all our relations, whether in the public or private sphere. It charts our course from prehistory, when sex was a celebrated mystery linked to all that is sacred, through the invasion of Europe by nomadic warriors, when sex became a means of domination, to the earliest Western civilizations, the reign of the church, and into our time of culture wars - when women and men all over the world are searching for new ways of living and loving. Along the way, it looks at the economics and politics of sexual and other intimate relations, the modern revolution in consciousness, the epidemic of AIDS, the failure of traditional morality, and the emerging new ethics for sex and spirituality.",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.95 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/33/9780062502933.jpg,Success,123.0,17.6

And yet fetishism, one of the most intriguing and mysterious forms of sexual expression, is still cast as an almost exclusively male domain. Most psychoanalytic thought, for instance, excludes the very possibility of female fetishism.<p> <p>The first book on the subject, <i>Female Fetishism</i> engagingly documents women's involvement in this form of sexuality. Lorraine Gamman and Merja Makinen describe a wide array of female fetishisms, from the obsessional behavior of pop fans (and pop performers such as Madonna) to fetishism in advertising to women's involvement in the world of dress clubs and fetish magazines. The authors provide provocative evidence of food fetishism among women, arguing that many eating disorders are best understood from this perspective.<br>A latter portion of the book includes a discussion of how feminists have treated the political and cultural significance of female fetishism.<p></p>",en,Later Printing,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.62 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches",27.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/20/9780814730720.jpg,Success,106.0,17.6

Six years later, she, W.E.B. DuBois, and 50 others founded the NAACP. Their goals included ending racial discrimination and segregation, and achieving full civil and legal rights for African-Americans-a dream that is still alive today, along with the organization they founded.</p>
<p>Ovington's candid memoir reveals a corageous woman who defied the social restrictions placed on women of her generation, race, and class, nd became part of an inner circle that made the decisions for the NAACP in its first forty years. Her actions often brought unwelcome notoriety-as wehn lurid newspaper headlines announced her attendance at a biracial dinner in 1908-yet she continued working side-by-side with such colleagues as DuBois, James Wheldon Johnson, amd Walter White, and began travelling across the country to help establish NAACP chapters in the deep south, the Midwest, and California.</p>
<p>Serialized in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper in 1932 and 1933, Ovington's memoirs are here available for the first time in book form. Black and White Sat Down Together offers an insider's view of a seminal phase in the struggle for civil rights, and a moving encounter with a woman who was hailed in her time as a ""fighting saint.""</p>

The issues of gay and lesbian identity represented by this question are explored for the first time in the context of Spanish and Hispanic literature in this groundbreaking anthology.<br>
Combining intimate knowledge of Spanish-speaking cultures with contemporary queer theory, these essays address texts that share both a common language and a concern with lesbian, gay, and bisexual identities. Using a variety of approaches, the contributors tease the homoerotic messages out of a wide range of works, from chronicles of colonization in the Caribbean to recent Puerto Rican writing, from the work of Cervantes to that of the most outrageous contemporary Latina performance artists. This volume offers a methodology for examining work by authors and artists whose sexuality is not so much open as ""an open secret,"" respecting, for example, the biographical privacy of writers like Gabriela Mistral while responding to the voices that speak in their writing. Contributing to an archeology of queer discourses, <i>¿Entiendes?</i> also includes important studies of terminology and encoded homosexuality in Argentine literature and Caribbean journalism of the late nineteenth century.<br>

Evidence for the role of homosexuality in artistic creation has often not survived, in part because the direct expression of homosexuality has often been condemned in Western societies. Gay and Lesbian Studies in Art History presents examples of contemporary art historical research on homoeroticism and homosexuality in the visual arts (chiefly painting and sculpture) of the Western tradition from the ancient to the modern periods. Chapters explore the dynamic interrelation of sexuality and visual art and emphasize problems of historical evidence and interpretation and the need to reconstruct social and cultural realities sometimes quite different from our own.
<p>Gay and Lesbian Studies in Art History addresses contemporary art historians’interest in studying sexuality in the visual arts, examining such questions as: What are some of the present-day reasons for, and problems of, this research? How is it related to other research areas within art history and to wider public debates about the meaning, value, and propriety of works of art? While the book examines a variety of research problems and theoretical perspectives, most chapters focus on the historical interpretation of a particular work of art, artist, or visual convention. Chapters present new documentation of the importance of homosexuality in the production and reception of artworks in the Western tradition, develop models for approaching the question of how sexuality and visual creation are related, and explore researchers’experiences and obligations in working in the area of gay and lesbian studies in art history today.</p>
<p>Contributing authors stress problems of historical evidence and reconstruction; the social and cultural construction of homosexuality; and the active role of visual conventions in shaping perceptions of homosexuals, homosexuality, and homosexual desire. They discuss both the biography of artists and the significance of individual works of art and the social reception and circulation of works of art in the context of wider religious, legal, medical, political, and economic relations. The book may revise readers’beliefs about the significance and value of a number of works of art hitherto forgotten, neglected, under-appreciated, or misinterpreted. Gay and Lesbian Studies in Art History is an enlightening and informative book for art historians, museum professionals, scholars in the field of lesbian and gay studies, and art history students and professors.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.43 Inches, Length: 6.08 Inches, Weight: 1.09790206476 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/40/9781560230540.jpg,Success,63.0,17.6

Together they represent a great, untapped economic resource, a resource no other country in the world can claim. This is America's competitive secret, argues Judy B. Rosener in this refreshingly pragmatic new book for managers who want to improve their bottom line.<br>
 A leading expert on women and men at work and a highly sought-after speaker, Rosener argues that not only are men and women different, so are male and female managers. Drawing on in-depth interviews with top-flight executives and middle managers and the latest research on working women and organizational change, she describes the unique contribution of female professionals. Her profiles of top women managers reveal that they cope well with ambiguity, are comfortable sharing power, and they tend to empower others— leadership traits that Rosener contends lead to increased employee productivity, innovation, and profits. As businesses today struggle with corporate reorganization and an increasingly diverse workforce, <b>America's Competive Secret</b> offers compelling evidence that the changes that help organizatiions more fully utilize the talents of women are the same changes that will give them an important edge in today's fast-changing, service oriented, global workplace.<br>
 Rosener explains why the so-called glass ceiling still prevents many competent women from reaching the upper echelons of management. She analyzes why women and men are perceived and evaluated differently at work, and provides new insight into the feelings of men who are asked to interact with women in new roles when there are few new rules. Rosener shows that removing the glass ceiling can no longer be viewed solely in terms of social equity—it is now an economic imperative.<br>
 Too many American businesses have limited their economic strength by viewing the promotion of women employees only within the context of federally mandated affirmative action laws and policies. <b>America's Competitive Secret</b> redefines the issue for a new era, showing that America's most successful competitive strategy is one that most effectively utilizes <b>all</b> its human resources.</p>

<p>It's the Hollywood of the future, where moviemaking's been computerized and live-action films are a thing of the past. It's a Hollywood where Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe are starring together in A Star Is Born, and if you don't like the ending, you can change it with the stroke of a key.</p>
<p>A Hollywood of warmbodies and sim-sex, of drugs and special effects, where anything is possible. Except for what one starry-eyed young woman wants to do: dance in the movies. It's an impossible dream, but Alis is not willing to give up. With a little magic and a lot of luck, she just might get her happy ending after all.</p>

As both child and adult, Blanca was abused by both people and the economic system the creates the meanest, most violent ghettoes. In Bianca, Ambert explores how oppression breeds violence and entraps people, even after they escape poverty and become successful. Once Bianca breaks out of the ghetto, she is not free; there is a severe emotional price to pay. She suffers the pain of living between two cultures, two languages, two ways of perceiving the world; she is caught in the emotional limbo of a dual identity.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Poet and short-story writer Ambert's first novel chronicles the harrowing tale of a young woman pulled unwillingly through life in New York's South Bronx. Blanca battles poverty, abuse and despair, but her toughest confrontation is with her own memories. ``The memory is not clear, but reeks of an atavistic sadness, passive for centuries,'' she muses. ``Atavistic sadness'' might suggest the novel is a statement on the Puerto Rican people, in which case it might have resonated. But the events of one young woman's life are doled out relentlessly to the reader like so many strikes of a hammer. The novel begins with Blanca's most recent suicide attempt-her way of fighting the persistent oppression of recollection. Yet, although the story is written partly in the first person and recounts many of Blanca's abysmal experiences, it circles around reflection without defining the core of the problem. One feels that the author is trying hard but unsuccessfully to expose a devastating truth in these pages, but the suffocating atmosphere of this relentlessly depressing story traps the reader inside Blanca's ``dark pain'' without catharsis or surcease.

There was a time when fairy tales weren't meant just for children — they were part of an oral folklore tradition passed down through generations. This volume of sixty enchanting and enduring tales, collected by master storyteller Angela Carter, revives the industry, eccentricity, spirit, and worldly wisdom of women in preindustrial times. Drawn from narrative traditions all around the world — from ancient Swahili legends to Appalachian tall tales to European spirit stories and more — these tales together comprise a unique feminine mythology.<br>

Pier Paolo Pasolini was a driven man: uncompromising, many-talented, homosexual, at once anti-Fascist and anti-Communist, anti-clerical and profoundly religious. He was - in one fervent lifetime - a poet and novelist (The Ragazzi, A Violent Life), cultural critic, political polemicist, and filmmaker (The Gospel According to Matthew, Theorem, Decameron, and his last, desperate legacy, Salo). Informed by research into the murder of the man and the making of his myth, Pasolini Requiem gives a powerful account of the life and art of its subject, a crucial figure immersed in every social and cultural conflict of his time. Witness and protagonist, Pasolini was born the year Mussolini came to power (1922) and died when the Italian Communist Party almost achieved it (1975). His crowded fifty-three years saw him repeatedly charged with obscenity and even ""damaging the religion of the State."" Always acquitted, he always scandalized.

Experts tell us who these women are and why they break the law, usually igonroing of discrediting the opinions of the women themselves.</p><p>As a counselling and research intern in a women's medium-security prison, Evelyn K. Sommers heard the stories of dozens of women inmates who came for counselling. Their crimes were related to prostitution, drug abuse, theft, physical abuse, assault, and arson. Most of the women had been imprisoned several times before. Their stories called into question existing theoretical explanations for criminal behaviour as well as the explanations commonly heard in the day-to-day discourse of the prison. Sommers came to the conclusion that attempts to help women in conflict with the law can be effective only if they take into account the women's understanding of what happened to them in the course of their lifetime. She resolved to conduct intensive interviewa with fourteen women and to find the common threads in their stories, threads that might prove useful in furthering our understanding of women's conflicts with the law.</p><p>Sommers presents the women's accounts of their actions, thoughts, and feelings, without excusing, condemning them, and without moulding their explanations for their behaviour to some ideological model. Four common reasons or themes emergedfrom the women's accounts: need; disconnection and the influence of others, visible anger; and fear. Further analysis uncovered two implicit underlying themes that were present in all of the women's stories; namely, the centrality of relationships in their lives and their personal quest for empowerment. Voices from Within demonstrates the importance of conducting separate studies of male and female lawbreakers including women as a focus of study; of relying on subjective perspectives to distinguish amd appropriately address differences inherent in the criminal population; and of reconceptualizing of the notion of motivation. Sommers concludes with suggestions for further research, and for practical approaches to working with lawbreakers.</p>",en,2nd ed.,"Height: 8.99 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.6393405598 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/92/9780802074492.jpg,Success,112.0,17.6

While no book can replace the directly received Reiki &#147;attunements,&#148; ESSENTIAL REIKI provides everything else that the healer, practitioner, and teacher of this system needs.</p>",en,1,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.53 Inches, Weight: 0.95019234922 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",19.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/69/9780895947369.jpg,Success,33.0,17.6

Edited by Hill and Emma Coleman Jordan, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and including the first published essay on the episode written by Hill herself, these essays explore the volatile politics of race and gender, and the unique challenges faced by African-American women.<br>
 Among the distinguished contributors are Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton; playwright/actress and Stanford University Professor Anna Deaveare Smith; and Chief Judge Emeritus A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, this collection brings together for the first time many of the direct participants in the hearings, including four members of Hill's emergency legal team: Professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. of Harvard Law School; Professor Judith Resnik of the University of Southern California Law Center; Susan Deller Ross, Director of the Sex Discrimination Clinic at Georgetown Law Center; and volume co-editor Emma Coleman Jordan. Jordan's essay examines how Thomas used the ""lynching"" metaphor to evoke a false racial memory of innocent black victims of vigilante violence. The lynching metaphor succeeded in branding Hill as a race-disrespecting traitor who was willing to ""air the dirty linen"" of sexual misconduct by breaking a powerful racial taboo against exposing black men to flawed justice. In ""She's No Lady; She's a Nigger,"" Adele Logan Alexander scrutinizes the devastating, centuries-old stereotypes of African-American women as mindless, untrustworthy, and sexually insatiable. Hill examines the institutions of patronage and marriage, demonstrating how, as a professional African-American woman with no official Senate sponsor, she confounded the assumptions by which lawmakers are accustomed to assigning credibility and status. ""In going before the Committee, I came face to face with a history of exclusion from power,"" she writes. Charles R. Lawrence views the controversy as Act One in a three act morality play starring Clarence Thomas, William Kennedy Smith, and Mike Tyson, and Harvard's Orlando Patterson maintains that it is black men, even more than black women, who suffer the consequences of strained gender relations. Looking to the future, Robert L. Allen describes his encouraging work with the Oakland Men's Project, and offers a prescription for ending sexual harassment and the system of sexism that underpins it.<br>
 <b>Race, Gender, and Power in America</b> is provocative reading for everyone concerned about the fault lines of race and gender threatening to rupture our society.</p>

You will have to be better than most, not just as good as.'' He also adds that in ``becoming humorless we lose connection to the most vital parts of our culture.'' In this collection of nine essays (taken from addresses and articles), two lukewarm poems, a play and a moving prayer, he proves the validity of his own maxims. The initial essay, ``Notes About TheaterMy STUMP Speech,'' is terrific: his riff on the political and the personal, the theater of the ridiculous and the theater of the fabulous, synthesizes humor and commitment into wisdom. But the further Kushner's writings get from the personal, and the closer they get to the political, the less interesting they are. None of his pieces is exactly tightly argued, but his politics taken neat are a loose conglomeration of familiar rhetoric generally lacking an individual imprint. His most cogently argued position is that gay liberation must be linked to a fight against oppression of any stripe. Less convincing is his screed against the Gulf war, of which he says, ``No single event during the course of my lifetime [Kushner was born in 1956], nothing that I can remember has occasioned such depression and despair as has the Gulf War.'' The play, a funny, insightful piece set in post-glasnost Russia, explores an ultimate crisis of faith, and in one of its best scenes, the old revolutionary Aleksii Antedilluvianovich Prelapsarianov exclaims ``For ninety years I have wondered... WHY is the Good Cause always defeated by the Bad.... Because God... is a Menshevik!''

The feminist scholar Sharon Thompson first began to listen to teenage girls' tales about their sexual and romantic experiences in the late 1970s, soon after they had gained the right to contraception. For almost ten years, she interviewed girls across the country, in shopping malls and pizza parlors, under highway trestles and in public parks. Her brilliant and moving account of what she heard captures teenage girls' first startled responses to the radically new rules of sex and romance and their efforts to shape new ways of being sexual out of such long-standing adolescent preoccupations as popularity, alienation, and best-friendship. In her interpretation, Thompson begins to make sense of many aspects of teenage sexual behavior that survey research has failed to explain: the persistent, exasperating discrepancies, for example, between what teenagers know and what they do - discrepancies that are more critical than ever, given the danger of AIDS.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.75 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",24.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/15/9780809050215.jpg,Success,118.0,17.6

Gold's charming and insightful portrait of the colorful and controversial poet reconstructs her life [and] re-creates life in Juticalpa at the turn of the century, focusing on factors that shaped Clementina's mind and outlook and led her to create her poetry.""—Nora Erro-Peralta, Florida Atlantic University</p>
<p>""Masterful storytelling. . . . I found myself riveted to the pages, eager to learn more about Suárez's life. . . . Within the first pages of the prologue, the reader feels included in this very private world.&nbsp; One of the greatest merits of the text is Gold's own prose, elegant and poetic in its own right.""—Nancy Saporta Sternbach, Smith College</p>
<p>Clementina Suárez (1902-91), the legendary matriarch of Honduran letters, scandalized Central American society with her bohemian lifestyle, her passionate woman-centered poetry, and her dedicated and unconventional promotion of art and literature.<br>
 &nbsp;This first biography of the notorious poet follows her life from the family home in an isolated rural province of Honduras to New York, Mexico, Cuba, and El Salvador, placing her in the company of some of the major figures of twentieth-century Latin American cultural and political life.<br>
 &nbsp;Using layers of rich sources—interviews with Suárez and her daughters and sisters conducted during a year's stay in Honduras, recollections and written tributes of friends and artists, and archival material from public and private collections in Central America—Janet Gold weaves together the story of a writer who stubbornly chose to live as she pleased, with a well-balanced discussion of the social and cultural climate of twentieth-century Central America.&nbsp; In Gold's words, she paints a portrait of ""haciendas and cantinas, mule trips to Tegucigalpa, and poetry recitals in the National Theatre. . . . posing for Diego Rivera, partying with Pablo Neruda and Miguel Angel Asturias, writing poems about sexuality and political commitment.""<br>
 &nbsp;In the Honduran psyche, Suárez has played the roles of liberated woman, fallen woman, femme fatale, prostitute, broken-hearted lover, muse, revolutionary poet, and respected woman of letters.&nbsp; The process of reconciling the conflicting stories about Suárez with her personal response to this extraordinary woman enriched Gold's task as a feminist biographer and led her to examine and appreciate the complex nature of ""life writing.""&nbsp; The result is this portrait of a woman poet that brings to life the person yet leaves the legend intact.&nbsp;</p>

0-19-509556-1,Feminism & Bioethics: Beyond Reproduction,,Oxford University Press,416.0,1996-04-11,,Paperback,"<p><P>Bioethics has paid surprisingly little attention to the special problems faced by women and to feminist analyses of current health care issues other than reproduction. <b>Feminism & Bioethics&#58; Beyond Reproduction</b> aims to counterbalance this one-sided approach. A breakthrough volume of original essays authored by leading figures in bioethics and feminist theory, it moves beyond reproduction and nursing, taking bioethics into new territory. The book starts with an investigation of the relationship between feminism and bioethics and introduces different approaches to the problem. Chapters stress the importance of liberal feminism which prefers feminist over feminine analysis, integrate the experience of women of color, draw from the women's self-help movement, and apply feminist standpoint theory. In the second part of the book, contributors view various bioethical problems from a feminist perspective&#58; euthanasia, AIDS, the definition of health, doctor-patient communication, the Human Genome Project, the conduct of biomedical research, and health care reform. They examine the pros and cons of the application of gender and feminism to bioethics. This provocative volume is bound to change and broaden the way bioethicists, students, patients, and the public consider bioethical issues.</p> <h3>Diane M. Kondratowicz</h3> <p>This is a collection of 12 original essays written by noted scholars representative of a variety of academic disciplines and professional backgrounds. ""This work is intended to fill a void in the scholarly literature concerning a subject that, the editor notes, has long and unfortunately been overlooked. Focusing on the important role gender plays in healthcare, contributors explore what feminism might contribute to bioethics. ""This work is intended primarily for scholars in medical ethics and women's studies. The content and format of the book would also lend itself well to academic instruction. ""The book is divided into two sections. Section I, consisting of five essays, addresses the relationship between feminism and bioethics. Section II, consisting of seven essays, discusses a range of specific healthcare issues in relation to women and feminism. Essay topics include a feminist conception of health, communication in the physician-patient relationship, justice in the context of healthcare resources, genetics, euthanasia, biomedical research, and the HIV epidemic. ""Authors contributing to this collection present thoughtful, compelling, and intriguing arguments well deserving of critical attention. By means of introduction, for example, the editor explores the many reasons, inherent in the discipline of bioethics itself, why the subject at hand has long been overlooked. In Section I contributors validate the experiences, interests, and insights of women and offer a number of innovative ideas concerning how their perspectives might be incorporated into healthcare practice (e.g., feminist standpoint theory). Focusing on specific healthcare issues, contributors in Section IIreinforce the importance of gender and the necessity for the inclusion of feminist perspectives in bioethics. Overall, this work does well in filling the void identified by the editor and, as such, makes a worthwhile and important contribution to the scholarly literature.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.15 Inches, Weight: 1.3007273458 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches",37.63,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/62/9780195095562.jpg,Success,107.0,17.6

Evelyn Bassof, Ph.D</p> <h3>BookList</h3> <p>Unlike most guides for new mothers, which focus on practical skills for daily care of infants, this one emphasizes the necessary emotional and psychological transformation required for a woman to become a mother. Psychotherapist Leonhardt-Lupa explores the impact of her own mothering, changes in self-identity, unreasonable expectations for motherhood, and changes in sexuality and the body to help women prepare for the challenges of mothering a new baby. A lengthy case study reinforces her insights. Although Leonhardt-Lupa writes with warmth, she is unflinching in presenting the negative and painful aspects of first-time motherhood, and in the process, she provides unusual and effective reality checks for women who have chosen to assume this responsibility.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125972 Inches, Weight: 0.62611282408 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches",25.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/34/9780897893534.jpg,Success,119.0,17.6
