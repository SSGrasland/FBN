Surprise & Support
Charis’ new year started with a monetary gift
from ALFA, the Atlanta Lesbian Feminist Alliance.
“It feels important to us to acknowledge [ALFA] pub-
licly for this gift and what it symbolizes to us,” Charis
women wrote in Southern Voice recently. “For the
first 20 years of our work, we were supported loving-
ly by members and friends of ALFA — in fact, much
of what we now recognize as our community grew
from the work that ALFA did so consistently in the
world. When there was nowhere to go to hear the
word lesbian spoken with honor, when women were
just beginning to find one another in Atlanta, when
Charis was just a babe, there was ALFA. From ALFA
came dances, concerts, meetings, political action, end-
less processing resulting in firm convictions, and
pride. When Saralyn Chesnut and Amanda Gable Rose Fennel contemplates enormous changes in interior design.
present their oral history of the beginnings of Charis
and of that period, ALFA is a significant part of the
story that women tell about their lives. So now there
is no official ALFA and in the pain of that transition,
the women of ALFA have acted with grace and love
and honor. We are touched and proud to be the recip-
ient of some of the final disbursement of funds from
ALFA. The spirit of ALFA is interwoven in the ongo-
ing work of Charis, the commitment to lesbian visibil-
ity, the preservation and promotion of books and
periodicals by and about lesbians, the creation of safe
space for women. Thank you ALFA for your good
money to lessen our renovation debt, and for your
ongoing support in the years to come.”

that we called Backbone.
In 1977, when I was twenty-six, a year after “Is it a feminist press?” June Arnold barked. She
Rachel da Silva and I had started Seal Press, I went was Wearing a cotton shirt and bell bottom jeans
to a two-week-long women writers workshop in
upstate New York. I'm sorry to say I did no writing
at all during that workshop, preferring instead to
row dreamily around on the lake with a beautiful
young married woman from Atlanta. However, I
did meet June Arnold there and the conversation I
had with her was one of those that changed my life.
Nowadays, if you say June Arnold’s name, only a
„handful of people will remember who she was;
though since Sister Gin has been reprinted by the
Feminist Press, perhaps that has changed a little.
But to some of us then, June Arnold was a leg-
endary figure: the founder of Daughters, Inc., one
of the first of the feminist presses, the discoverer
and editor of Rita Mae Brown, and a wonderful les-
bian author in her own right.
June Arnold died in 1982 — of a brain tumor.
Even if she were alive today she would not remem-
ber me. I was awestruck and shy; further, I was dis-
turbed by homesickness, the humidity (something
we did not have on the West Coast) and my feel-
ings for Mrs. Atlanta. But in spite of my shyness, I
managed to tell June Arnold that Í had helped start
a letterpress publishing company the year before in
Seattle. We had printed one poetry book by hand Photo by N. Walz
and were laboriously printing the second — an Barbara starts up the letterpress in October, 1977.

AN EXCITING NEW LESBFAN=V OI CES FROM
ALYSON
ECS
a novel by Louise A. Blum
Maura Jaeger has hidden herself in the hills of rural Pennsyl-
vania, teaching English at a small state college and rigorously
avoiding all relationships. When her father dies, she must
return to the small town where she grew up, confronting
ghosts at every turn: her beloved brother Colin, whose tour of
duty in Vietnam changed him forever; the town that shunned
her family when her brother Zach fled to Canada to dodge
the draft; the lovers who left her behind; and the
family that has exiled her for her lesbianism. Forced to
re-examine the childhood that she has fought so hard to
forget, Maura must grant herself her own amnesty, and begin
to live her life on her own terms.
“A powerful story, beautifully written ... Don't miss the auspicious debut of this important and gifted new novelist.”
—Katherine V. Forrest, author of Flashpoint
“Louise A. Blum’s writing voice is heartstopping and beautiful — deep and sad as a tolling bell ... This is an exception-
ally well crafted novel, a look at another consequence of the Viet Nam war.”
—Judith Katz, author of Running Fiercely toward a High Thin Sound
“Louise Blum’s terse prose is perfect for this hauntingly painful story ... Once I entered Maura’s world, I couldn't leave
-I read the entire novel in one sitting, letting myself feel the terror, sadness, and joy, as tears ran down my face.”
—Karen Kahn, editor of Sojourner

Reimagining God
The Case for Scriptural Diversity
Johanna W. H. van Wijk-Bos Paper $12.99 March
“‘Reimagining’ is a crucial and indispensable interpretive practice already
at work in the Bible itself. Bos shows herself not only to be in the middle
of the conversation concerning how God will be respoken, she demon-
strates in this thoughtful and careful discussion how to do it, why it must
be done, and what an enormous difference it makes.” — Walter

Sara Hansen, a New York lesbian and a doctor, journeys to the
Amazon jungle to research a plant that helps boost the immune
system. While hiking up the bank of an Amazon tributary, she is
wounded in a hunting accident and a matriarchal tribe encounters
their first Westerner. Tribal leadership rivalry, Sara learning rituals

the most healing place, her own house. In the meantime, ex-partner Mavis is busy

to widen her horizons, to continue their love as loyal friendship. Then Laura meets

And so Helen journeys from Berkeley, from partner Frieda, to return to her roots in
Mississippi, To look once more into the face of the father who repudiated her. Into the
face of the woman who was her childhood sweetheart and is now a cop.

This compelling collection of essays, stories, poems, and
artwork investigates with clarity, humor, courage,
and sometimes pain,
the dual issues of feminism and motherhood.
“Here feminist mothers write about. abortion, infertility,
miscarriages, the death of children. They also write about
the sensual joys of mothering, the intellectual joy of
discovering another person’s growth, and ultimately the
joy of claiming identities as women with choices.”
~ The Editors
