Fusion Marketing
By Laurel Hastings
ClaireLight/Santa Rosa CA
A feminist bookstore is always more than a
bookstore. It’s a source of inspiration and a meeting
place for like minds. Unfortunately, feminist book-
stores often operate with little cash flow. Many
independent bookstores have faded away over the
last ten years and are being upstaged by the “super-
stores.” Knowing how to fuse seemingly dissimilar
products and how to keep the romance of book-
stores alive is now a marketing strategy worth not-
ing. Imagination and creative marketing are of cru-
cial importance. Offering a good product for a fair
price is no longer a ticket to success.
My bookstore carries the usual feminist book-
store assortment of cards, music, journals, wrapping
paper, candles and the like. One of our favorite chal-
lenges is to find products in the store that have con-
nections. Customers particularly appreciate our
efforts in this direction when they are trying to put From left to right: Earth Healer, Goddess Primordiac and

There are many types of books available. One of my
favorites to use in connection with the jewelry is The

Edwards. The stories are vividly written and full of
color and life. The Kuan Yin story in Edwards’ book
ties in with Iris’ Kuan Yin piece. Jean Shinoda
Bolen’s Goddesses in Everywoman (Harper) shows
readers how to identify their ruling goddesses and
includes a basic “who's who in Greek mythology.”

seem to love finding something exotic and beautiful

This is fusion marketing: grouping seemingly unre-

requires just a little planning, a little enthusiasm
and gets some great results.

1995 Dykes To Watch Out For Calendar
Cartoons by Alison Bechdel
Å scene straight out of the suburban mall, Alison Bechdel’s Dykes To Watch Out For
1995 Calendar flashes a mug shot of the lesbian community’s best-known family.
In its sixth year of helping lesbians keep track of who’s who and what’s happening, this
annual cartoon opportunity brings it all into sharp focus. Casual glances, intense gazes,
and penetrating looks from lesbians we have grown to love all meet the cartoonisť’s eye.
You never know who you'll see on an outing to the mall. Irresistible— like the women
in your life.
