Norma Field, the daughter of a Japanese woman and an American G.I., and author of the acclaimed <i><br>
In the Realm of a Dying Emperor</i>, returned to Japan in 1995 to tend to her slowly dying grandmother, who had been rendered speechless by multiple strokes. What she finds—both in the memories of her childhood in her grandmother's household and in the altered face of postmodern Japan—forms the substance of her narrative that transcends both memoir and essay to reveal, through crafted fragments, a refraction of the whole of Japan.<br>
Having spent her childhood in Japan and her adulthood in the United States, Field speaks from the position of one who straddles two worlds. Her testimony is highly personal, her voice is intimate, her observations are keen and clear. She juxtaposes details from daily life—conversations overheard on the subway; arguments between her mother and aunts; the struggle to feed, bathe, and care for her grandmother—with observations on the political and social changes that have transformed Japan. She shows how the belated coming to terms with the war and continuing avoidance of the same are intimately related to the look and feel of Japanese society today. She gently folds back the complicated layers of blame and responsibility for the war, touching in the process on subjects as diverse as the effects of the atomic bomb, comfort women, biracial/bicultural families, the farewells of Kamikaze pilots, and the dehumanizing effects of Japan's postwar economic boom. A recurrent theme is the observation of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the war.<br>
<i>From My Grandmother's Bedside</i> is also a contemplation of the many facets of language: the kinds of language with which her grandmother's illness has been negotiated, the wordless language her grandmother speaks, her own relationship to these languages. Through it all runs the realization that the personal and the political are perpetually entangled, that past and present converge and overlap.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.14109584768 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",85,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/45/9780520208445.jpg,Success,137,21.1

Her last play was a flop and her financial situation is getting desperate: she's in debt to a moneylender who could have her arrested for nonpayment at any time. When she casts the Earl of Rochester's mistress, Elizabeth Decker, as the lead in her new comedy, she deeply regrets it. Lord Rochester has bet the Duke of Buckingham that he can turn the theatrically challenged Elizabeth into the best actress on the London stage, and he's offered to cut Aphra in on his winnings. But there are other more dangerous matters afoot, and when Aphra offers to organize the funeral of a murdered man it seems her troubles are only just beginning. The deaths of two brothers turn out to be linked to the discovery of a secret document which could - unless Aphra moves quickly - plunge England into another civil war.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/85/9780312185985.jpg,Success,81,21.1

Although Lessing is difficult to categorize, her work is always concerned with a search for something new against the nightmare repetition of history. Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook, together with such works as The Second Sex and The Feminine Mystique, raised the consciousness of a generation of women readers and played a major part in engendering the second wave of feminism.

0-8050-3650-4,N is for Noose,"Grafton, Sue",Henry Holt,289,5/15/1998,,Hardcover,"<p>""When I first wrote <i>Alibi</i>, Grafton is quoted as saying, ""I was just trying to get it done. I certainly wasn't thinking about a series."" With that profound statement hovering somewhere in her past, Sue Grafton now offers her fourteenth novel in the popular Alphabet Mystery series. <i>""N"" Is for Noose</i> finds Kinsey investigating the mysterious death of Nota Lake sheriff Tom Newquist. But when it becomes clear that the strange town has some very dark secrets, Kinsey realizes that if she's not careful, she could be the victim of the town's next crime.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The noose of the title implies a tight knot, but the twists and turns of Grafton's latest plot are pretty loose. Not that the fans of self-reliant PI Kinsey Millhone's 13 previous alphabet appearances (from 1982's <i>A Is for Alibi</i> through 1996's <i>M Is for Malice</i>) are likely to object. This story takes Kinsey away from her Southern California coastal town of Santa Teresa to the small mountain community of Nota Lake in the Sierras. There, Selma Newquist hires Kinsey to ferret out the problem that had been seriously bothering her cop husband, Tom, before his recent death from a heart attack. Kinsey's efforts are soon stonewalled as the residents of Nota Lake unite, suggesting that the widow is being troublesome while the good-guy cop should be left to rest in peace. Kinsey wonders whether the townspeople might be right until she is seriously beaten up in her Nota Lake motel room. Focusing on finding the dead man's missing notebook, she follows his trail to a seedy hotel not far from Santa Teresa that he visited a few weeks before his death. While keeping a suspicious eye on the dead man's police partner and a few other local figures, Kinsey determines that Tom Newquist had been investigating an old murder near Nota Lake, which may have had ties to a similar, recent murder. Lots of coincidences, some over-the top characters, including a hyper-raunchy older woman, and some unprepared-for elements contribute to the rather chaotic climax. But Grafton's easy-reading, intelligent prose and her heroine's sharp humor, served up dark and wry, make up for a slew of plot weaknesses. Mystery Guild main selection; Literary Guild selection.

0-8014-8520-7,Women in Old Norse Society,"Jochens, Jenny",Cornell University Press,288,3/26/1998,,Perfect Paperback,"<p>Jenny Jochens captures in fascinating detail the lives of women in pagan and early Christian Iceland and Norway - their work, sexual behavior, marriage customs, reproductive practices, familial relations, leisure activities, religious practices, and legal constraints and protections. Much of this information also applies to everyday life in the entire Germanic world. Conveying the experiences not only of aristocrats but also of ordinary farmers, the author draws from her extensive knowledge of the oldest and fullest record of the Germanic tribes. Women in Old Norse Society places particular emphasis on changing sexual mores and the impact of the imposition of Christianity by the clergy and the Norwegian kings. It also demonstrates the vital role women played in economic production: homespun was used for every conceivable domestic purpose; the lengths of cloth became the standard of measurement for local commercial exchange and were used to obtain commodities abroad. Jochens's masterly command of the Old Norse narratives and legal texts enables her to provide a rich social history that includes the fullest analysis to date of pagan and Christian marriage and the first comprehensive study of infanticide in the North.</p><h3>Booknews</h3><p>A detailed study of the lives of Christian and Pagan Norse women, teasing out from predominantly male narratives, oral histories, and legal tracts, the vital role women played in the society and the changes imposed on them by Christianity. Jochens (history, Towson State U.) outlines pagan and Christian marriages, divorce and widowhood, sexuality and reproductive issues such as infanticide and royal succession, leisure activities, work, and the economics of cloth making.

She's A Photographer Who Has Been Attempting For Three Years To Photograph A World-renowned Reproductive Surgeon/comedian Who Can't Sit Still Long Enough For His Picture To Be Taken. Her Other Projects Include Photographing Anne Sexton's Childhood Home And Walden Pond. Along The Way She Keeps Searching For Some Sign Of Sanity And Order Amid The Mediocrity, Waste, Pointlessness, Vulgarity, Junk Food, And Tv Programs Of Contemporary America. She's An Astute Observer Of Modern Life's Strange Complexities - Windows That Don't Open, The Footwear Of Endodontists, And Husbands Who Don't Talk - And At The Same Time She's Hilariously And Poignantly Caught Up In Them. The Decline Of Our Culture And Everyday Decency Are Brought Into Sharp Focus By This Unique, Besieged Sensibility, As Is The Beauty Of Vegetarianism, The Use Of Mozart For Transcending Root-canal Therapy, And The Heartache Of Floor Refinishing And Fluorescent Lighting. In Do The Windows Open? Julie Hecht, With Her Distinctive Voice And Wry Humor, Has Given Us A Tragi-comedy Of Missed Connections And Opportunities, Vividly Illuminating The Way We Live Now.</p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>it's Surprising That Hecht, A Longtime Contributor To The New Yorker And A Winner Of The O. Henry Prize, Hasn't Published A Book Before This. These Nine Stories Are All Narrated By The Same Bracingly Neurotic Heroine, A 40-ish Photographer Named Isabelle Who Has A Lot To Say On Virtually Everything From The Intricacies Of Macrobiotic Cooking To Whether Or Not Her Optician Is Or Was A Nazi, The Son Of Nazis, A Neo-nazi Or, At The Very Least, A Nazi Sympathizer. When She's Not Working On Her Idiosyncratic Photo-essays (flowers In Decline, Reproductive Surgeons And Their Dogs), Isabelle Spends An Inordinate Amount Of Time Chasing Down Objects Essential For Her Daily Life, Like Organic Vegetables And Reversible Alpaca Coats From England. Meanwhile, She Keeps Up A Barrage Of Exceedingly Manic Diatribes On Such Pressing Subjects As The Greenhouse Effect, The Passage Of Time And How Annoying Swedish People Can Be-all Expressed In Borderline Hysterical, Impeccably Crisp Diction, Like Miss Manners With The Wrong Prescription. The Best Of These Stories Are Hilariously Funny, Filled With The Horrors Of Modern Life (bad Architecture, Traffic Jams, The Smell Of Peanuts On The Bus) And Wacky Exchanges With Her Loudmouthed Reproductive Surgeon, Dr. Loquesto, Her Careless Floor Sander, The Guy At The Discount Drugs Or Her Neighbors In Nantucket And East Hampton. Some Of The Stories May Remind The Reader Of A Long Phone Conversation With A Batty, Obsessed Neighbor Who Doesn't Know When To Hang Up. You May Breathe A Little Sigh Of Relief When They're Over-but Then Again, Her Point Of View Is So Entertaining, You Can't Wait For Her To Call Back.

Author of many books, both fiction and non-fiction, which challenge our thinking about the politics of sex, Third World development, the Arab world and writing itself, she has been a constant thorn in the side of the class and patriarchal systems.<p>This collection of her non-fiction writing since the publication of her seminal book on Arab women <i>The Hidden Face of Eve</i> (Zed Books, 1980) presents the full range of her extraordinary work. She explores a host of topics from women&#8217;s oppression at the hands of recent interpretations of Islam to the role of women in African literature, from the sexual politics of development initiatives to tourism in a &#8216;post-colonial&#8217;age, from the nature of cultural identity to the subversive potential of creativity, from the fight against female genital mutilation to problems facing the internationalization of the women&#8217;s movement. Throughout her writing, she sheds new light on the power of women in resistance - against poverty, racism, fundamentalism, and inequality of all kinds.<p>Showing the intellectual and political development of an important thinker for the late twentieth century, this book is essential reading for students and lecturers in women&#8217;s studies, development studies and social theory. It is also a book anyone who wants to understand current global politics - in their widest sense - can not do without. <p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Although hardly a household name in the United States, Saadawi is called by Britain's Guardian, according to her publisher, ""the leading spokeswoman on the status of women in the Arab world."" The 23 essaysmostly academic papers and speeches to conferencesthat make up this collection fall under several general topics that range from women's health to women and Islamic fundamentalism to women organizing for change. A medical doctor who was general director of Egypt's Department of Health, Saadawi was imprisoned by President Anwar Sadat, she claims, after criticizing him for preaching democracy while practicing a dictatorship. After three months, and Sadat's assassination, she was freed by his successor, Hosni Mubarak. The translations of her essays (by various people) tend to be stilted, and Saadawi has a weakness for writing sentences like, ""All these different levels of inequality are linked together in the patriarchal capitalism system that governs the world today."" But when she abandons jargon and speaks directly about issues of poverty, health and women's role in fundamentalist societies, her book sizzles.

0-8262-1176-3,"Women, America, and Movement: Narratives of Relocation (Volume 1)",,University of Missouri,304,7/1/1998,,Hardcover,"<p>Since the colonial days, American women have traveled, migrated, and relocated, always faced with the challenge of reconstructing their homes for themselves and their families. <i>Women, America, and Movement</i> offers a journey through largely unexplored territory—the experiences of migrating American women. These narratives, both real and imagined, represent a range of personal and critical perspectives; some of the women describe their travels as expansive and freeing, while others relate the dreadful costs and sacrifices of relocating.</p>
<p>Despite the range of essays featured in this study, the writings all coalesce around the issues of politics, poetry, and self- identity described by Adrienne Rich as the elements of the ""politics of location,"" treated here as the politics of <i>re</i>location. The narratives featured in this book explore the impact of race, class, and sexual economics on migratory women, their self-identity, and their roles in family and social life. These issues demonstrate that in addition to geographic place, ideology is itself a space to be traversed.</p>
<p>By examining the writings of such women as Louise Erdrich, Zora Neale Hurston, and Gertrude Stein, the essayists included in this volume offer a variety of experiences. The book confronts such issues as racist politicking against Native Americans, African Americans, and Asian immigrants; sexist attitudes that limit women to the roles of wife, mother, and sexual object; and exploitation of migrants from Appalachia and of women newly arrived in America.</p>
<p>These essays also delve into the writings themselves by looking at what happens to narrative structure as authors or their characters cross geographic boundaries. The reader sees how women writers negotiate relocation in their texts and how the written word becomes a place where one finds oneself.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.47930177802 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/67/9780826211767.jpg,Success,160,21.1

She's just like anyone you know, except she's living with HIV. The women portrayed in this profoundly moving volume of essays and photographs speak openly about their feelings and their hopes, while conveying what it is like to be, in the author's words, a woman living with a disease that provokes anger, hatred and denial, yet somehow inspires in us equal measures of compassion, faith, and humanity. As Huston, who is HIV positive herself, has written, like many of the women in this book, I have frequently been misquoted, misunderstood, or censored beyond all recognition. Quite simply, I want these women to tell their remarkable stories.<p>River Huston is a well-known writer, poet, activist, and public speaker on the subject of HIV and AIDS. She has appeared on many television programs, including Good Morning America and Day &amp; Date.

Bold in its historical scope, rich in colorful settings, and eminently readable, <i>Confessions of Madame Psyche</i> also reaches inward, toward quieter truths.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel is narrated by Mei0li Murrow, born in San Francisco in 1895, the illegitimate daughter of a charismatic confidence man and the Chinese prostitute he has rescued from the streets. After her mother's early death, Mei-li is left to care of her mercenary half-sister Erika. When the young Mei-li, by pure coincidence, predicts the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, Erika contructs her identity as Madame Psyche-exploiting Mei'li's exoticism and her clients' yearnings for contact with the dead in a series of ingeniously orchestrated seances that win her renown as a medium in California and then in the death-soaked Europe of the First World War.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, it is when she manages to finally reject the popular spirituality that has made her famous that Mei-li experiences a truer spiritual vision: One day, while walking on the beach, she has a revelation of her connection to all of life-an experience of hidden reality which I have never doubted...and which left me permanently changed by what I then knew and know still and will always know.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei-li's subsequent journey leads her through the aspirations and disappointments of a utopian commune in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the 1920s; to the poverty of migrant work camps in the Depression-era Salinas Valley; and to the courage of the first strikes on San Jose's cannery row. Finally, when the relentless Erika cheats her out of an inheritance by having her committed to the Napa State Hospital, Mee-li finds her greatest wisdom and peace among the outcasts of the asylum-and there writes her confessions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei'li's story is ensconed in the rich history of Northern California in the first half of the twentieth century, and peopled by comrades of many classes and cultures and lovers both male and female; but her central odyssey remains one of inner discovery. In Confessions of Madame Psyche, Dorothy Bryant has created a character who is so honest in her search for truth, growth, and spiritual understanding that this quest becomes inherent to her survival.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.06042348022 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",15.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/63/9781558611863.jpg,Success,107,21.1

0-8147-7477-6,"Opposite Sex: Gay Men on Lesbians, Lesbians on Gay Men",,NYU Press,276,4/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p>The past decade has seen an extraordinary outpouring of research, writing, and talk about lesbian and gay sexuality, triggered in part by the confluence of the AIDS epidemic, the feminist sex wars, and the development of queer studies. Yet many lesbian and gay writers and readers have been frustrated by recurring gaps and absences in the queer studies approach to sexuality, as well as by the limitations of explicit queer community discourse around sex.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Sex</b> brings the sex back into queer studies, making real bodies, acts, and desires central to analysis of the complex relationships between male and female homosexualities, and their impact on lesbian and gay culture. The contributors to this volume--scholars, artists, activists, and journalists--redress the remarkable dearth of thoughtful discourse about the many ways in which lesbian and gay men are implicated--and viewed within--in each other's sexual realities.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Sex</b> includes writing by lesbians and gay men about each other's bodies, interpretations of different male and female homosexual sex cultures, and reflections on the history, sociology, and politics of changing discourses around queer sexuality. Passionate and challenging, this anthology shows the rich and complex forms through which individuals and communities make meaning from their quotidian sexual impulses, their utopian sexual mores, and their idiosyncratic sexual acts.</p>

0-8262-1162-3,Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial (Volume 1),"Moulakis, Athanasios",University of Missouri,280,3/4/1998,,Hardcover,"<p><i>Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial</i> delivers what no other book on Weil has—a comprehensive study of her political thought. In this examination of the development of her thought, Athanasios Moulakis offers a philosophical understanding of politics that reaches beyond current affairs and ideological advocacy.</p>
<p>Simone Weil—philosopher, activist, mystic—unites a profound reflection on the human condition with a consistent and courageous existential and intellectual honesty manifest in the moving testimony of her life and her death. Moulakis examines Weil's political thought as an integral part of a lived philosophy, in which analysis and doctrine are inseparable from the articulation of an intensely personal, ultimately religious experience.</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to distinguish Weil's life from her thought, her writings cannot be understood properly without linking them to her life and character. By situating Weil's political thought within the context of the intellectual climate of her time, Moulakis connects it also to her epistemology, her cosmology, and her personal experience.</p>
<p><i>Simone Weil and the Politics of Self-Denial</i> presents the unfolding of Weil's philosophical life against the backdrop of the political and social conditions of the last days of the Third French Republic, the Spanish Civil War, and the rise and clash of totalitarian ideologies. The ideological climate of the age—of which Weil herself was not quite free—was indeed the major ""obstacle"" in the struggle against which she fashioned her critical, intellectual, and moral tools.</p>
<p>Weil has been categorized a number of ways: as a saint and a near convert to Roman Catholicism, as a social critic, or as an analytic philosopher. Moulakis examines <i>all</i> aspects of Weil's thought in the indissoluble unity in which she lived them. This thorough investigation pursues the particular intellectual affiliations and the social and political experiential stimuli of Weil's work while simultaneously teasing out the timeless themes that her own timely analysis was intended to reveal.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.38 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/20/9780826211620.jpg,Success,160,21.1

<p>Have you ever had a crush on a teacher? I'm sure we all have. From the first day, the first moment you meet them, you're·</p>
<p>Captivated.</p>
<p>Captured.</p>
<p>Committed.</p>
<p>Convicted.</p>
<p>My very first crush was on an English teacher named Mr. Weatherspoon in the second grade. He was fresh out of college and looked so fresh (uh, young) that, after meeting him on parent-teacher conference night, my mother just knew she was on Candid Camera: She thought he was a student masquerading as a teacher. He just took her observation as a compliment and flashed that smile. Lord, that smile. He had what you would call a baby-grand grin. Whenever he flashed it, I would hear them ivories and ebonies being tickled (notice how most forget to mention those black keys). And I don't know what tune was being played, but whatever it was, it was hypnotic - just like him. He always came to class dressed down in a shirt, jacket, slacks, and tie, and his scent was an aftershave lotion called Blue Musk (yes, I had the gall to ask; there was a reporter in me at that age).</p>
<p>I looked forward to when he would hunch over my desk, give me one of those smiles, reach out with that big, brown hand, and crown me the winner of our weekly spelling bee by brushing my head and saying, ""Outstanding, Mitchell. Just outstanding."" And I earned that reward every week: I studied an extra hour each Thursday afternoon to ensure that I held on to my title. When he smiled at me, when he touched me·I don't know, that button was pressed. Yeah, it was an innocent gesture and in no way sexual, but it had the opposite effect: Those homohormones really kicked into gear. I didn't know at that age what it was I was feeling or why I was feeling the way I was, but I knew that I loved the feeling.</p>
<p>But I was fully aware of what I was feeling and why I was feeling it this time. And I was truly enjoying what those homohormones were doing to me. I was in a daze, a haze over Mr. Reid: I just stared into space in all my classes, daydreaming about him. And at night? My wet dreams were so wild that I found my pillow and sheet on the floor in the morning and my underwear soaked. In a sense I had my art teacher, Ms. Yearwood, to thank for that. I dreamed of Mr. Reid</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/78/9781555834678.jpg,Success,101,21.1

<p><i>The Pleasure of the Crown</i> offers a comprehensive look at how Canadian, particularly British Columbian, society “reveals itself” through its courtroom performances in Aboriginal title litigation. Rather than asking what cultural beliefs and practices First Nations draw on to support their appeals for legal recognition of Aboriginal title, Culhane asks what assumptions, beliefs, and cultural values the Crown relies on to assert and defend their claims to hold legitimate sovereignty and jurisdiction over lands and resources in B.C. What empirical evidence does the Crown present to bolster its arguments?

Anne Wagner looks at their imagery and careers, relating their work to three decisive moments in the history of American modernism&#58; the avant-garde of the 1920s, the New York School of the 1940s and 1950s, and the modernist redefinition undertaken in the 1960s. Their artistic contributions were invaluable, Wagner demonstrates, as well as hard-won. She also shows that the fact that these artists were women&#151;the main element linking the three&#151;is as much the index of difference among their art and experience as it is a passkey to what they share.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In this scholarly new book, Wagner (history of art, Univ. of California, Berkeley) skillfully probes and tracks how each of these important American modernists at one time coped with life as both a professional artist and wife of a more famous one. ""O'Keeffe's Femininity"" demonstrates how infamous she was at rendering body imagery: ""to imagine an impossible unionthe passionate coupling of hygiene and scatology, the body and its absence."" Lee Krasner is shown painting her own way through Jackson Pollock's as well as Arshile Gorky's conventions until she eventually achieved autobiographical essays in paint and collage. Eva Hesse is optimistically identified as an innovative commentator on new sexuality, focusing on her body, but not her body alone. This gendered interpretation of three of the foremost American modernist women artists presents an interesting blend of biographical and historical criticism.

She Was The First Woman To Address The U.s. Congress And To Operate A Brokerage Firm On Wall Street. Gloria Steinem Has Called Her The Most Controversial Suffragist Of Them All. Famed Nineteenth-century Political Cartoonist Thomas Nast Portrayed Her As Mrs. Satan. She Butted Heads With Such Pillars Of Society As Cornelius Vanderbilt, Harriet Beecher Stowe, And Susan B. Anthony. So Why Have Most People Never Heard Of Victoria Woodhull? Journalist Mary Gabriel's Authoritative Biography Provides The Answer: She Was Written Out Of History, Censored By Historians Of The Women's Movement As Too Scandalous. Victoria Had Worked As A Traveling Clairvoyant In Medicine Shows. She Was Accused Of Blackmail And Prostitution And Was Jailed For Printing Obscenities. She Preached - And Practiced - The Concept Of Free Love, Once Living With Her Husband, Her Ex-husband, And Her Lover At The Same Time, In The Same New York Apartment. Victoria Was Arguably The Boldest Voice For Women's Rights In The Nineteenth Century, And She Was Taken Very Seriously By Her Contemporaries And By The Media, In Spite Of Her Unconventional Lifestyle. In Notorious Victoria, Gabriel Offers Readers A Balanced Portrait Of A Unique And Complicated Woman. Gabriel Has Extensively Researched Victoria's Entire Life, And Her Book Contains Revealing - And Uncensored - Excerpts From Victoria's Own Writing And Speeches As Well As The News Accounts Of Her Day.

<p>Andrea Ashworth, at age twenty-eight one of the youngest fellows at Oxford University, is a young woman of remarkable charm, poise, and intelligence. Her path to her present life, however, has been far from conventional, and in this striking memoir, written with courage and delicacy, she shares a story that makes her achievements all the more astonishing. Although she only vaguely remembers her father, Andrea quickly becomes aware that the dark skin she inherited from him sets her apart from her English mother and the series of stepfathers who soon enter her life. What follows is a vivid and unforgettable portrait of a family terrorized by the explosive rage of one stepfather and then another, and of a sensitive and observant child, caught in a remorseless cycle of poverty and brutality, who refuses to give into despair. For in the midst of her misery, Andrea discovers a haven in the work of writers such as Joyce and Eliot, who allow her to see a world beyond her own and set her on the path toward intellectual and artistic awakening.

Knopf Canada,444,1998,,Hardcover,"<p>""Written with primal intensity, touched with redeeming compassion, Rudy Wiebe--has explored our history, our roots and the secrets of our hearts with moral seriousness and great feeling."" - Governor General's Award for Fiction Citation, l994<br>
<br>
A powerful, major work of non-fiction, beautifully written, with the impact of Mikal Gilmore's Shot in the Heart, from the twice winner of the Governor General's Award for Fiction and the great-great-granddaughter of Big Bear.<br>
<br>
This is a story about justice, and terrible injustices, a story about a murder, and a courtroom drama as compelling as any thriller as it unravels the events that put Yvonne Johnson behind bars for life, first in Kingston's Federal Prison for Women until the riot that closed it, and presently in the Okimaw Ochi Healing Lodge in the Cypress Hills. But above all it is the unforgettable true story of the life of a Native woman who has decided to speak out and break the silence, written with the redeeming compassion that marks all Rudy Wiebe's writing, and informed throughout by Yvonne Johnson's own intelligence and poetic eloquence.<br>
<br>
Characters and events spring to life with the vividness of fiction. The story is told sometimes in the first person by Rudy Wiebe, sometimes by Yvonne herself. He tracks down the details of Yvonne's early life in Butte, Montana, as a child with a double-cleft palate, unable to speak until the kindness of one man provided the necessary operations; the murder of her beloved brother while in police custody; her life of sexual abuse at the hands of another brother, grandfather and others; her escape to Canada - to Winnipeg and Wetaskiwin; the traumas of her life thatled to alcoholism, and her slow descent into hell despite the love she found with her husband and three children.<br>
<br>
He reveals how she participated, with three others, in the murder of the man she believed to be a child abuser; he unravels the police story, taking us step by step, with jail-taped transcripts, through the police attempts to set one member of the group against the others in their search for a conviction - and the courtroom drama that followed. And Yvonne openly examines her life and, through her grandmother, comes to understand the legacy she has inherited from her ancestor Big Bear; having been led through pain to wisdom, she brings us with her to the point where she finds spiritual strength in passing on the lessons and understandings of her life.<br>
<br>
How the great-great-granddaughter of Big Bear reached out to the author of The Temptations of Big Bear to help her tell her story is itself an extraordinary tale. The co-authorship between one of Canada's foremost writers and the only Native woman in Canada serving life imprisonment for murder has produced a deeply moving, raw and honest book that speaks to all of us, and gives us new insight into the society we live in, while offering a deeply moving affirmation of spiritual healing.</p>",en,First Edition,Weight: 1.75 Pounds,1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/87/9780676970487.jpg,Success,93,21.1

0-8147-9339-8,"Everyday Courage: The Lives and Stories of Urban Teenagers (Qualitative Studies in Psychology, 10)","Way, Niobe",NYU Press,320,4/1/1998,,Paperback,"What does it mean to be a teenager in an American city at the close of the twentieth century? How do urban surroundings affect the ways in which teens grow up, and what do their stories tell us about human development? In particular, how do the negative images of youth on television and in the newspaper affect their perspectives about themselves? Psychologists typically have shown little interest in urban youth, preferring instead to generalize about adolescent development from studies of their middle-class, suburban counterparts. In Ordinary Courage, Niobe Way, a developmental psychologist, looks beyond the stereotypes to reveal how the personal worldviews of inner-city poor and working-class adolescents develop over time. In the process, she challenges much conventional wisdom about inner-city youth and about adolescents more generally.
<p>She introduces us to Malcolm, a sensitive and proud young man full of contradictions. We follow him as he makes the honor roll, becomes a teenage father, and falls into depression as his younger sister is dying of cancer. We meet Eva, an intelligent and confident young women full of questions, who grows increasingly alienated from her mother and comes to rely on her best friends for support. We watch her blossom as a ball player and a poet. We share her triumph when she receives a scholarship to the college of her choice.</p>
<p>In these 24 adolescents, Way finds a cross-section of youngsters who want to make positive changes in their lives and communities while struggling with concerns about betrayal, trust, racism, violence, and death. Each adolescent wants most of all to ""be somebody"", to have her or his voice heard.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 inches, Length: 6 inches, Weight: 0.95019234922 Pounds, Width: 0.8 inches",22.57,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/98/9780814793398.jpg,Success,162,21.1
0-88920-245-1,Breaking Anonymity: The Chilly Climate for Women Faculty,,Wilfrid Laurier University Press,400,5/30/1995,,Paperback,"<p>Across North America a growing body of ""chilly climate"" research documents the role played by environmental factors in reproducing gender inequality: practices that stereotype, exclude and devalue women are persistently powerful forces in creating ""glass ceilings"" and maintaining ""pink ghettos."" Women academics in North American universities and colleges offer an especially striking case for such research. Precisely because of their elite status, the accounts now emerging of the ""chilly climate"" faced by academic women throw into sharp relief the mechanisms that foster gender inequity throughout North American society.</p>
<p>Collected in this volume are a number of reports and commentaries on ""climate issues"" as they affect women faculty in Canadian universities. They include Sheila McIntyre's <i>Memo</i>, an account of gender harassment in the context of a law school that was first circulated in 1986; two reports by and about women faculty at the University of Western Ontario that were inspired by McIntyre's <i>Memo</i>; accounts of the reactions of male colleagues, the administration and the media to ""climate"" studies; and several chapters that critically reframe the discussion of chilly climate practices in terms of questions of race and sexual identity.</p>
<p>Taken together, these reports and discussions demonstrate the importance of addressing the environmental roots of women's continuing inequity both within and outside contemporary academia. They communicate specific experiences which testify to the existence of a chilly climate in our universities, and call into question any supposition that women and men have achieved equity to the degree that they could be said to work in ""the same"" environment in these institutions.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.16183612074 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",32.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/50/9780889202450.jpg,Success,96,21.1

As he does so, he argues that roots of gay identity by showing how the Puritan compact led to the backroom bawdy house, how being ""born again"" is reenacted as ""coming out,"" and how gay men's search for their own identity profoundly echoes American's relentless quest for a national identity of its own. In the end, he demonstrates that while homosexuality may be universal, ""gay identity"" is a twentieth-century creation already being challenged.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.554 Inches",20,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/22/9780374525422.jpg,Success,102,21.1

With over sixty illustrations it serves to introduce the current landscape of Asian and Asian American Art, with essays on art in China, Taiwan and North America, as well as individual essays on leading artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, Xu Bing and Michael Joo. Above all, Yang explores the challenges that contemporary Asian and Asian American art poses to artists, critics, curators and viewers alike. In particular, she reflects on the complexities of exhibition practice, the role of identity politics in arts, the unspoken assumptions of Western critics faced with Asian art, and the difficulties faced by artists working between cultures. This is a major critical contribution in an area where criticism conspicuously lags behind artistic practice.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.15081300764 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",19.02,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/94/9780814735794.jpg,Success,162,21.1

Delicate, Deeply Considered, And Moving. &#151;publishers Weekly</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>in Spare, Lyrical Prose, Ehrlich Inventively Recounts Her 1995 Spiritual Trip To China And Tibet. I Had Come To China To Pick Up The Threads Of A Once Flourishing Buddhist Culture, She Writes, And Thought I Could Find It In Their Sacred Mountains. First On Ehrlich's Itinerary Was To Climb Emei Shan, One Of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains. She Interweaves The Tale Of Her Climb-encounters With Nasty Monkeys, Frisbee-tossing Monks And Countless Buddhist Temples Being Renovated By The Chinese Government For Tourist Purposes-with Concise Meditations On The Meaning Of Mountains To Chinese Religious Culture: The Chinese Phrase For `going On A Pilgrimage' Actually Means `paying One's Respects To The Mountain.'  Ehrlich's Gentle Idealization Of The Beautiful Arts Of Chinese Dynastic Buddhism Is All But Blasted Away When She Witnesses The Religious Shards Left By The Cultural Revolution. Her Book Is An Elegantly Kaleidoscopic Fusion Of Travelogue, Musings On Traditional Chinese Buddhism And Appreciation Of Chinese Landscape Paintings Of Mountains. Like One Of The Landscape Paintings Of Which She Writes, Ehrlich's Book Is At Once Delicate, Deeply Considered And Moving.

0-9641099-3-X,Billy's Boy,"Warren, Patricia Nell",Wildcat Press,339,11/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p>The powerful story of a teenage boy's odyssey, Billy's Boy has already been a #1 bestseller on the Lambda and Advocate lists in hardcover, and has garnered rave reviews from Library Journal, Lambda Book Report, and The Washington Blade.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Clumsy characterizations mar the sequel to Warren's bestselling gay novels, The Front-runner and Harlan's Race. Billy's Boy is about John William Seden, the son of dead gay track star Billy Sive. A 12-year-old science geek with his head in the stars, narrator William (he goes by his middle name) uses the phrase potty mouth with sincerity, calls his mom's best friend Auntie and is completely ignorant about sex. He doesn't have an inkling that his mom (a women's track coach whose favorite exclamation is Goddess!) is a lesbian; she, despite her political fervor, remains uncharacteristically closeted to her pubescent son. The novel opens as the Hedens are moving from Sacramento to conservative Orange County, Calif. William quickly becomes friends with Shawn, a neighbor his age, but when their relationship becomes sexual, Shawn's born-again parents put an end to it. The Hedens then flee to Auntie's home near L.A., where William's search for information about his dead father brings him closer to a family he never knew he had, into the life and times of the L.A. riots and into the urban teen pastimes of clubbing and drugs. Warren's experience as an educator of gay teens lends her young characters some needed realism. While clichd situations and clunky dialogue leave much to be desired, Warren's fans will no doubt be eager to continue following the lives of their friends Harlan, Vince, Chino and Betsy through a new, young pair of eyes.

Weaving together the strands of ecology theory, epidemiology, and sexual politics, he shows how the AIDS epidemic, like other epidemics from influenza and bubonic plague to today's rapidly emerging viruses - result as much from human behaviors as from specific microbes. He argues convincingly that AIDS was probably an old and rare disease syndrome in humans that erupted into an epidemic only when cultural changes - including the gay male sexual revolution of the seventies - created ideal conditions for its evolution and spread. For the first time ever, Rotello describes in detail the surprising scientific consensus about why, precisely, AIDS hit gay men so hard. Rebutting both the left's position that AIDS was merely an accident, and simplistic right-wing theories that blame promiscuity alone, Rotello presents the compelling but troubling verdict embraced by epidemiologists: AIDS was spread by a fusion of factors built right into the fabric of urban gay life after Stonewall. Turning to current research, Rotello explains how and why researchers believe a ""second wave"" of the epidemic is saturating gay men despite widespread AIDS awareness and condom use. And he provides compelling evidence that if the current lack of ecological awareness continues, our best chance of containing the epidemic with newly available drug therapies could be squandered.

                        <p>Intensively researched, passionately argued, and intellectually rigorous, this book sounds a clarion call for the revision of the gay male community's beliefs about and approaches to AIDS. Not since And the Band Plays On has there been another book with the power to fundamentally challenge social perceptions of this virulent modern plague. 352 pp. National ads/media. Author tour.

But even though a lot of people would like to become lesbians, like anything that requires a major break with old habits, becoming a lesbian is not the easiest thing in the world to pull off. Lesbians have their own culture, their own lingo, their own way of doing things.

Going beyond previous studies, <i>Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder</i> focuses upon Wilder&rsquo;s years in Missouri from 1894 to 1957. Utilizing her unpublished autobiography, letters, newspaper stories, and other documentary evidence, John E. Miller fills the gaps in Wilder&rsquo;s autobiographical novels and describes her sixty-three years of living in Mansfield, Missouri. As a result, the process of personal development that culminated in Wilder&rsquo;s writing of the novels that secured her reputation as one of America&rsquo;s most popular children&rsquo;s authors becomes evident.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>It takes Miller one-third of this fact-clogged biography to start showing Laura Ingalls Wilder as ""the woman behind the legend,"" but when he finally does, the picture is fascinating. Wilder, whose seven semiautobiographical 'Little House on the Prairie' books have been read by millions and inspired a television series, was a bossy wife, a penny-pincher who once protested her power company's rates by having her electricity shut off and a political right-winger. By far the most absorbing aspect of Miller's book is the story of Wilder's relationship with her only child. Rose Wilder Lane was a childless divorce and an established writer by the time her mother began writing novels at age 63, and she edited her mother's books and got her agent to handle them. Miller draws heavily on Lane's diaries and letters, which often contain diatribes against a mother she alternately loved and resented. But while Wilder left no personal papers presenting her side, Miller seems to paint a balanced portrait. He's not so balanced elsewhere, and in an effort to contextualize his subject, he often presents reams of redundant or unnecessary political, geographical and cultural details that bog down what is otherwise a very interesting story.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",50,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/75/9780826211675.jpg,Success,160,21.1

In Paris, January was a surgeon; in New Orleans, his life is constrained by a rigid set of rules that control his every move. He is known as a ""free man of color,"" but in 1833, that freedom is tenuous at best. <P> January has found a position playing piano at the Salle d'Orleans, where the Blue Ribbon Ball of this year's Carnival caps the season's revelry. The Blue Ribbon Ball, in New Orleans's strict caste system, is the quadroon ball, where the light-skinned, beautiful daughters of colored society dance with their white ""protectors"" -- while their protectors' wives and families are at the subscription ball in the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre next door. From the safety of his piano bench, January is able to watch and comment upon the goings-on. But that detachment doesn't last. <P> The most beautiful -- and the most poisonous -- belle of the ball, the infamous Angelique Crozat, has infuriated everyone present, from the young suitor whose stutter she has publicly mocked, to the girls whose dresses she has purposefully made somewhat less than beautiful -- including the widow of her late protector, who has violated every caste rule in order to confront her. <P> When Angelique is discovered, in a parlor of the Salle, strangled to death, January becomes embroiled in a pursuit of the killer -- only to discover that the authorities are investigating <I>him</I>.

Along with the rest of her tribe, Concha is driven from her homeland and eventually finds her way to Tucson, where she finds a job cleaning houses and caring for children.

0-521-63989-1,Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography,"Conn, Peter",Cambridge University Press,500,1/28/1998,,Paperback,"<p>'an Elegant, Absorbing Book.' Washington Post</p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>in This Brilliantly Conceived Biography, Conn, An English Professor At The University Of Pennsylvania, Sets Out To Reconstruct Buck's Life, Her Extraordinary Commitment To Social Justice And Her Literary Achievement. To Her Many (primarily Male) Critics, Buck Was An Overrated Storyteller Whose Best-selling Portrayals Of Chinese Peasants Struggling In A Land On The Brink Of Revolution In No Way Merited The Pulitzer Or Nobel Prizes. Time And The Reading Public Seem To Have Agreed, As Only The Good Earth Survivesprincipally As A Late-night Movie Classic. Born In West Virginia In 1892 To Protestant Missionary Parents, Pearl Sydenstricker Spent Almost All Of Her First 40 Years In China. Although She Was Bilingual, She Felt An Outsider In Both Countries, And Conn Speculates That Her Experiences In China's White Minority Led To A Lifelong Advocacy Of Interracial Understanding. She Went To College In The U.s., But Returned To China, Where She Married Her First Husband, J. Lossing Buck, And Gave Birth To Her Only Child, Who Suffered From Phenylketonuria (pku). Then, In 1934, Faced With The Japanese Invasion, Civil Tensions And Escalating Anti-foreigner Sentiment, The Bucks Returned To The U.s. As Her Literary Works Slipped Into Obscurity, Buck Spent The Decades Until Her Death In 1973 Devoting Herself To Issues Of Interracial Conflict, Immigration And The Adoption Of Disadvantaged Children, Eventually Establishing Welcome House, The First International, Interracial Adoption Agency. Perhaps Buck's Fortunes Have Finally Turned, For She Has Been Singularly Lucky In Her Biographer. Drawing On Buck's Own Words And Actions, Conn Steers A Sympathetic Yet Intelligently Balanced Course, Revealing In Fascinating Detail The Gripping Life Story Of A Compelling Woman. Photos.

0-8147-4237-8,"At Home with Pornography: Women, Sexuality, and Everyday Life","Juffer, Jane",NYU Press,280,7/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p>Twenty-five years after the start of the feminist sex wars, pornography remains a flashpoint issue, with feminists locked in a familiar argument: Are women victims or agents? In <b>At Home with Pornography</b>, Jane Juffer exposes the fruitlessness of this debate and suggests that it has prevented us from realizing women's changing relationship to erotica and porn.</p>
<p>Over the course of these same twenty-five years, there has been a proliferation of sexually explicit materials geared toward women, made available in increasingly mainstream venues. In asking ""what is the relationship of women to pornography?"" Juffer maintains that we need to stop obsessing over pornography's transgressive aspects, and start focusing on the place of porn and erotica in women's everyday lives. Where, she asks, do women routinely find it, for how much, and how is it circulated and consumed within the home? How is this circulation and consumption shaped by the different marketing categories that attempt to distinguish erotica from porn, such as women's literary erotica and sexual self-help videos for couples?</p>
<p>At <b>Home with Pornography</b> responds to these questions by viewing women's erotica within the context of governmental regulation that attempts to counterpose a ""dangerous"" pornography with the sanctity of the home. Juffer explorers how women's consumption of erotica and porn for their own pleasure can be empowering, while still acting to reinforce conservative ideals. She shows how, for instance, the Victoria's Secret catalog is able to function as a kind of pornography whose circulation is facilitated both by its reliance on Victorian themes of secrecy and privacy and on its appeals to the selfish pleasures of modern career women. In her pursuit to understand what women like and how they get it, Juffer delves into adult cable channels, erotic literary anthologies, sex therapy guides, cyberporn, masturbation, and sex toys, showing the varying degrees to which these materials have been domesticated for home consumption.</p>
<p>Representing the next generation of scholarship on pornography, <b>At Home with Pornography</b> will transform our understanding of women's everyday sexuality.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.87964442538 pounds, Width: 0.71 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/72/9780814742372.jpg,Success,162,21.1

The Language of Fertility challenges the traditionally held view that problems with fertility are due to purely a medical condition to be treated with drugs and surgery. Niravi Payne explains how affected and men's bodies and minds can be so affected by generations of their family's beliefs and patterns of behavior that their natural fertility and ability to conceive can be blocked. Her unique techniques of self-analysis help women, men, and couples become conscious about how they need to change their minds and their lives to reclaim their natural fertility and conceive and give birth to a baby. Her methods are helpful at any time - whether used while undergoing medical reproductive treatments, between treatments, or independent of any medical treatment. In the Whole Person Fertility Program, Payne leads readers through the same exercises, family tree mappings, meditations, visualizations, and journal-writing that have helped her clients break through the emotional barriers to conception and have led them to heal their whole lives - whether or not pregnancy occurs. And she tells dozens of inspiring and compelling case studies from her own practice, in which her clients have healed their relationships to their spouses, siblings, and other family members, and as a direct result have been able to conceive.

Women must look critically at who is in charge of the new technology and challenge the gender codes that can work against them. In this path-breaking book, Melanie Stewart Millar explores power relations in the digital world and asks us to question what is really going on. How is technology shaping our future? What is the role of women within digital culture? What is the corporate agenda? How is it influencing women&amp;apos;s work?</p>
<p>Provocative and incisive, Cracking the Gender Code questions how the gains women have made through feminism over the last decades are being eroded. It looks specifically at how the articles and images of Wired, the magazine of the digital generation, are detrimental to women — a discourse that may be establishing the underlying ideology of a far-reaching communications industry. Stewart Millar argues that simply being computer literate or knowing how to use the Net is not good enough. Women need to demystify the technology and crack the gender code to participate equally in the cyber world of the future.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.70106999316 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/46/9781896764146.jpg,Success,17,21.1

This transitional period in a woman's life has often been misdiagnosed or ignored. Now Stephanie Bender, an expert in women's hormonal health, sounds a wake-up call for the confusing years before menopause, which require special emotional, dietary, and health guidance.
<p><b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explains how symptoms such as irregular cycles, night sweats and insomnia, decreased libido, memory lapses, and mood swings can be traced to fluctuating hormones. It gives detailed recommendations on how to use both conventional and alternative approaches to lessen symptoms, including the most up-to-date research and new treatments. Bender also goes beyond medical advice to show women how all facets of their lives, from diet to attitude to lifestyle, can be transformed to make this an exciting and productive phase. Perimenopause is a time when women can reconsider their beliefs and priorities with newfound wisdom--perhaps discarding outmoded images of female beauty and examining their relationships with lovers and family on a deeper level. <b>The Power of Perimenopause</b> explores this neglected age with practical ways to enhance the quality of all areas of women's lives.</p>

Of Calif., Davis; Brave New Families, 1990) Joins The Family Values Fray On The Side Of Americans Who Have No Leisure To Debate The Virtues Of How A Two-parents/mom-at-home Family Benefits Children. They Are Too Busy Scrambling To Earn A Living; Even If There Is An Involved Father, Mom Can't Afford To Stay Home Anymore. In A Relatively Short Text (there Are More Than 40 Pages Of Notes And Bibliography), Stacey Argues That Poverty And Unemployment, Among Other Social And Economic Forces, Have Driven The Reshaping Of The American Family And That Critics, Whether On The Right Or The Left, Have Two Choices&#58; They Can Accept And Work With The Array Of Families As They Actually Exist, Or They Can Continue To Deny Conditions As They Are. Moreover, She Finds That Reorganized Families Cut Across Economic And Class Lines; They Are Not Limited To Either The Poor Or The Upper Middle Class. Both Liberals And Conservatives Target The Fatherless Household As A Prime Disrupter Of Family Values, But Stacey Sees The Campaign To Restore The Father To His Supposedly Rightful Place As Thinly Disguised Form Of Anti-feminism, Racism, And Homophobia. One Chapter Is Devoted To How Groups Of Social Scientists Have Supported This Intensely Conservative Viewpoint Despite Research To The Contrary. A Final Chapter Defends Homosexual Marriages And Parenting Practices, Offering This Group's Flexible Family Arrangements As An Example Of New Family Values In Microcosm.<p> Addressed More To The Author's Sociologist And Feminist Colleagues Than To The General Reader.

<p>""This volume makes no attempt to rival those gay travel guides that already exist. It is something different, far more intriguing: a collection of stories that aim at being what Herman Melville deemed ""an inside narrative."" That is, what being a gay man in a foreign land really feels like, smells like, tastes like, and hurts like. The voices here might be likened to those of friends sitting around a dinner table the night before your journey who provide you with insights and warnings that only later do you discover add infinitely to your excursion.""</p>

Even new programs, such as 'John Schools' for customers and training in life skills for service providers, have been ineffective. Deborah Brock asks if our approach to prostitution is fundamentally flawed. We generally think of it as a social problem, but prostitutes see it as a work relation.</p><p>Anti-prostitution campaigns and attempts to regulate the sex trade have been made and re-made over the past few decades. In the 1970s and 1980s urban development and new policing strategies displaced workers from established prostitution strolls. Movements for social and sexual liberation turned the business of selling sex into a complex political issue. The Canadian state was confronted with a range of regulatory approaches, advocated by competing interest groups. Deborah Brock examines how prostitution in Canada has been produced as a social problem. Contending that 'social problems do not exist objectively,' Brock interprets the role of various actors in mounting the urban sex trade spectacle: the media, feminist organizations, rights advocates, residents' groups, and state agents and agencies such as the police, politicians, the courts, and government commissions.</p><p><b>Making Work, Making Trouble</b> is the first critical survey of prostitution in Canada. It provides much needed context to all groups enmeshed in the melTe over territory and rights and should become a standard source in Canadian criminology.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.96 Inches, Length: 5.95 Inches, Weight: 0.74516244556 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/50/9780802079350.jpg,Success,94,21.1

War, fame, marriage, love, and heartbreak came and went. What never changed was the bond she shared with her two best friends, Effa Commander and Whippy Bird. When scandal, murder, and betrayal made a legend of May Anna, only Effa and Whippy Bird could set the record straight.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Narrator Effa Commander's rollicking reminiscences about movie star Marion Street and her devoted lover, champion boxer Buster Midnight, are recounted in a sharp and snappy voice that captures the reader's interest on the very first page of this amusing novel. Effa Commander and lifelong friend Whippy Bird shared childhood, adolescence, Prohibition and many other experiences with Marion and Buster in their hometown of Butte, Mont. They also know much more about the Hollywood scandal called the ``Love Triangle Murder'' than ever got into the papers, and Effa Commander has decided to vindicate her friends' misrepresented lives. Dallas's first novel depicts a remarkable cluster of enduring friendships that may strike the modern urban reader as implausible, but accurately reflect the flavor of a small town and its inbred relationships. If the denouement seems predictable, Dallas, whose work calls to mind Fannie Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle-Stop Cafe , is nonetheless a stylist to be reckoned with.

0-14-118041-2,Kristin Lavransdatter I: The Wreath (Penguin Classics),"Undset, Sigrid",Penguin Classics,336,12/1/1997,,Paperback,"<p>In <b>Kristin Lavransdatter</b> (1920-1922), <b>Sigrid Undset</b> interweaves political, social, and religious history with the daily aspects of family life to create a colorful, richly detailed tapestry of Norway during the fourteenth-century. The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life—her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith—profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of ""historical novels."" This new translation by Tina Nunnally—the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s—captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition.</p>
<p> Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. <b>Kristin Lavransdatter</b> became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world.</p>",en,F First Paperback Edition Used,"Height: 0.8 Inches, Length: 7.7 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches",16,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/10/9780141180410.jpg,Success,178,21.1

So powerful that even the other gods and goddesses cannot defy them, the Fates are said to control the thread of each life. The ancient Europeans knew the secrets of communicating with the three sisters who preside over our daily lives, but such arcane knowledge has been lost in modern times.<br>
<br>
In Northern Europe the Fates are known as the Norns: Urdh, Verdandi, and Skuld. The sisters correspond to the past (what has been), the present (what is now), and the future (what must be). The three in turn rule our lives in thirty-year cycles—childhood and young adulthood are ruled by Urdh, adulthood by Verdandi, and the crone years by Skuld. The Fates are especially active at the major life turning points, when we receive new missions for our life's work. These main turning points occur in the early thirties and late fifties when restlessness with your previous life can take on a sense of extreme urgency. At such times, the Fate who oversees your next destiny is reaching out to you. Summoning the Fates is the first book to show how to interact with these primal forces to fulfill the destiny that awaits you. Z. Budapest gives spells, rituals, and prayers to bring the psychological and material support you need into your life.<br>
<br>
Z. uses folk stories from her native Hungary and many other countries, personal anecdotes from real women, historical facts, and ""fate works""—exercises that teach you how to recognize, interact with, and ultimately summon the Fates. With the Fates on your side, you will be able to understand and better your life.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",20,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/36/9780517708736.jpg,Success,163,21.1

1-57322-681-5,There Are No Accidents: Synchronicity and the Stories of Our Lives,"Hopcke, Robert H.",Riverhead Books,272,7/1/1998,,Paperback,"<p>In this inspiring book, Robert H. Hopcke, a Jungian psychotherapist, explores the role of synchronicity in our love life and our work life, in our waking life and our dream life, in our everyday life and our dream life, in our everyday life and our spiritual life. Through interviews with people whose lives have been changed by some unexpected chance encounter, he presents us with a rich array of true synchronistic stories: a woman is set up on a blind date with the same man, years apart, on two different coasts; a singer's career changes direction when she walks into the wrong audition; just when he is feeling particularly alone, a man runs into a college friend at a remote outpost on an island in the South Pacific. Not only does Hopcke present these stories to us, he shows us how, by looking at our lives as coherent narratives, with synchronistic experiences the turning points in the plot, we can use the synchronicities we experience to lead our lives more meaningfully.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>While people have a tendency to deny, dismiss, or discount synchronistic events, Hopcke contends that when greeted with openness and acceptance, these occurrences, which briefly connect one's inner and outer life by shattering normal interpretive frameworks, have the power and purpose of transformation. As Hopcke, Director of the Jungian Center for Symbolic Studies, explains Jung's 45-year-old coinage, a synchronistic event must take place at a transitional moment in one's life and must defy a simple cause-and-effect explanation. It must also be personally meaningful or symbolic; one person's life-transforming event is another's banality. The bulk of the book focuses on relationships, work, dreams, spirituality and matters of life and death, anecdotally illustrating how synchronicity often leads people in the direction they unknowingly need to go. While synchronicity has gotten a lot of play in psychological and New Age circles, skeptics remain. Hopcke's lively, accessible interpretations of a plethora of real-life events will make their doubts difficult to maintain.

<p>Mainstream culture has increasingly become the locus for challenge by racial minorities. Beginning with the Royal Ontario Museum's Into the Heart of Africa exhibition, and following through with discussions of Show Boat, Miss Saigon, the exhibition of the Barnes Collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the 'Writing Thru Race' conference in Vancouver, and the ill-fated attempts to acquire a licence for a black/dance radio station in Toronto, the authors examine manifestations of racism in Canada's cultural production over the last decade. A 'radical' multiculturalism, they argue, is difference as a politicized force, and arises whenever cultural imperialism is challenged.</p>",en,2nd Revised ed.,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.97 Inches, Weight: 1.00971715996 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/05/9780802071705.jpg,Success,94,21.1

At five-foot-eleven and 185 pounds, supermodel Emme is challenging conventional concepts of beauty. Since her early teenage years, well-meaning relatives encouraged Emme to lose weight. Through the years, she got the message: Happiness could be hers only after she dipped below a certain number on the scale. Not until she began to row crew in college did she come to view size as an asset - an asset that eventually earned her an invitation to the 1984 United States Olympic team trials in Princeton. She began to question assumptions about body image she'd long harbored; only then did she start to lead a happy life. In True Beauty she recounts her dramatic success story, and discusses overcoming stereotypes through dressing, shopping, dating, relationships, job interviews, travel, and exercise. Developing a positive mental image is critical to developing a positive public image, she writes; one reinforces the other.",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/30/9780399523830.jpg,Success,167,21.1

How often do politicians come out forthrightly in support of gay rights? Drawing on more than three hundred interviews with activists, politicians, officials, legislative aides, and journalists, David Rayside shows that gays, lesbians, and their political issues are still on the fringe of the political mainstream. His landmark study of political access demonstrates that, despite the overall tempering of anti-gay rhetoric in the 1990s, opponents of equality are formidable, and standing up for sexual minorities is still widely thought to be politically risky.Rayside documents a high-profile controversy in each of three countries: gays and lesbians in the military in the United States, sexual orientation and human rights legislation in Canada, and the age-of-consent battle in the United Kingdom. In addition, in-depth interviews of openly gay elected officials from three countries-U.S. Congressman Barney Frank, Canadian Member of Parliament Svend Robinson, and British M.P. Chris Smith-provide an inside look at the political process: the negotiation of gay and lesbian policy issues on a daily basis, the attitudes of colleagues in various political parties, and the tensions created when grassroots and mainstream activism intersect with each other. The only major book to look at gay and lesbian politics in three culturally similar but politically disparate countries, On the Fringe explores the political workings and impact of a modern social movement.",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/45/9780801483745.jpg,Success,153,21.1

You’ll also get a handle on the many future implications the drug may have in our society of scientists, legal officials, average citizens, and all-night partiers.
<p>Put simply, no other publication will so concisely and clearly help you synthesize the structural significance, legal controversy, and adverse reactions surrounding Ecstasy as The Love Drug. Overall, its thought-provoking and informative treatment of the topic will give you a balanced, impartial view of Ecstasy’s past and present-day history. And on the other hand, it may also act as a pivotal deterrent if you’re someone who has experimented with this sometimes quixotic mind-altering substance. Specifically, its indepth examination will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the complete synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), its patent, chemical configuration, and pharmacological action</li>
<li>see the connection of this chemical substance to its infamous, alluring moniker—Ecstasy</li>
<li>get an accurate synopsis of the full oral and written legal history of the drug</li>
<li>become familiar with the adverse reactions ascribed to Ecstasy use</li>
<li>understand the place of Ecstasy in the realm of psychotherapy</li>
<li>see how Ecstasy and the Rave movement perpetuate each other
<p>If you’re one of the many who have made all-night partying a science, The Love Drug will clear away the dogma and show you the many ways this drug could change your life. If you’re a preclinical researcher, educator, or member of an emergency room team, you’ll find this book a priceless source of contemporary information.</p>

Sandra Harding introduces and discusses an array of postcolonial science studies, and their implications for ""northern"" science. All three science studies strains have developed in the context of post-World War II science and technology projects. They illustrate how technoscientific projects mean different things to different groups. The meaning attached by the culture of the West may not be shared or may be diametrically opposite in the cultures in other parts of the world. All, however, would agree that scientific projects &#151; modern science included &#151; are ""local knowledge systems."" The interests and discursive resources that the various science studies bring groups to their projects, and the ways that they organize the production of their kind of science studies, are distinctively culturally-local also. While their projects may be unintentionally converging, they also conflict in fundamental respects.How is this inevitable cultural-situatedness of knowledge both an invaluable resource as well as a limitation on the advance of knowledge about nature? What are the distinctive resources that the feminist and postcolonial science theorists offer in thinking about the history of modern science; the diversity of ""scientific"" traditions in non-European as well as in European cultures; and the directions that might be taken by less androcentric and Eurocentric scientific projects? How might modern sciences' projects be linked more firmly to the prodemocratic yearnings that are so widely voiced in contemporary life? Carefully balancing poststructuralist and conventional epistemological resources, this study concludes by proposing new directions for thinking about objectivity, method, and reflexivity in light of the new understandings developed in the post-World War II world.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",20,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/69/9780253211569.jpg,Success,154,21.1

No one alive remembers that first horrific onslaught and no one believes in its return--except for the dragonriders. For two centuries they have been practicing and training, passing down from generation to generation the formidable Threadfighting techniques. <br><br>Now the ominous signs are appearing: the violent winter storms and volcanic eruptions that are said to herald the approach of the Red Star and its lethal spawn. But one stubborn Lord Holder, Chalkin of Bitra, refuses to believe--and that disbelief could spell disaster. So as the dragonriders desperately train to face a terrifying enemy, they and the other Lord Holders must find a way to deal with Chalkin--before history repeats itself and unleashes its virulence on all of Pern. . . .<br><br><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The 11th book of McCaffrey's popular Dragonriders of Pern series, just entering its 30th year, revives the menace of the deadly Thread, silver strands that rain from the sky and destroy all organic life. The planet Pern hasn't seen Thread for more than 250 years. But ominous signs-violent winter storms and sudden volcanic eruptions-herald the approach of the Red Star, believed to be the source of Threadfall. While loyal Dragonriders begin training in earnest, trying to sharpen Thread-fighting skills that haven't been needed for centuries (dragon's fire being the only effective weapon against Thread), the Lord Holders of the land must prepare Pern's inhabitants for the coming danger. A single stingy Lord's refusal to cooperate in the preparations, however, threatens the safety of everyone around him. Meanwhile, teachers toil to develop a new curriculum to preserve knowledge before it is lost forever. McCaffrey (The Dolphins of Pern) brings us another diverse cast of responsible, heroic good guys and dragons in a novel that's going to please fans old and new-and probably burn up the charts like dragon's fire.

What would it take to ensure that all of us can succeed at getting the job done, the problem solved, and the future more secure?</i> <P>As a student at Yale Law School in 1974, Lani Guinier attended a class with a white male professor who addressed all the students, male and female, as gentlemen. To him the greeting was a form of honorific, evoking the values of traditional legal education. To her it was profoundly alienating.<P>Years later Guinier began a study of female law students with her colleagues, Michelle Fine and Jane Balin, to try to understand the frustrations of women law students in male-dominated schools. Women are now entering law schools in large numbers, but too often many still do not feel welcome. As one says, I used to be very driven, competitive. Then I started to realize that all my effort was getting me nowhere. I just stopped caring. I am scarred forever. <P>After interviewing hundreds of women with similar stories, the authors conclude that conventional one-size-fits-all approaches to legal education discourage many women who could otherwise succeed and, even more, fail to help all students realize their full potential as legal problem-solvers.<P>In <i>Becoming Gentlemen</i> Guinier, Fine, and Balin dare us to question what it means to become qualified, what a fair goal in education might be, and what we can learn from the experience of women law students about teaching and evaluating students in general. Including the authors' original study and two essays and a personal afterword by Lani Guinier, the book challenges us to work toward a more just society, based on ideals of cooperation, the resources of diversity, and the values of teamwork.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Guinier argues here against what she calls one-size-fits-all legal education, which, given the lead author (Guinier is a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Clinton's one-time nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights) and the subject, should be interesting. Unfortunately, this is a lightly padded study conducted by the authors along with law students Ann Bartow and Deborah Lee Stachel. By analyzing the responses of 366 first-, second- and third-year U. of Pennsylvania law students (fairly evenly divided between genders), the authors argue that standardized tests may not identify who will become a good lawyer; that treating all students the same is not necessarily treating them all fairly; and that the present program of standardized tests and Socratic classroom instruction may not be what is best suited to the future needs of the legal profession, which may benefit more from teamwork and cooperation. This last point warranted a stronger argument to bolster the authors' call for less aggressive instruction. The survey results, too, would have been more persuasive had objective observation been added to the students' self-reporting and if the questionnaire had been applied to other law schoolsparticularly since the authors note that the relatively gender-neutral findings of a Stanford survey may be attributable to the distinctive environment of Stanford. The converted may overlook some of these weaknesses, while the skeptical will be made more so by remarks from both students (I really resent feeling like after I am laying out all of this money... I should be forced to participate) and authors (law schools fail to equalize the experience and outcomes for all law students across gender).
