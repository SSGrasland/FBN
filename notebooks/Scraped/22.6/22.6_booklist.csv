Rather, We Need A Historical Perspective That Is Attuned To Cultural And Political Differences Within The Same Time As Well As The Leaky Boundaries Between Different Times. Neither The Modern Nor The Postmodern Are Unified, Coherent, Or Self-evident Realities. Drawing On Cultural Studies And Critical Theory, Felski Examines A Range Of Themes Central To Debates About Postmodern Culture, Including Changing Meanings Of Class, The End Of History, The Status Of Art And Aesthetics, Postmodernism As The End Of Sex, And The Politics Of Popular Culture.

0-8147-3619-X,Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses,,NYU Press,287,11/1/2000,,Paperback,"<p><p>In India, God can be female. The goddesses of Hinduism and Buddhism represent the largest extant collection of living goddesses anywhere on the planet. Feminists in the West often draw upon South Asian goddesses as theological resources in the contemporary rediscovery of the Goddess. Yet, these goddesses are products of a male supremacist society.<p> <p>What is the impact of powerful female deities--their images, projections, textuality, and history--on the social standing and psychological health of women? Do they empower women, or serve the interests of patriarchal culture? <b>Is the Goddess a Feminist?</b> looks at the goddesses of South Asia to address these questions directly.<p> <p>Not a book about a single goddess or even about a variety of South Asian goddesses, the volume raises questions about images of deities as symbols and the ways in which they function. Contributors discuss contemporary Indian women who have embraced goddesses as spiritually and socially liberating, as well as the seeming contradictions between the power of Indian goddesses and the lives of Indian women. They also explore such topics as the element of male desire in the embodiment of female deities, the question of who speaks for the goddesses, and the politics and theology of Western feminist use of Hindu and Buddhist goddesses as models for their feminist reflections.<p></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>American and Indian scholars of religion, anthropology, women's studies, and psychology look at the complex relationship between the living worship of female divinities and women in India. In keeping with the multiplicity, especially of Hinduism but also Buddhism and Jainism, the anthology presents a number of sometimes conflicting views rather than a consistent account.

0-8147-1555-9,Radical Feminism: A Documentary Reader,,NYU Press,592,1/31/2000,,Paperback,"The second wave of feminism was one of the most significant political and cultural developments of the 1960s and 1970s. Yet the role radical feminism played within the women's movement remains hotly contested. For some, radical feminism has made a lasting contribution to our understanding Sing of male privilege, and the ways the power imbalance between men and women affects the everyday fabric of women's lives. For others, radical feminism represents a reflexive hostility toward men, sex, and heterosexuality, and thus is best ignored or forgotten.
<p>Rather than have the movement be interpreted by others, Radical Feminism permits the original work of radical feminists to speak for itself. Containing pivotal documents written by U.S. radical feminists in the 1960s and 1970s, Radical Feminism includes unpublished and previously published manifestos, position papers, minutes of meetings, and newsletters. Consisting of documents that are nearly impossible to find, or are in danger of being lost altogether, this panoramic collection is organized around the key issues of sex and sexuality, race, children, lesbianism, separatism, and class. Barbara A. Crow rescues the groundbreaking original work of such groups as The Furies, Red-stockings, Cell 16, and the Women's Liberation Movement. Contributors include Kate Millet, Susan Brownmiller, Shulamith Firestone, Rosalyn Baxandall, Toni Morrison, Ellen Willis, Anne Koedt, and Vivian Gornick.</p>
<p>Gathered for the first time in one volume, these primary sources of radical feminism will fill a major gap in the literature on feminism and feminist thought. Radical Feminism will be an indispensable resource for future generations of feminists, scholars, andactivists.</p>",en,,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 2.18919026166 Pounds, Width: 1.16 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/50/9780814715550.jpg,Success,49,22.6

William Murray was devoted to his mother, Natalia Danesi Murray, and to his mother's longtime lover, writer Janet Flanner. Even as a teenager, he accepted their unconventional relationship. His portrait of the two most important people in his life is unforgettable.</p>
<p>Janet Flanner was already celebrated as the author of a new style of personal journalism for her ""Letter from Paris: in <i>The New Yorker</i> when she met the Italian-born Natalia Murray on Fire Island, New York, in 1940. Their encounter, writes William Murray, was a ""<i>coup de foudre</i>, a thunderbolt that instantly sent them rushing into each other's arms and forever altered their lives, as well as mine.""</p>
<p>Murray was already growing up in two cultures on different continents, in New York and Rome, when his mother's life changed so dramatically. He quickly accepted Flanner and the unusual household in which he found himself. (Natalia's mother, Mammina Ester, also lived with them in New York.) His memories of the women and of his own boyhood and adolescence are touching and often hilarious.</p>
<p><i>Janet, My Mother, and Me</i> offers a look at the world in which gay professional women moved in the decades before such relationships became more open and accepted. Murray's mother was a publishing executive and a broadcaster, and Murray, who originally hoped to become an opera singer and trained for that profession, eventually moved into the professions of both his mother and Flanner, becoming a novelist and then for many years an editor and writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>.</p>

It is the history of our nation told through eyewitness accounts.

<p>Penny Colman is a widely published, award-winning author of books, essays, stories, and articles. She writes for all ages and covers a range of subjects. Colman's books have been named in the Best Books for Young Adults, Notable Books for Children, and Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers (American Library Association); Teacher's Choice and Young Adult Choice (International Reading Association); Best Children's Book of the Year (Bank Street College of Education); Notable Trade Book (Council for the Social Studies/Children's Book Council); and Orbis Pictus Honor Award for Outstanding Nonfiction ( National Council of Teachers of English.)

Her book, Rosie the Riveter: Working on the Home Front in World War II (Crown, 1995), was reviewed by the New York Times Book Review: ""Penny Colman's engaging book...enlivened and authenticated by quotations from women who talk about their wartime experiences.""

0-8166-3312-6,Screen Style: Fashion and Femininity in 1930s Hollywood,"Berry, Sarah",Univ Of Minnesota Press,256,2/4/2000,,Hardcover,"A vividly illustrated social history of 1930s film and fashion.<br>
<br>
Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich-all were icons of beauty and glamour in 1930s Hollywood. Screen Style reveals the impact of celebrities like these on women filmgoers, looking beyond the surface of the films and fashions of the era-often described as forms of escapism from the difficult realities of the Depression-to show how Hollywood presented women with models for self-determination during a time of rapid social change. <br>
<br>
Revealing the fascination of Hollywood movies in the thirties with strong-willed women-from the ambitions of gold-diggers, working girls, and social climbers to the illicit appeal of female androgyny and ethnic exoticism-Sarah Berry presents a lively, accessible, and lavishly illustrated look at films, fan magazines, and advertising. She views Hollywood glamour in the context of popular debates about fashion, identity, and social status, discussing such films as What Price Hollywood?, The Bride Wore Red, and The Bitter Tea of General Yen; big-budget, style-driven vehicles such as Fashions of 1934 and Vogues of 1938; and musicals, costume dramas, and Technicolor extravaganzas. <br>
<br>
Screen Style explores the consumer economy that was still a novelty in the 1930s, as well as the shift from ""class"" to ""mass"" fashion marketing. Berry analyzes Hollywood and fashion-industry perceptions of the huge potential buying power of women, both as purchasers of goods for the entire family and as filmgoers, and the subsequent boom in star endorsements and merchandising, fashion publicity for upcoming films, and movie tie-ins of clothes and accessories. Wide-ranging changes accompanied the popularization of fashion, including the growing acceptance of cosmetic use and women's appropriation of pants. The fact that more women than ever before were working outside of the home led to a blurring of the social distinctions that fashion had traditionally served to accentuate-and, as a result, popular fashion provided women with a new tool to challenge and shape their roles in society. <br>

Everything conspires against the single, childless man. Each new living thing in the world each day says: You are alone, and not getting younger.<br>
<br>
At the age of thirty-seven, the journalist and novelist Jesse Green found his life dramatically changing when he met and fell in love with a man who had recently adopted a baby boy. Having long since made peace with his choice not to be a parent, Green now faced the shock and the responsibility of a fatherhood he had never imagined. The Velveteen Father is his candid, heartfelt, and often hilarious account of the formation and flourishing of a family.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In intimate, graceful prose, Green describes his partner's journey from the hedonistic eighties to the realization that he wanted to have a child; his own concurrent journey to find a way to become an adult without having a child; and their journey together to become good parents in a society whose reactions to unconventional families can be both funny and frightening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In the classic bedtime story, a velveteen rabbit is made real at last by a child's true love. <i>The Velveteen FatherM</i> is a moving record of the transformative effect parenthood can have on people who least expect to become parents, of how we are repeatedly made anew by the love of children who need us. But this transformation is not just the province of parents, Green writes; only by addressing, in some way, the generations that come before and after us can we face the task of becoming real.

<p>After you meet Mr. Right, at some point in the relationship you will both say, ""I love you."" What do you mean when you say, ""I love you""? What does he mean when he says, ""I love you""? What does anyone mean when he says it? Love is a word we have all used at one time or another, but it is also a word that carries many meanings.</p>
<p>I have asked hundreds of gay men, ""What is love?"" and there has been no shared or agreed-upon answer. Even lovers have different answers. When I ask male couples who are experiencing major problems why they are staying together, they usually say, ""Because we love each other."" This answer doesn't tell me much.</p>
<p>What does love mean to you? Your answer is important and may help you understand your past, present, and future relationships. It may also help you figure out why you may have trouble forming and developing long-term relationships.</p>
<p class=""null1"">What You May Have Learned About Love</p>
<p>As a child, you learned that if you were really good, your mother said, ""I love you."" If you were punished for being bad, you may have been told, ""Mommy still loves you."" Early in life you learned what you needed to do to be loved. You conformed to your parents' expectations, which guaranteed your parents' love and protection. You believed you wouldn't be abandoned if you met their expectations. You believed you were safe if you were loved. As a child, you tested your parents' love and their limits. You placed demands on them to make sure they continued to love you. You learned from your parents about love.</p>
<p>As an adolescent, you learned about love from television, movies, and friends. You found yourself attracted to someone, and you were told you were in love. You may have also been told this was puppy love or adolescent love and that it would not last long. You saw sexual intimacy and were then told this was love. You learned the word love and associated it with various definitions.</p>
<p>Love has different meanings for different people, which makes it almost impossible to know how the word is being used by anyone. Some of the following expressions are just a few uses of the word love:</p>

Only via Trinidad will Chatty Cathy enter a villanelle, or Garbo's troll collection find itself unveiled in terza rima. Yet Trinidad's high/low playfulness thoroughly displays a smart, sharp art of arrangement--be the subject Fat Liz / Bad Anne; Barbie, Ken, Midge, Allan, and Skipper; Marilyn Monroe's psyche; or 116 lines cribbed from everyone from Matthew Arnold to JamesWright. The book masterfully renders the obsessive aspects of popular culture-collectibility, relentless camp, larger-than-life power dynamics-and the odd way they reflect the poignant complexities of making choices. This is plainly evident in the many shorter poems on the vicissitudes of collecting, like Accessories (comb,/ brush and `real' mirror) or Fortunes (You are just beginning to live), and in Essay with Movable Parts, a long poem that intersperses images of the poet's nascent doll collection with subversively intelligent snapshots from a range of cheesy classics, including Valley of the Dolls and episodes of Gilligan's Island. A second long poem, Every Night, Byron is written from the perspective of the poet's lover's dog, hilariously summoning up The Autobiogrpahy of Alice B.

This is Trinidad's finest work to date, and readers will do well to take refuge in its shiny, humane splendors, even if doubting the value of disposable culture in and of itself. (Mar.)

1-56085-130-9,Dancing Naked: A Novel,"Van Wagoner, Robert H.",Signature Books,372,7/15/1999,,Hardcover,"Terry Walker is an even-tempered, successful mathematics professor, comfortable with his world-the order and predictability of it. He likes the kind of life one lives in a quiet Salt Lake City subdivision. At his children's births, he masks his terror with numbers-his wife's contractions and dilations, blood pressure, heart rate. At funerals he absorbs his grief by calculating the cubic feet of earth the coffin and vault will displace. 
<p>But control is illusive, something his fifteen-year-old son Blake never lets him forget. A sensitive boy, Blake has refused to eat meat since the time he could walk. Fearing he will hurt his friends' feelings, Blake withdraws from a spelling bee that he could easily win. More importantly, however, Blake harbors a secret that he keeps from Terry.</p>
<p>Driving this important first novel are issues and characters Thomas Mann himself would have found compelling. Terry Walker's inability to accept what he knows and does not know about his child, what he possibly could never accept, exacts a high price. Almost at the threshold of insanity, the father begins waging a war against a powerful chaos. Van Wagoner takes his readers beyond a simple foretelling of what happens in such situations to deep beneath the story's skin, to a place readers will find familiar and perhaps even irresistible.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.36 Pounds, Width: 1.9 Inches",10,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/01/9781560851301.jpg,Success,69,22.6

<p>""It's about time you decided to wake up! We have a brunch at one o'clock, as you very well know.""</p>
<p>Gary was up, dressed, sitting across the room sipping coffee and smoking a cigarillo. He'd been out: the Sunday <i>Times</i> sat unopened on a nearby chair.</p>
<p>""It's almost twelve now. A cab will take at least fifteen minutes. If we can find one. Go shower. You know you take forever in there.""</p>
<p>Behind Gary's head, sunlight came in through the skylighted dressing room and pushed through the flecked fibers of the shoji-screen. Spence could see the gold flecking on the rice paper very clearly today. The undulating fields of lacquered flowers were backlighted—bright as persimmons—Gary's face was in shadow.</p>
<p>""I want you to know beforehand that this brunch is extremely important to me. Arnie has invited Seitelman, the Oriental Art expert. I've been trying to get near him for months. I want him to come look at those <i>Monoyamo</i> scrolls I picked up last month.""</p>
<p>Gary exhaled blue smoke. It floated into the sunlight, turned grey then yellow then grey again. He exhaled again and a second cloud rose to meet the first in a billow. It spread thinly, forming a tiny tornado around the head of the smiling Shinto statue precariously perched on a wall shelf. The Shinto idol kept smiling; it never seemed to notice the smoke descend again and form a flat halo directly over Gary's head. Spence noticed though. He laughed.</p>
<p>""I'm not kidding, Spence. Arnie's gone to a lot of trouble to get Seitelman. And it will take a lot of tact to keep him there. So I don't want any interference from you. Is that clear?""</p>
<p>Gary exhaledforcefully and broke the halo. He began picking at the edge of the cup he was drinking from as though it were crusted with something. It was his favorite china—from the Northern Sung—and invaluable. Spence never touched it. He only used china that could be dropped: or thrown. Gary frowned. Spence turned over in bed.</p>
<p>""As soon as you've met him, go to the other end of the room or table or wherever we are. And stay there. And, Spence, do try to keep your pin-sized knowledge of art to yourself. No one is interested, I assure you.""</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/24/9781555835224.jpg,Success,69,22.6

This moving anniversary volume, drawn partly from the house's backlist, contains skillfully drawn excerpts from many noteworthy longer works. A pantheon of girls abide here: city and country girls, sassy daddy's and mama's girls, girls trying to assimilate at home, school or summer camp, girls with crushes on girls, girls striving to be boys, girls desperately avoiding marriage and others convinced that ""only a man's love can save me and make me human again."" Though threaded with familiar themes of the onset of womanhood and the first flickerings of sexual awareness, there are other awakenings in these tales: the discovery of books and reading; sudden, headlong slides into rebellion against parents or teachers; and a dawning understanding of the power of money. The straightforward, unsentimental fictional voices of Jo Sinclair's 1950s tomboy, Vincent; Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's stoic heroine, Louisa; and Toni Cade Bambara's cocky and fleet-footed Squeaky, who always wins the 50-yard dash, complement the compelling real-life remembrances of such authors as Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker and Toni McNaron, whose 1992 memoir, I Dwell in Possibility, is excerpted here. Even the occasionally mawkish or dated piece provides an intriguing look at girls' inner lives. But those few false notes are outweighed by a number of beautifully quiet insights about the struggle to grow up.

Into this world comes sixteen-year-old Rachel, a young woman who loves the round symmetries of Latin verse and the melancholy beauty of the Somerset countryside. Rachel is drawn into the conflict between two of the school's powerful figures. On one side is the formidable headmistress, who preaches the virtues of self-control while inviting teachers into her room at night. On the other side is Rachel's classmate Margaret, who openly despises Bampfield, urges Rachel to read <i>The Well of Loneliness</i> and sneaks out for trysts with her beautiful friend Rena.

1-55861-237-8,Life Prints: A Memoir of Healing and Discovery (The Cross-Cultural Memoir Series),"Grimley Mason, Mary",The Feminist Press at CUNY,240,6/1/2000,,Hardcover,"<p>When she is six, Mary Grimley is the nation's first ""poster child,"" dining with President Roosevelt at the Warm Springs rehabilitation center and posing in her wheelchair for publicity shots. But a close look at photos reveals something other than the ""cheerful invalid"" that the abled expect: mouth closed in a frown, eyes defiant and proud, this bold child is less than impressed with the label of ""poor crippled girl.""</p>
<p>As a brilliant young scholar in the 1950s and 1960s, Mary Grimley Mason refuses to focus on her disability and instead makes herself privy to a revolution of ideas. At Radcliffe College and in graduate school at the University of Chicago and Harvard, she surrounds herself with writers and thinkers, plunging into the bohemian lifestyle of Cambridge cooperatives and radical intellectualism. But inchoate concepts of ""normalcy"" soon twist Mason's path, and she finds herself married to another scholar, supporting his studies, keeping house, and raising children. Even during several years in Paris, she is positioned to overhear rather than participate in conversations with scholars and writers such as Louis Massignon. Years of conflict result in a difficult realization: she has laid aside her own dream to become the dream of another-""the perfect wife of a writer,"" as Frank O'Connor predicted.</p>
<p>Mason has spent her life struggling against prejudice toward disabled people; now she has discovered an even more formidable enemy: the sexism of mentors, friends, family, and even herself. But she will find the courage to contend with both of the forces that seek to define and limit her. After undergoing years of physical therapy and social isolation, after forcing the strictures of disability behind her, she at last accepts her identity as a disabled person, abandoning ""that double in my life-that consciousness or voice that tried to pass as able-bodied."" At the same time, she moves beyond the limitations society has prescribed for women, embracing feminism-and discovering her life's work. Specializing academically in women's autobiography, Mary Grimley Mason is unusually well-suited to narrate and interpret her own life, taking control of its representation with forthright determination.

The Little Locksmith begins in 1895 when a specialist straps five-year-old Katharine, then suffering from spinal tuberculosis, to a board with halters and pulleys in a failed attempt to prevent her being a ""hunchback."" Her mother says that she should be thankful that her parents are able to have her cared for by a famous surgeon; otherwise, she would grow up to be like the ""little locksmith,"" who does jobs at their home; he has a ""strange, awful peak in his back."" Forced to endure ""a horizontal life of night and day,"" Katharine remains immobile until age fifteen, only to find that she, too, has a hunched back and is ""no larger than a ten-year-old child."" The Little Locksmith charts Katharine's struggle to transcend physical limitations and embrace her life, her body and herself in the face of debilitating bouts of frustration and shame. Her spirit and courage prevail, and she succeeds in expanding her world far beyond the boundaries prescribed by her family and society: she attends Radcliffe College, forms deep friendships, begins to write, and in 1921, purchases a house of her own in Castine, Maine. There she creates her home, room by room, fashioning it as a space for guests, lovers, and artists. <i>The Little Locksmith</i> stands as a testimony to Katharine's aspirations and desires-for independence, for love, and for the pursuit of her art.</p>
<p>""We tend to forget nowadays that there is more than one variety of hero (and heroine). Katharine Butler Hathaway, who died last Christmas Eve, was the kind of heroine whose deeds are rarely chronicled. They were not spectacular and no medal would have been appropriate for her. All she did was to take a life which fate had cast in the mold of a frightful tragedy and redesign it into a quiet, modest work of art. The life was her own.</p>

1-55861-241-6,The Politics of Women's Studies: Testimony from the 30 Founding Mothers (The Women's Studies History Series),,The Feminist Press at CUNY,440,8/1/2000,,Paperback,"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the patriarchal halls of 1970s academe, women who spoke their minds risked their careers. Yet intrepid women—students, faculty, administrators, members of the community—persisted in collaborating to form women's studies. In doing so, they created a movement that altered curricula and teaching styles, and shifted paradigms and content across disciplines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These original essays by ""founding mothers"" feature a diversity of voices: young graduate students or new Ph.D.s just beginning to teach and untenured; tenured professors in search of ways to improve their students' capacities to learn; older, veteran academics at last witnessing change; and even a few administrators. During the early years, they taught at more than 30 campuses, many changing jobs several times. Some taught at private institutions such as Spelman College and Cornell University, while the majority taught at large state universities such as Berkeley, Michigan, Kentucky, Arizona, and the City University of New York. In all of these programs, founders grappled not only with issues of gender, but with those of class, race, and sexuality, in a decade infused with political unrest and questioning, when civil rights and antiwar activism, as well as feminism, shaped academic worlds. In engaging political memoir, these essays chronicle the exhilaration of building a new kind of institution, of constructing a new curriculum and unearthing a new body of knowledge. They also give voice to the pain of successive defeats in the face of sexist attitudes and structures. Few of these trailblazers were welcomed as agents of change, fewer still applauded for their work. Yet their stories remain both inspiring and instructive. While each of these women's narratives has a life of its own, collectively, they tell an even more powerful story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first volume in the Women's Studies History series, <i>The Politics of Women's Studies</i> preserves an essential history that is in danger of sinking into obscurity, combatting the amnesia afflicting many of those teaching and studying about women today. <i>The Politics of Women's Studies</i> includes essays by: Electa Arenal, Gloria Bowles, Marilyn J.

<p>THE MOUNTAIN</p>
<p>I: A Metaphor</p>
<p>The mountain as metaphor looms large in the lives of marginalized people, people whose bones get crushed in the grind of capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy. How many of us have struggled up the mountain, measured ourselves against the mountain, failed on the mountain, lived in the shadow of the mountain, hit our heads on glass ceilings, tried to climb the class ladder, lost the fight against assimilation, struggled our way toward that phantom called normality?</p>
<p>We hear from the summit that the world is the best from up there. Hear that we are lazy, stupid, weak, ugly, that we live at the bottom precisely because we are those things. We decide to climb that mountain, or make a pact that our children will climb it. The climbing turns out to be unimaginably difficult. We are afraid; every time we look ahead we can find nothing remotely familiar or comfortable. We lose the trail. Our wheelchairs get stuck. We speak the wrong languages with the wrong accents, wear the wrong clothes, carry our bodies the wrong ways, ask the wrong questions, love the wrong people. And it's goddamn lonely up there on the mountain. We decide to stop climbing and build a new house right where we are. Or we decide to climb back down to the people we love where the food, the clothes, the dirt, the sidewalk, the steaming asphalt under our feet, our crutches all feel right. Or we find the path again, decide to continue climbing only to have the very people who told us how wonderful life is at the summit booby trap the trail. They burn the bridge over the impassable canyon. They redraw our topo maps so that we end up walking in circles. They send their goons-those working-class and poor people they employ as their official brutes-to push us over the edge. Maybe we get to the summit but p</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",14,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/50/9780896086050.jpg,Success,96,22.6

A member of the only black family in a predominantly Scandinavian and Irish region of rural Minnesota, her politics were sculpted both by the African American newspapers that arrived at her doorstep in brown paper wrappings, and by the insatiable drive and steadfast values that she acquired on her family's farm.

1-85649-682-1,"Women, Work and Islamism: Ideology and Resistance in Iran","Rostami-Povey, Elaheh",Zed Books,208,8/1/1999,,Paperback,"This book explores Islamism in practice and looks at the influence of state, economy and religion on women in Iran. Drawing on original research into women's participation in the work force, the author shows how the Islamization of state and society which followed the 1979 revolution involved an attempt by the Islamic state to seclude women within the home. Its power to transform gender relations, however, was constrained by many factors--the Iran-Iraq war, economic restructuring, and women's varied responses to oppression. In 1999, women's participation in the labor force is greater than it was before the revolution, and gender consciousness is at a higher level than at the height of westernization in the 1960s and 70s.<br>",en,,"Height: 7.8200631 Inches, Length: 5.1999896 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",32,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/27/9781856496827.jpg,Success,99,22.6

1-55597-294-2,Northern Waters,"Grover, Jan Zita",Graywolf Press,236,9/1/1999,,Paperback,"<p><P>Jan Zita Grover brings to her writing on fly fishing a fresh eye, a lyric prose style and an original and thoughtful take on the world, a combination of talents that makes <i>Northern Waters</i> one of the most engaging books on rivers, woods, and fishing I've read in a good long while.&#151;W.D. Wetherell, author of <i>One River More</i><P>Grover came to angling late and seems hell-bent on making up for lost time. But <i>Northern Waters</i> is more than just a fishing memoir. It's the chronicle of a woman profoundly and passionately engaged in the natural world. With intelligence, clarity, and considerable literary skill, Grover reminds us that the world is richer than we supposed, more complex, more fertile, more surprising&#151;and that it's time we rolled up our sleeves and got down to the messy business of being alive.&#151;Jerry Dennis, author of <i>The River Home</i><P><i>Northern Waters</i> is my favorite kind of fishing book&#58; part memoir, part history, and all engaging commentary on what makes fishermen the way we are. It is also a splendid celebration of the north woods and their often imperiled magic.&#151;Paul Schullery, author of <i>Royal Coachman</i><P>Many of us have, as Jan Zita Grover writes, submitted ourselves 'to the tutelage of waters.' But few pupils have proved so adept. Grover is a writer of uncommon gifts, as deft and graceful as she is tough-minded.&#151;Ted Leeson, co-author of <i>The Fly Tier's Benchside Reference</i><P><b>Jan Zita Grover</b> is a transplanted San Franciscan now happily living in northern Minnesota. She is also the author of <i>North Enough&#58; AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts</i>.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Though ostensibly about fly-fishing, this book never talks about catching fish; it is instead a detailed examination of the Midwest--written by a native Californian. Although not a spectacular writer, Grover (North Enough: AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts) does have a keen eye for nature and our impact on the environment. (The waters Grover writes about--in the north woods of Minnesota and Wisconsin--have been familiar to me for 25 years, but she surprised me with her observations.) These challenging essays primarily explore an angler's engagement with the natural world, but they also take on Great Lakes salmon stocking, lampreys, dams, and fishing in Montana (which Midwestern anglers regard as our reward for surviving our winters). Many fly-fishing converts have been driven to write about the sport; few have succeeded as well as Grover. Although there are a few glaring factual errors, this is for the most part a thought-provoking work.

In The Free Thinkers: Two Novellas, she gives these lost lives a new voice, recovering in exacting detail the world of newly arrived Eastern European Jews in turn-of-the-century-America. Silbert's stories chronicle their arrival in Chicago and New York, and follow them as they trade Yiddish and Russian for English, find work in factories and Jewish newspapers, attend Zionist meetings, and struggle toward the promise of freedom and happiness.<br>
The Free Thinkers tells two tales. The first novella focuses on Ida, an independent woman, a ""freethinker"" devoted to finding her own way in America. A factory forelady, a patron of the theater, and an instinctive feminist, she is determined to find total freedom in a man's world-no matter where it leads her.<br>
The collection's other novella chronicles the lives of three sisters from the Ukraine as they find husbands and start their own families in America. Two masterful chapters at the heart of the novella describe their mother's arrival, after the great war and the revolution, to a small Indiana town. She is ""a vision, in her clothes, her posture, the very air around her, a vision of a sight on a street in the village they'd all come from, suddenly seamlessly transported into this pleasant spring morning to the very middle of America.""<br>
In Layle Silbert's tender Stories of the New World, as in the best stories of Chekov, the slightest gesture carries with it the weight of the world. Nothing happens, everything happens. Silbert's writing is delicate, as if dusted by the wings of a visiting angel, here to present for posterity the way things were.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.31 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.322773572 Pounds, Width: 1.14 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/52/9781583220252.jpg,Success,100,22.6

Set against the backdrop of bloody Carthage, the novel celebrates one woman s attempt to transcend history.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Writing becomes weapon and refuge for the oppressed in this fiercely intelligent, intricate novel set in a tragic, bewitching Algeria. Expressing the bitterness of being caught between traditional Islamic and modern European cultures, married 36-year-old Isma begins her story the summer she has an affair with a student. A highly educated musicologist, Isma is also governed by Islamic tradition. When her husband, Leo, discovers her dalliance, he beats her, intending to blind her. The affair marks Isma's awakening and the beginning of her quest for true independence, though she stays with her husband for a little while longer. When she finally leaves him, she embarks on a semi-documentary film project, to be called Arable Women. Intertwining her experiences in the mountains filming peasant women with memories of her childhood and stories about her female ancestors and relatives, Isma weaves a complicated tapestry of images and sentiments. The tales she unearths are richly detailed and gracefully told, and the book becomes a moving common history of cultural exile and captivity. Djebar, winner of the 1996 Neustadt Prize for Contributions to World Literature, has a talent for narrating the stories of those who are freed and voiceless without heavy-handed moralizing or judgment.

1-58322-014-3,I Remain in Darkness,Annie Ernaux,Seven Stories Press,94,1999-12,,Hardcover,"<p>Written in journal form, Annie Ernaux's account of her mother's steady decline spans a period of nearly three years. When her mother first becomes ill, Ernaux takes her in. Soon, it becomes painfully obvious that professional help is needed. Diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, her mother enters a nursing home, never to leave. As it explores the complexities of death and parent-child role reversal, Ernaux's latest work takes its place on the shelf beside John Bayley's Elegy for Iris and Roger Kamenetz's Terra Infirma. ""As revealed by Ernaux, the details of a loved one's deterioration have such emblematic force and terror that the particular becomes universal."" - The New York Times Book Review</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Unlike Aaron Alterra's The Caregiver (LJ 10/15/99), this slim volume by noted French writer Ernaux (Simple Passion) is not a straightforward medical account of her mother's death from Alzheimer's; instead, it is a collection of the notes, in their original form, that Ernaux jotted down at the time of her mother's illness. ""When I write down all these things, I scribble away as fast as I can (as if I felt guilty), without choosing my words."" Here in their raw, uncensored form are the ""vestiges of pain""--the anger, guilt, and grief that Ernaux felt during her mother's two-year decline. Here are the graphic images of her once-powerful mother wearing diapers, the woman in the next bed peeing on the floor, a drawer in the bedside table filled with a human turd. Because the notes have not been edited, there is a choppy, unpolished feel to the book, which is perhaps Ernaux's intention--as a possible counterpoint to A Woman's Story (1991), her fictionalized memoir of her mother's life and death.

0-8264-1184-3,The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory,"Adams, Carol J.",Continuum Intl Pub Group,272,1999,,Paperback,"<p class=""null1"">First published in 1990, <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i> is a landmark text in the ongoing debates about animal rights. In the two decades since, the book has inspired controversy and heated debate.</p>
<p><i>T</i> <i>he Sexual Politics of Meat</i> argues that what, or more precisely who, we eat is determined by the patriarchal politics of our culture, and that the meanings attached to meat eating are often clustered around virility. We live in a world in which men still have considerable power over women, both in public and in private. Carol Adams argues that gender politics is inextricably related to how we view animals, especially animals who are consumed. Further, she argues that vegetarianism and fighting for animal rights fit perfectly alongside working to improve the lives of disenfranchised and suffering people, under the wide umbrella of compassionate activism.</p>
<p>This 20th Anniversary Edition includes a new preface by the author, discussing new developments in the field and answering some of her critics. It also features an introduction by Nellie McKay. If you have never read <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat,</i> prepare to have your worldview challenged — and possibly turned upside down — like tens of thousands of readers before you.</p>
<p class=""null1"">Praise for <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i>:</p>
<p>""A bible of the vegan community."" <i>—The New York Times</i></p>
<p>""Her argument is rational and persuasive....New ground - whole acres of it - is broken by Adams."" <i>—Washington Post Book World</i></p>
<p>""Read this powerful new book and you may well become a vegetarian."" <i>—Ms. Magazine</i></p>
<p>""Both thoughtful and thought-provoking."" —Kirkus Reviews</p>
<p>""Likely to both inspire and enrage readers across the political spectrum."" <i>—Library Journal</i></p>
<p>""Carol J. Adams's original, provocative book makes a major contribution to the debate on animal rights."" <i>—Publisher's Weekly</i></p>
<p><b>CAROL J. ADAMS</b> is the author of <i>The Pornography of Meat</i> (Continuum, 2004), and co-author of <i>Beyond Animal Rights</i> (Continuum, 2000), and <i>The Bedside, Bathtub, and Armchair Companion to Jane Austen</i> (Continuum, 2008). She has toured as a speaker throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. More information can be found at her website: http://www.triroc.com/caroladams</p>


                        <p>In just over a year, the book with the strange title--and even strager ideas, some would say--has become the classic articulation of the hidden connections between meat eating and patriarchy, between vegetarianism and feminism. Now in paperback and widely available to readers everywhere, The Sexual Politics of Meat will have an even larger impact on the American public.

What was your mother's experience when she had you? Do you long for a deeper bond with your loved ones? In <i>Reclaiming the Spirituality of Birth</i>, Benig Mauger suggests that our prenatal and birth experiences affect us for the rest of our lives. And because our modern approach to birth separates mothers from their primordial knowledge of natural delivery, many people suffer from lifelong birth wounds. Mauger invites women to reclaim the connection to their own instinctive, intuitive, and inherently spiritual creative powers. <p>The West's rational, mechanistic worldview wreaks havoc with the birth experience as it leads to ever increasing levels of high-tech medical intervention. Induced labor, fetal monitors, and pain-killing drugs alter the natural rhythms of delivery. This scientific approach puts medical personnel in control of the birth process, leaving mothers and their babies with a profound sense of loss. Drawing on her experience as a birth teacher, therapist, and mother, Benig Mauger suggests that by reconnecting with the natural and spiritual world an expectant mother can make the birth experience her own, thereby healing old wounds and allowing herself both a deeply satisfying delivery and an abiding spiritual connection to her child. <p>Benig Mauger founded the Holistic Birth Centre in London in the 1980s and has an extensive background in childbirth education.

The twenty-seven-year old women's studies major at San Diego State University was the director of the campus Women's Resource Center and a self-defense instructor. Nevertheless, in the early morning hours of November 5, 1994, she was brutally murdered in the apartment that she had shared with her boyfriend, Andres English-Howard. Days later, English-Howard was arrested on suspicion of murder. In August 1995, he was convicted of first-degree murder. The night before he was scheduled to appear in court for sentencing, English-Howard hanged himself in his jail cell.
<p>By all standard definitions, O'Donnell was not victim. She was self-assured, strong-willed, a feminist. Yet, she became a victim. If it could happen to her, her friends feared, it could happen to anybody. Author Kathleen B. Jones, one of O'Donnell's professors, was particularly shaken by her death. In Living Between Danger and Love, she examines O'Donnell's death and what it has to say to all of us.</p>
<p>Grafting memoir with autobiography, Jones recounts riveting episodes in her own life that parallel O'Donnell's. Adding to these memories, she narrates crises faced by others she has come to know who shared stories of domestic violence. What emerges is a complex, hybrid tale of what Jones calls ""unreasonable choices"" - the kinds of choices that most of us feel we are expected to make between love and power, between care for another and care for ourselves. She provokes readers to consider the irony that our ideas about choice might prevent us from imagining and discovering social relationships of intimacy where love and power are not in conflict.</p>",en,56307th,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/44/9780813527444.jpg,Success,109,22.6

In A Feminist I Christine Overall offers wide-ranging reflections from a first-person point of view on these issues, and on the politics of the modern university itself. In doing so she continually returns to underlying epistemological concerns. What are our assumptions about the ways in which knowledge is constructed? To what degree are our perceptions shaped by our social roles and identities? In the past generation feminists have led the way in recognising the importance of such questions, and recognising too the ways in which personal experience may be an invaluable reference point in academic theory and practice. But reliance on personal experience is fraught with problems; how is one to deal with tensions between the autobiographical and the analytic? This book points the way to resolving some of those tensions, and to fruitfully sustaining others.

For some, feminism is the favorite scapegoat for multiple social ills; for others, the greatest success story of the closing century. The Janus face of feminism in the media reflects the competing images of women's lives today. Feminists themselves hold sharply opposing views on the success or failures of three decades of women's activism. <i>Why Feminism?</i> looks at the shifts in feminist thinking from the brash emergence of Women's Liberation at the close of the 1960s to the diverse and discordant feminisms of recent decades. Exploring feminism's troubled relations with psychology and psychoanalysis, the rise of new evolutionary theory, the impact of queer theorizing on gender categories, controversies over memory and trauma, and increasing anxieties about men and masculinity, <i>Why Feminism?</i> illustrates the continuing provocation and significance of feminist inquiry, laying out potentialities and pitfalls for the century ahead.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>",en,0,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",26,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/58/9780231119658.jpg,Success,110,22.6

In the face of a centuries-old tradition of a male priesthood, what are the implications for the Catholic church of ordaining women? Would women priests become co-opted into the male clerical caste, particularly in relation to celebrating the sacraments? In an analysis that deftly unites feminist criticism, psychoanalysis, and Catholic theology, Kelley A. Raab explores the symbolic implications of women at the altar, providing rich insight into issues of gender, symbolism, and power.</p><p><i>When Women Become Priests</i> addresses critical issues about the effect of a female priest on the parishioners she would serve, on the sacrament of communion, and on the significance of the symbolism of Jesus that priest maintain during certain ceremonies. Rooted in her firm belief in the place of women within the Catholic priesthood, Raab's work is one that -- rather than reducing religious convictions to psychological construct -- seeks to re-invigorate these convictions for the contemporary world.</p><p>Supported by interviews with women in the Episcopal priesthood (which has ordained women since 1977), Raab draws upon object-relations theory, Freudian concepts of the unconscious, and French feminist thinkers Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray to show how the celebration of mass by women priests would require a constructive reenvisioning of core dimensions of Catholic theology.</p>",en,0,"Height: 8.96 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.98 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/59/9780231113359.jpg,Success,110,22.6

0-231-11580-6,Critical Condition,"Gubar, Susan",Columbia University Press,256,2/15/2000,,Hardcover,"<p>Is feminism dead, as has been claimed by notable members of the media and the academy? Has feminist knowledge, with its proliferation of methodologies and fields, been purchased at the price of power? Are the conflicts among feminists evidence of self-destructive infighting or do they herald the emergence of innovative modes of inquiry? Given a feminism now ensconced within higher education as specialized or fractious scholarship, Susan Gubar's <i>Critical Condition: Feminism at the Turn of the Century</i> demonstrates that an invigorated concentration on activism and artistry can accentuate not the clinical or disparaging meaning of ""critical"" but its sense of compelling urgency and irreverent vitality.</p>
<p>As a pioneer of feminist studies -- and the object of some of the more rancorous criticism lodged against early feminist scholars -- Gubar stands in a unique position to comment on current dilemmas. Moving beyond defensiveness produced by generational rivalry, the impasse propagated by smug deployments of identity politics, and the obscurity of poststructuralist theory, she claims that the very controversies that undermine feminism's unity also prove its resilience.</p>
<p>Gubar begins by considering the volatile impact of gender on recent redefinitions of race, sexuality, religion, and class proposed by four important groups in contemporary feminism: African-American performance and visual artists, lesbian creative writers, Jewish-American women, and newly institutionalized female academics. She then addresses major divisions -- including the rifts between various area studies and women's studies, as well as strains between generations -- that both threaten and invigorate feminist inquiry. Gubar's forays into art and activism, politics, and the profession provide a sometimes distressing, sometimes comical, sometimes optimistic view of feminism emerging from a time of contention into a lively period of pluralized perspectives and disciplines.</p>

A champion of civil rights and racial justice and an advocate for the poor and disenfranchised, Pauley's tenacity as an activist and the length of her career are remarkable. She is also a consummate storyteller; for decades, she has shared her words with activists, students, and scholars who have found their way to her door.</p>
<p>Kathryn L. Nasstrom uses rich oral history material, recorded by herself and others, to present Frances Pauley in her own words. Pauley's life has encompassed much of the last century of extraordinary social change in the South, a life touching and touched by famous figures from southern politics and the civil rights movement. Highlights of Pauley's career in the public eye include a friendship with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King, encounters with several of Georgia's civil-rights-era governors, and a meeting with Eleanor Roosevelt. A skillful political organizer, Pauley was involved in decades of community mobilization, repeated efforts to educate politicians and the public about the origins and nature of poverty, and lobbying for unpopular causes. ""People are born into a certain way of living,"" she says. ""It takes a jolt to get out of it. It doesn't really mean that they're all that mean and bad, but it takes a jolt to make them see that maybe they could make a change.""</p>
<p>In a deft blend of biography and memoir, Nasstrom explains Pauley's historical significance and places her story in the context of developments in Georgia politics and the civil rights movement. Even as it contributes to the political history of Georgia and the South, affording insight of unusual depth on familiar issues and events, the book preserves one woman's story in the still largely undocumented history of southern women's social and political activism in the twentieth century. Pauley's experiences serve as a window on the lives of all those women and men who, town by town and state by state, made momentous change not only possible but also inescapable.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/23/9780801437823.jpg,Success,111,22.6

0-8223-2422-9,Queer Diasporas (Series Q),Marcie Frank,Duke University Press Books,320,7/24/2000,,Paperback,"<i>Queer Diasporas</i> presents essays that explore how sexuality and sexual identity change when individuals, ideologies, and media move across literal and figurative boundaries. Speaking from a diverse range of ethnic, racial, and national sites, the contributors to this volume illustrate how queer identity in particular is affected in ways that are as varied and nuanced as the cultural, social, and physical environments themselves.
<p>Incorporating literary analysis, ethnographic research, and theories of diaspora, migration, and transnationalism, the essays in this volume address an impressive range of topics, from the divergent medical and epidemiological understandings of the AIDS pandemic to 1950s lesbian pulp fiction. While one chapter focuses on the appropriation of religious ceremony by gay Filipino immigrants in New York City, another investigates the implicit connection between Jewishness and homosexuality in the work of Freud. The gendering of domestic roles in food preparation and consumption in Japanese society gives way to a discussion of Cuban and Jamaican homoeroticism as seen in the works of Reinaldo Arenas and Claude McKay. Chilean author D’Halmar’s orientalization of Spain as queer space and the hybrid nature of queer ‘zine culture in Quebec are the subject of others. The collection concludes with a monologue by “Walid,” a young gay Arab living in the occupied territory, whose sexual and national identities change according to his sexual and social needs.</p>
<p> Illuminating the complex nature of queerness in the postmodern world, <i>Queer Diasporas</i> contributes to the advancement of gay and lesbian studies. It will be important to those working in cultural, literary, and postcolonial studies.</p>",en,New Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.38009376012 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/25/9780822324225.jpg,Success,111,22.6

0-8223-2443-1,Queering the Color Line: Race and the Invention of Homosexuality in American Culture (Series Q),"Somerville, Siobhan B.",Duke University Press Books,272,1/13/2000,,Paperback,"<p><i>Queering the Color Line</i> transforms previous understandings of how homosexuality was “invented” as a category of identity in the United States beginning in the late nineteenth century. Analyzing a range of sources, including sexology texts, early cinema, and African American literature, Siobhan B. Somerville argues that the emerging understanding of homosexuality depended on the context of the black/white “color line,” the dominant system of racial distinction during this period. This book thus critiques and revises tendencies to treat race and sexuality as unrelated categories of analysis, showing instead that race has historically been central to the cultural production of homosexuality.<br>
	At about the same time that the 1896 Supreme Court <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> decision hardened the racialized boundary between black and white, prominent trials were drawing the public’s attention to emerging categories of sexual identity. Somerville argues that these concurrent developments were not merely parallel but in fact inextricably interrelated and that the discourses of racial and sexual “deviance” were used to reinforce each other’s terms. She provides original readings of such texts as Havelock Ellis’s late nineteenth-century work on “sexual inversion,” the 1914 film <i>A Florida Enchantment</i>, the novels of Pauline E. Hopkins, James Weldon Johnson’s <i>Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man</i>, and Jean Toomer’s fiction and autobiographical writings, including <i>Cane</i>. Through her analyses of these texts and her archival research, Somerville contributes to the growing body of scholarship that focuses on discovering the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality.<br>

In chapters that range from the changing structure of the American family and its impact on both curriculum and university benefits policies to recommendations for overhauling the culture of decision making on campus, this former Dean of the College of Humanities at the University of Arizona explores the present state of higher education and offers a sobering view of what lies ahead.<br>In this volume Kolodny explains the reasons for the financial crisis in higher education today and boldly addresses the challenges that remain ignored, including rising birthrates, changing demographics both on campus and across the country, the accelerating globalization of higher education and advanced research, and the necessity for greater interdisciplinarity in undergraduate education. Moreover, while sensitive to the complex burdens placed on faculty today, Kolodny nonetheless reveals how the professoriate has allowed itself to become vulnerable to public misperceptions and to lampooning by the media.<br>Not simply a book about current problems and future challenges, <i>Failing the Future</i> is rich with practical solutions and workable programs for change. Among her many insights, Kolodny offers a thorough defense of the role of tenure and outlines a new set of procedures to ensure its effective implementation; she proposes a structure for an 'Antifeminist Intellectual Harassment Policy'; and she provides a checklist of family-sensitive policies universities can offer their staff, faculty, and administrators. Kolodny calls on union leaders, campus communities, policymakers, and the general public to work together in unprecedented partnerships. Her goal, as she states in a closing coda, is to initiate a revitalized conversation about public education.<br>This book should be required reading for all those concerned with the future of higher education in this country-from college trustees to graduate students entering the professoriate, from faculty to university administrators, from officers of campus-based unions to education policymakers.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.4109584768 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/06/9780822324706.jpg,Success,111,22.6

Miller produces poignant revelations about what it means to live with a dying parent—as a son or daughter, as well as the difference that gender makes in such a painful situation. In Bequest and Betrayal, she develops an original feminist perspective by counterpointing lyrical introspection about her own grief with critical insights into memoirs by Simone de Beauvoir, Philip Roth, Art Spiegelman, Susan Cheever, Carolyn Steedman, and Annie Ernaux."" —Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, co-authors of The Madwoman in the Attic, No Man's Land, and The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women</p>
<p>""Miller's use of the memoir form offers a new model of serious criticism, and a way of imagining community through ‘bonds of paper’ as well as ‘bonds of blood.’"" —Elaine Showalter, London Review of Books</p>
<p>Melding the details of her own experience with the familial biographies of well-known contemporary writers, Miller recreates a common experience—the loss of a father or a mother—and exposes the often tortuous paths of mourning and attachment that we follow in the wake of loss. In the process, she offers pieces of personal history, revealing the mixed emotions provoked by her mother's sudden death from cancer and her father's painful struggle with Parkinson's disease. Memoirs about the loss of parents show how enmeshed in the family plot we have been and the price of our complicity in its stories. The death of parents forces us to rethink our lives, to reread ourselves. We read for what we need to find. Sometimes, we also find what we didn't know we needed.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.59083886216 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches",20,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/92/9780253213792.jpg,Success,112,22.6

<p>In Women in Science and Engineering: Choices for Success Cecily Cannan Selby and her co-authors identify ways in which women in science can adapt to existing institutional systems, and how these systems can and should improve so that women, and others with diverse backgrounds, will choose to work within them. Ultimately, the seek the benefits to all of a coeducational workforce that is governed, evaluated, and rewarded through coeducational values and attitudes.</p>
<p>The authors describe what progress has been made over the past twenty-five years. They explore questions of workplace rewards to determine what factors keep women in science and engineering. Turning to successes women have had in both the private sector and government, they ask which policies and practices have been proven to work and are worth emulating. And they discuss the role of women in the academic scientific community. In a conclusion, they address questions of what current progress means for the future of women in science and engineering.</p>

<p>Thinking about the body has become highly fashionable, but the renew focus, while certainly welcome, seems to always end at the body's surface. Recent sociological and feminist theory has made important claims about the prowess of cultural inscription on the body, and about the cultural representation of the body, but the body that appears in this new theory seems to be, ironically, disembodied. If this newly theorized body has interioriy, it is one that is explained predominantly through psychoanalysis. The physiological processes inside the body remain a mystery to be explained, if at all, only in the esoteric language of biomedicine.</p>
<p>As a trained biologist, Lynda Birke was frustrated by the gap between feminist cultural analysis and her won scientific background. In this book, she seeks to bridge the this gap by looking ""inside"" the body, using ideas in anatomy and physiology to develop the feminist view that the biological body is socially and culturally constructed. Birke rejects the assumption that the body's functioning is somehow fixed and unchanging, claiming that biological science offers more than just a deterministic narrative of how nature works. <i>Feminism and the Biological Body</i> puts biological science and feminist theory together and suggests that we need a new politics that includes , rather than denies, our bodily flesh.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",28.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/36/9780813528236.jpg,Success,113,22.6

Throughout the previous two decades, pediatricians and women's magazines alike advised mothers of the importance of physicians' guidance for the everyday care of their children, and Spock's book popularized this advice, particularly among white, middle-class women.
<p>When Jacquelyn S. Litt interviewed African-American and Jewish women who raised their children in the 1930s and 1940s, she found that these women responded to experts' advice in ways uniquely shaped by their ethnicity, race, and class. For middle-class African-American and Jewish women, medicalization took place in ethnically/racially segregated networks and functioned as a collectively held strategy for social advance as much as a set of technical practices for raising healthy children. For poor, single African-American mothers, everyday networks offered limited access to medical institutions or mainstream norms. Medical discourse was largely controlled by white women and men, which left these women disempowered in medical institutions and marginal to dominant definitions of acceptable mothering.</p>
<p> Litt's book is enriched with many narratives from the mothers themselves.

Ten years later, having found nothing else at which she can distinguish herself, Lucy tries to save the Eden by capitalizing on a wave of nostalgia for the Borscht Belt and running the hotel as a sort of living museum of Yiddish culture. In the course of the season, Lucy battles her grandmother's attempts to sabotage Lucy's success, her parents' superstitious fears of anything that attracts attention to the Jews, and her brother's contention that what Lucy is doing is more a matter of ego than authentic religious feeling. In the meantime, Lucy comes to realize her love for Mr. Jefferson, the hotel's longtime black handyman, and begins to face the barriers that stand between them. On top of all this, Lucy must contend with a Hasid who buys the chicken farm next door; a cell of ancient Jewish Communists who instigate a strike among Eden's overworked young staff; a gay chef and gay baker who want to prove to the world that kosher cuisine can satisfy the most sophisticated gourmet; and Jimmy Kilcoin - an Irish Catholic Insurance adjustor known as ""the Don Juan of the Catskills"" - who is determined to seduce Lucy before summer's end.",en,New Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/96/9781566397896.jpg,Success,115,22.6

Henrietta",Texas A&M University Press,136,3/1/2000,,Hardcover,"<p>White Painted Woman appears in ancient myths of the Chiricahua Apaches as the virgin mother of the people and the origin of women’s ceremonies. Such Chiricahua myths and traditions have closely prescribed the roles of women in relation to their husbands and children, to relatives and extended families, and to the band or tribe. One of those roles is to safeguard and hand on to the next generation the lore and customs of the people. In this way, Chiricahua women have served as safekeepers of a heritage that is now endangered. For more than a decade, H. Henrietta Stockel has moved with remarkable freedom and intimacy among the Chiricahuas, especially in the women’s friendship circles. With their permission and even blessing, she has observed and recorded aspects of their traditional culture that otherwise might be lost to history.Chiricahua Apache Women and Children, written in a familiar, personal style, focuses on the duties and experiences of historical Chiricahua Apache women and the significant influences they have exerted within the family and the tribe at large.After beginning with a look at creation myths, Stockel turns to family patterns and roles. She describes in detail the puberty ceremony she has repeatedly witnessed, a ceremony little known by those outside the band. Stockel looks also at the alternative lifestyle, also culturally prescribed, of four women warriors. She concludes with Mildred Cleghorn, a contemporary “woman warrior” who was chairperson of the Fort Sill Chiricahua/Warm Springs Apache Tribe in Oklahoma for nearly twenty years and who was also Stockel's close friend and “Apache mother.” Beautifully complemented with thirty-two black-and-white illustrations of women, children, and family life, Chiricahua Apache Women and Children offers a vivid glimpse into traditional Chiricahua Apache women’s lifestyles.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/12/9780890969212.jpg,Success,115,22.6

Coming to power just before the unstable state was about to be absorbed into an autocratic empire, Cleopatra oversaw not only Egypt's progress as an influential regional power but also the fragile peace of its ethnically mixed population.<P> Michel Chauveau looks at many facets of life under this queen and her dynasty, drawing on such sources as firsthand accounts, numismatics, and Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphic inscriptions. His use of such sources helps to free the narrative of dependence on later (and usually hostile) Greek and Roman historians. By taking up such subjects as funeral customs, language and writing, social class structure, religion, and administration, he affords the reader an unprecedented and comprehensive picture of Greek and Egyptian life in both the cities and the countryside.<P> Originally published in French in 1997, Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra fulfills a long-standing need for an accessible introduction to the social, economic, religious, military, and cultural history of Ptolemaic Egypt.<br><p><B>About the Author:</b><BR> Michel Chauveau is a former member of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo, and is currently director of studies at L'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris.

The first consists in establishing alliances between Chicana and Latin American writers/activists like Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga on the one hand and Rigoberta Menchu and Domitilla Barrios de Chungara on her. The second move consists in looking for theories where you can find them, in the non-places of theories such as prefaces, interviews and narratives. By underscoring the non-places of theories, Sonia Sald&iacute;var-Hull indirectly shows the geopolitical distribution of knowledge between the place of theory in white feminism and the theoretical non-places of women of color and of third world women.

As a gifted African-American child growing up in the projects of Brooklyn, McDonald was placed on a path out of poverty not open to many, and yet she struggled to find her way in a world that was alien to her. At Vassar, she felt so alone that she turned to heroin to escape her feelings of isolation. Later she was subjected to a vicious rape that led to a nervous breakdown.

She describes festivals, weddings, childbirth and midwifery, traditional healing methods, battles, and funerals in detail. Her story is followed by the adventures of her oldest son, Pasekur, which end by foreshadowing an early Ainu rebellion against Japanese encroachment.<br> Amply illustrated and prefaced by an extensive introduction to Ainu history, the natural surroundings, and the sources used to construct Harukor and her world, this volume is a unique portrait of Ainu gods and humans, of matters sacred and mundane, and of the distinctive Ainu respect for nature's bounty.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",2.97,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/02/9780520210202.jpg,Success,116,22.6

Some scholars argue that feminist utopian fiction can be used as a template for creating such a future. However, Sally L. Kitch argues that associating feminist thought with utopianism is a mistake. <p> Drawing on the history of utopian thought, as well as on her own research on utopian communities, Kitch defines utopian thinking, explores the pitfalls of pursuing social change based on utopian ideas, and argues for a higher ground &#151;a contrasting approach she calls realism. Replacing utopianism with realism helps to eliminate self-defeating notions in feminist theory, such as false generalization, idealization, and unnecessary dichotomies. Realistic thought, however, allows feminist theory to respond to changing circumstances, acknowledge sameness as well as difference, value the past and the present, and respect ideological give-and-take. <p> An important critique of feminist thought, Kitch concludes with a clear, exciting vision for a feminist future without utopia.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9369646135 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",6,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/73/9780226438573.jpg,Success,116,22.6

The authors interviewed a grandmother, mother, and granddaughter from three Salvadoran families: La Familia Nuñez, members of the upper class; La Familia Rivas, from El Salvador's growing middle class; and La Familia García, from the <i>campo</i>, the Salvadoran peasantry. The voices we hear convey a deep sense of the world of Salvadoran women and how life is lived in that Central American country today.<br>
 Each woman tells her own life story, and interspersed with recollections of childhood, marriage, and childrearing are revealing accounts of El Salvador's turbulent political past and present. Reflected in the stories are the vast changes in educational and occupational opportunities for women and the shifts in male-female relationships. Class differences are still a fundamental part of Salvadoran life, but changes are occurring in this area as well.<br>

0-520-21067-0,America Day by Day,Simone de Beauvoir,University of California Press,408,1/5/1999,,Paperback,"<p>Here is the ultimate American road book, one with a perspective unlike that of any other.<br>
In January 1947 Simone de Beauvoir landed at La Guardia airport and began a four-month journey that took her from one coast of the United States to the other, and back again. Embraced by the Condé Nast set in a swirl of cocktail parties in New York, where she was hailed as the ""prettiest existentialist"" by Janet Flanner in <i>The New Yorker</i>, de Beauvoir traveled west by car, train, and Greyhound, immersing herself in the nation's culture, customs, people, and landscape. The detailed diary she kept of her trip became <i>America Day by Day,</i> published in France in 1948 and offered here in a completely new translation. It is one of the most intimate, warm, and compulsively readable texts from the great writer's pen.<br>
Fascinating passages are devoted to Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and San Antonio. We see de Beauvoir gambling in a Reno casino, smoking her first marijuana cigarette in the Plaza Hotel, donning raingear to view Niagara Falls, lecturing at Vassar College, and learning firsthand about the Chicago underworld of morphine addicts and petty thieves with her lover Nelson Algren as her guide. This fresh, faithful translation superbly captures the essence of Simone de Beauvoir's distinctive voice. It demonstrates once again why she is one of the most profound, original, and influential writers and thinkers of the twentieth century.<br>
<b>On New York:</b>""I walk between the steep cliffs at the bottom of a canyon where no sun penetrates: it's permeated by a salt smell. Human history is not inscribed on these carefully calibrated buildings: They are closer to prehistoric caves than to the houses of Paris or Rome.""<br>

For nearly two years they were forced to take refuge in a crawl space beneath a barn. In this tense and moving memoir, the author tells of her terror and confusion as a child literally buried alive. Her family owed their survival to the reluctant and constantly wavering support of the barn owners, gentiles torn between compassion for Naomi&#8217;s family and fear of a Nazi death sentence if the family was discovered.</p> <h3>KLIATT</h3> <p>Before the age of six, the author lived a middle-class life in the Polish town of Goray, the youngest of five children in a family well-respected by both the community's gentiles and fellow Jews. The earliest years of WW II brought ever escalating degrees of economic, social and physical discomfort, but it wasn't until 1942 that Naomi's family attempted to go into hiding. Naomi begins her family's story here, when she was nine and it was no longer possible to pretend that money could buy relative security at home. Before her family was able to find a Gentile family willing to let them hide in the crawl space under a barn&#151;the cramped quarters in which they were to spend two full years&#151;Naomi's father and oldest sister were captured by the Nazis and another sister was shot as she and Naomi ran from firing soldiers. Amazingly, Naomi's mother was able to save her three remaining children and herself through the duration of the war and its aftermath in Poland. The family emigrated to the U.S. in 1949. Samson tells her story with an immediacy and fluency that earn it a high place in the vast literature of Holocaust experiences. Even as a child she was sensitive to the nuances of interpersonal relations that could save or damn her family's existence. She describes the physical aspects of the hidden life in minute and revelatory detail. Her experiences immediately after the war are also revealing, including as they do a time when she was unable to stand, another period of temporarily assumed orphanage (in order to be fed and housed adequately), and a trip to a concentration camp organized to ingrain upon surviving Jewish children the dire need to tell what happened. An epiloguedescribes the adult Mrs. Samson's changing attitudes about her traumatic experiences, adding yet another layer of insight to a remarkably clear-eyed personal account.

The awkward, insecure child of a world-renowned physician and a beautiful Bostonian ballerina, she has come to attend Queen's Medical School on a tiny Indonesian island. For an exorbitant enrollment fee, Queen's is willing to accept any American child of privilege who has been rejected by all normal medical schools. Not bound by American law, the school specializes in motivating problem students - no matter what the cost to each student. For Jane, given the transgressions of her past, Queen's is her last chance. Surrounded by jungle and sea, Jane is plunged into unrelenting heat and the psychological abuse of the teaching staff. The truest connection she makes on the island is with another student, Keefer. Together they spend their few spare minutes watching as Jonah - a shark that Keefer keeps captive in an ocean pen - slowly circles his cage. As days extend into weeks, Jane feels herself changing, retreating deeper into a body and spirit she no longer recognizes. And as an aura of desperation deepens among her peers, Jane's determination to succeed grows.

Yet they still struggle with the bloody instincts that have tormented humanity since time immemorial. ThreeSys is a triangle of stars with eleven planets each, where people are divided into three classes-Meshed, Jacked, and Jackless-a caste system of technological access. ""Mesh"" has emerged as the universe's single greatest power: a tiny elite of Meshed humans can access unsurpassed knowledge, enter another dimension, and manipulate lesser mortals' reality.
<p>But three of these gifted humans-Eve, Corey, and Annmarie-have harnessed this power for their own evil ends. Traveling throughout ThreeSys, the trio devotes their extraordinary abilities to selling what they claim is an end to all wars and aggression. What they're actually selling is Staze, an opiumlike, instantly addictive drug that wraps the user in dreams and lethargy. Yet some Jacked and Jackless have retaliated against this and other abuses of power, mercilessly hunting down and killing Meshed humans.</p>
<p>Time is running out for the three, even as ebony-hued Eve falls in love with lower caste Naverdi, who's Jacked, a supplier of a key Staze ingredient, and an addict herself. The only answer is on Paradise, the first ThreeSys planet where humans ever set foot. Paradise hadn't survived its first brush with human habitation, and was blasted from its orbit into another solar system millennia ago. Now it's the only place where the Mesh is intact-the old Mesh, the original Mesh, the real one.</p>
<p>The Annunciate-the first person to step off the first ship-still lives in Paradise's mythsand legends.</p>

To her daughter, Emily, this fixation on Pavarotti is a harmless fantasy, the byproduct of loneliness. Meeting Luciano is the story of what happens when Hanako acts on her fantasy and invites opera star Pavarotti to dinner in their Westchester County home.<p>Emily, with no real career plan, has gone back after college to work at her old summer job - waiting tables at the local Japanese steakhouse. Even worse than wearing a fake kimono and obi is that she's living at home with her mother. At first, her mom seems pretty much her old self - still reliving her Japanese childhood; still affecting the airs of a European sophisticate; still brewing espresso, cooking Italian, and singing arias from Rigoletto while she cleans; still idolizing Luciano Pavarotti.</p><p>But when Hanako hires Alex, a handsome Greek, to renovate the kitchen, Emily begins to worry. And when Alex, who seems to be getting very cozy with her mother, spills the secret that the renovation is in preparation for a visit from Pavarotti, Emily is thrown into a wonderfully familiar quandary: how to deal with a parent who might be losing it.</p><p> First-time novelist Anna Esaki-Smith has a wry, understated approach to the themes of assimilation, growing up, striking out on shaky ground, finding yourself - and loving your mother.

<p>This is the dilemma facing Theresa Bedell, a reporter in New York, in Rebecca Gilman's tensely fascinating new play. When Theresa goes on an awkward blind date with a friend of a friend, she sees no reason to continue the relationship—but the man, an attractive fellow named Tony, thinks otherwise. While Theresa is at first annoyed yet flattered by his continuing attention, her attitude gradually changes to one of fear and fury when he starts violently to menace her and those around her.</p>

The stunning discovery that there is a virulent racist on campus forces Sarah, along with other faculty members and students, to explore her feelings about racism, leading to surprising discoveries and painful insights that will rivet and provoke the reader as perhaps no play since David Mamet's Oleanna has done.</p>

Through the course of a day, the youngster, perhaps accidentally, knocks over her juice, drips paint from her picture onto the carpet and slides off her chair at lunchtime, taking the tablecloth with her. Her mother, who didn't like to yell, handles each incident with good-humored restraint: Harriet, my darling child. Harriet, you'll drive me wild. Harriet, sweetheart, what are we to do? But at naptime, Harriet gets on her mother's last nerve when she intentionally rips open a feather pillow: Then Harriet's mother began to yell./ She yelled and yelled and yelled. It's a situation that may well ring true for every family, and Fox (Sleepy Bears), in a rhythm well known to her fans, resolves it with good sense and warmth (mother and daughter apologize to each other, share a giggle and embark on clean-up together). Visually, the book never strikes a false note: Frazee's (The Seven Silly Eaters) handsome domestic vignettes, framed by generous white space, are realistic and reassuring.

Not unlike the false promise of ""having it all"" that women faced in the 1970s, this goal is nearly impossible to achieve. The pain of ""never getting it right"" can be felt across the nation. Others have described the malaise, but until now, no one has described this revolution or pointed to the light at the end of the tunnel. Journalist and feminist Suzanne Braun Levine, a founding editor of Ms. magazine, has interviewed scores of men and learned about the difficulties fathers face in parenting. Since men don't tend to use each other as sounding boards, Levine does it for them. Taking a lesson from the women's movement, she puts her finger on what makes it so hard for men to put family first. Readers will turn to Father Courage to discover what men are experiencing. At home, their parenting learning curve is steep, and moms don't want to give up the role of the General. The workplace is much less family-friendly to men, and the 24/7 life of corporate America takes its toll. Levine shows that fathers and mothers aren't crazy, but stressed, and she offers solutions that range from the commonsense to the revolutionary. This is a brilliant and bracing new look at what is right-and wrong-in American family life.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/22/9780151003822.jpg,Success,124,22.6

Get the lowdown on who's low and how's down, whose long-standing but unspoken conflict with her mother is contributing to her sexual repression, and whose boyfriend named his penis. A hysterical send-up of everyday life and love with lots of heart, <b>Lipshtick</b> is a quick fix, a good schmooze, a heartfelt sob or two.</p>
<p>It will take you on a trip through things universal to all pairs of X chromosomes worth their salt: for coping with social dances in junior high (where the sexes meet like a hormonal high noon) to the joys of plucking out your chin hair like evil weeds; from the natural order of a girl's fantasies (like sweets that don't make you fat, spending that doesn't break the bank, a beautiful nap in the middle of a long day) to why flings with bad boys are the ultimate in dating pleasure (finding the right boy to lust after is a lifelong struggle—eventually you grow to be picky about who rejects you); from getting married (His best quality? He was like family. His worst quality? He was like family.) to the sad state of postnatal breasts. Gwen Macsai cover it all—with a shtick twist. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll thank God you're not her. No situation unaccounted for, no mole left unexamined, Macsai captures a woman's life from her first leg-shave to her last dose of hormone replacement therapy.</p>

Nan Goodman, hurting after a failed marriage and her father's death, goes back to the town of her childhood. As skinny little Nanny, aged five to 12, she either adored or was ashamed of her leftist parents, her writer father who never made enough money for comfort and her devoutly Christian mother who was his inspiration. Wrenching memories of family disasters, and especially the cruel snubs and abject solitude of childhood, are dissipated by love and laughter, and the adult Nan makes peace with her past.

Thus begins Nora Okja Keller's breathtaking first novel, which follows Beccah, a young Korean-American girl growing up in Hawaii, as she uncovers the secret of her mother's past. Completely ignorant of her mother Akiko's history - she was sold into prostitution in the Japanese ""recreation camps"" of World War II for her oldest sister's dowry - Beccah understands that her mother lives in a spirit world she cannot share, and that clearly marks her as ""other."" Narrated in two voices, Beccah's and Akiko's, Keller reveals the story of Akiko's extraordinary dislocation - the slavery of the camps, the death of her first child, her unhappy marriage to an American missionary - which Beccah understands only after her mother's death. In language that is both harsh and lyrical, Keller explores the universally complicated relationship between mother and daughter. She shows us both Akiko's way of survival, sustained by her remarkable strength and her love for her daughter, and Beccah's acceptance of her mother and her own place in a world her mother no longer physically inhabits.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This impressive first novel by a Hawaii-based writer of mixed Korean and American ancestry depicts one of the atrocities of war and its lingering effects on a later generation. An intense study of a mother-daughter relationship, it dwells simultaneously in the world of spirits and the social milieu of the adolescent schoolgirl who later becomes a career woman with lovers. Beccah is a youngish, contemporary Hawaiian whose Korean mother, Akiko, was sold into prostitution as a young woman and sent to a ""recreation camp'' to service the occupying Japanese army. Akiko developed a resilience that allowed her to distance herself from the daily plundering of her body; she also developed an intense communication with the spirit world that helped her survive the horror of her experience-and helped her, too, to catch the attention of a visiting American missionary, who married her and fathered Beccah. After his death, mother and daughter live together in Honolulu, Beccah striving for a normal life, Akiko, often possessed, screaming and wailing, by her ghosts and visions. With the help of a flamboyant, ultra-worldly friend who calls herself Auntie Reno, Akiko becomes a seer and fortune-teller. Akiko's flashbacks to her haunted past and Beccah's account of their lives together are told alternately, and it is one of Keller's several triumphs that she is able to render the two worlds so powerfully and distinctly. Though piercing and moving in its evocation of feminine closeness, however, the narrative becomes somewhat claustrophobic, so that the occasional interventions of the cheerfully vulgar Auntie Reno are hugely welcome. A striking debut by a strongly gifted writer, nonetheless. Author tour.

0-670-88105-8,Motherland: A Daughter's Journey to Reclaim Her Past,"Chapman, Fern Schumer",Viking Adult,208,4/3/2000,,Hardcover,"A poignant mother-daughter journey explores the afterlife of the Holocaust in a story of love, loss, and the persistence of memory<br>
<br>
In 1938, just before they were killed by the Nazis, Freida and Siegmund Westerfeld sent their twelve-year-old daughter Edith to live with relatives in Chicago. Edith escaped the death camps but was left profoundly adrift, cut off from culture, tradition, her entire identity. For decades she shut away her memories, until she realized that the void of her past was consuming her and her family. Then, with her daughter Fern Schumer Chapman--herself a pregnant mother--Edith returned to Germany. <br>
<br>
For Edith the trip was an act of courage, a chance to reconnect with her homeland and reconcile with her past. For Fern it was a miraculous opening, a break in the wall of silence surrounding her mother's past... and her mother. A memoir as lyrical as a novel, <i>Motherland</i> is the narrative of a personal transformation that examines the legacy of war. It is the story of learning to live with the past, of remembering and honoring while looking forward and letting go. In the tradition of Bernhard Schlink's <i>The Reader</i>, <i>Motherland</i> probes a pain that shatters nations, divides generations, and outlives its perpetrators. <br>
<br>
A riveting read, <i>Motherland</i> echoes Ursula Hegi's <i>Stones from the River</i>. It is a loving yet harrowing story of mothers and daughters; of expectations and limitations; of roots, reunion, and ultimately understanding.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/55/9780670881055.jpg,Success,128,22.6

Teen girls, who are socialized to stifle their anger and avoid confrontation, frequently take out their frustration on their mothers as the only safe and available targets. The good news is that with patience and the right guidance, mothers can transform the teenage years into positive ones and enrich the mother- daughter relationship. <i>I'm Not Mad, I Just Hate You!</i> combines the expertise of a clinical psychologist (who has worked with women and adolescent girls for more than twenty years) with that of a senior editor at a leading teen magazine. The book demonstrates how mother-daughter friction during adolescence, managed creatively, empowers girls by teaching them invaluable skills and can even foster intimacy. Discussion of social, emotional, cultural, and psychological issues is interwoven with the voices of mothers and daughters in case studies that are illuminating and reassuring. In the wake of widely popular books exposing the perils adolescent girls face, <i>I'm Not Mad, I Just Hate You!</i> provides mothers with much-needed practical strategies to help their daughters grow into emotionally healthy and capable adults. At the same time, women will encourage loving and lifelong connections with their daughters.</p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Cohen-Sandler, a psychologist, and Silver, an editor of Girl's Life magazine, offer advice to mothers anxious about surviving their daughters' teen years. The authors assume that conflict is a given. Their aim is to provide mothers with strategies for coping with problems and even turning them into something positive. They reason that if girls learn how to handle conflict early on, if they can develop constructive ways of coping with their emotions, they will be that much further ahead in life. The authors offer some interesting examples and suggestions: advising mothers to choose their battles carefully and to calm themselves down before confronting their daughters. They take the usual approach of telling readers what to say and what not to say through a series of short, familiar vignettes. The organization is confusing, however, and leads to some repetition. In their attempt to be sympathetic to teens, the authors at times sound like apologists (""This kind of exasperating self-centeredness, for better or worse, is simply a part of being a teen""), making mothers want to tiptoe timidly around their daughters. The authors shy away from some big issues as well: they tell the story of a mother waiting for the results of a daughter's HIV test but squelch the opportunity to discuss AIDS issues in general. By the time they finish reading, mothers may find themselves yearning for a chapter, if not an entire book, written especially for their daughters on the pressures of motherhood.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",15,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/07/9780140286007.jpg,Success,128,22.6

We know her from the exquisite painted bust in the Berlin Museum, discovered in 1912, which has made her ancient Egypt's most recognizable queen and a symbol of her country's history. Until now, however, she has remained largely unknown and unrecognized for her contributions to Egyptian society. Wife of Akhenaten, the monotheistic pharaoh, adored by her family, blessed by the sun god, and worshiped by her people, Nefertiti suddenly and completely vanished from the record. Was she banished by her husband or raised to rule as his equal? Did she reign, under another name, in her own right? Could she have been the áminence grise behind the young Tutankhamen, her son-in-law?

Its story begins in 1822, when members of the white minority, terrified by the narrowly averted Denmark Vesey slave revolt, hastily organized a private militia. Twenty years later that small home guard was remade into a military college for young white men. Through two world wars the school grew in size and reputation. But The Citadel began to falter in the 1960s. As America wrestled with calls for social change, cadets clung to antique hierarchies born of slavery and war. While careful courtesies were maintained in public, archaic rituals and brutal hazings were carried out behind closed doors.
<p> In 1993, a young woman named Shannon Faulkner acted as the agent of change. When the school rescinded her admission solely because of her gender, she filed a lawsuit. A landmark legal battle ensued, which Faulkner won and which ultimately forced reform on The Citadel. Though Faulkner faced vicious harassment and left after a week, she paved the way for the women who have graduated since. In Glory's Shadow is an engrossing and illuminating look at this pivotal event in military history and the history of women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",26.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/54/9780679446354.jpg,Success,132,22.6

It includes the fundamentals of meditation practice (posture, technique, clothing), descriptions of the basic teachings and major texts, the teacher-student relationship, and what you will find when you visit a zendo, plus a history of Zen from the founding of Buddhism to its major schools in the West. In addition to answering the most frequently asked questions, it offers a listing of American Zen centers and resources, an annotated bibliography, and a glossary.<P>Jean Smith's enormously practical approach ensures that The Beginner's Guide to Zen Buddhism will become the book teachers and students alike will recommend.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Smith, author of several anthologies of Buddhist writings, sets out in her latest work to equip the curious beginner with the basics needed to practice Zen. She successfully anticipates a novice's questions and problems by including sections not only on how to meditate but on what to expect and how to behave when visiting a Zen practice center. This book has the potential to bring Zen to a wider audience; Smith excels at providing simple, clear explanations and packs a parcel of basic information into a small book. However, this work also epitomizes some of the problems attending Zen's recent popularity in America. Smith shies away from calling Zen a religion, sugarcoating the more religious aspects of Zen practice, such as making offerings or paying respect to one's teacher, in an effort to make them palatable to the Zen consumer. She eschews literal translations of Buddhist verses for liberal ones and skims over the differences between Zen and other Buddhist traditions, leaving readers with a Zen whose complexities and contradictions have been neatly rationalized. One hopes that readers will not be disappointed by the actual practice of Zen communities after digesting the idealized portrait presented here. The book's strong point is its popularization of Zen, but here popularization flirts with oversimplification. (Feb.)

0-679-45275-3,The Buddha from Brooklyn,"Sherrill, Martha",Random House,416,4/18/2000,,Hardcover,"In 1985, Catharine Burroughs was a Maryland housewife with two children—and two failed marriages behind her—running a New Age prayer group in her basement. Out of the blue, a monastery in India for which she had raised some money contacted Burroughs and asked her to host His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, one of the highest-ranking lamas of Tibetan Buddhism, on his first visit to America. After meeting Burroughs, and observing her and her followers for a period of five days, he told her that she was a ""great, great bodhisattva,"" and already, unbeknownst to her, practicing Buddhism. Later, in India, he officially recognized this Jewish-Italian woman from Brooklyn as the reincarnation of a sixteenth-century Ti-betan saint, making her the first American woman to be named a tulku, or reborn lama. 
<p><i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i> tells the complex and fascinating story of how Catharine Burroughs, now known as Jetsunma Ahkön Lhamo, embarked on a journey to build the largest Tibetan Buddhist center in America. With boundless enthusiasm but precious little formal training in Buddhist practices and traditions, Jetsunma and her students bought an estate in Poolesville, Maryland, on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., and founded Kunzang Palyul Choling (Fully Awakened Dharma Continent of Absolute Clear Light). Under Jetsunma's tutelage, the group memorized sacred texts and held all-night prayer vigils. They asked venerable Tibetan lamas to visit and give them ""empowerments."" Many took Buddhist vows and became monks and nuns. And as word of this remarkable place spread, others came to see the new lama for themselves and joined her community.</p>
<p>Martha Sherrill, a writer at <i>The Washington Post</i>, heard about Jetsunma in 1993. She visited the center and was charmed by both its charismatic lama, the only Western woman in the male-dominated hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism, and by the monks and nuns (all Americans) living there. They seemed, for the most part, like a remarkably happy group of people whose lives had been transformed by this exotic, imported faith—and by Jetsunma. At the beginning of <i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i>, as the group is breaking ground for a sacred monument called a stupa, Sherrill commences her own journey to discover for herself what makes this unlikely lama—who enjoys clothes shopping and manicures, Motown music and <i>Star Trek</i> reruns—such a magnetic spiritual leader. And as the story unfolds, so do the secrets of this seemingly idyllic sanctuary.</p>
<p>Compassionate and clear-eyed, Sherrill takes her readers on a breathtaking exploration inside the monastery at Poolesville, a place where idealistic but flawed human beings struggle with their devotion every day. She demystifies monastic life and Tibetan Buddhism, and amends the simplified view that most Americans have of this 2,500-year-old faith. Weaving together the stories of the believers into a narrative structure that is as moving and beautiful as the stupa they are building, Sherrill has created a brilliant work of investigative journalism that raises profound, provocative questions about religious faith and its price. <i>The Buddha from Brooklyn</i> is a monument to the miracles and failures that stem from the deepest human longings.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/51/9780679452751.jpg,Success,133,22.6

Here, Ensler's major theme is the lingering effects of violence against women. Two American women--a well-heeled New York psychiatrist and her younger colleague--travel to a refugee camp intending to help Bosnian women ""tell their stories"" after the brutal war in Yugoslavia. Inexperienced in the field, the doctor learns to stop patronizing and start listening, while her more brittle companion retreats into therapeutic jargon. ""When we think of war, we think of it as something that happens to men in fields or jungles,"" says the award-winning playwright in her introduction. ""But after the bombing, after the snipers, that's when the real war begins."" Though deeply political, Ensler's work has no ideological axes to grind, nor does it linger sensationally on rape stories. Spare, self-reflexive and powerful, the play zeroes in on the real postwar conflict: the refugees' contempt for bland, professional talk therapy--and their overwhelming need, at the same time, for help in absorbing the damages. Agent, Charlotte Sheedy. (Feb. 2) Forecast: Though Ensler's new subject matter is darker and less familiar to American women than that of The Vagina Monologues (which sold more than 60,000 copies), Ensler knows her audience and how to attract attention (she appeared on Oprah last fall). Her five-city tour and print campaign targeting college newspapers, in addition to the play's opening in New York in March 2001, will ensure that her devotees take notice.

In most ways, Isabelle and Amy are like any mother and her 16-year-old daughter, a fierce mix of love and loathing exchanged in their every glance. And eating, sleeping, and working side by side in the gossip-ridden mill town of Shirley Falls doesn't help matters. But when Amy is discovered behind the steamed-up windows of a car with her math teacher, the vast and icy distance between mother and daughter becomes unbridgeable.</p>

It also reveals the shifting requirements of a society which depends upon sustaining gender, class, and racial inequality under changing historical conditions.<p>Despite the fact that black and white ""unwed mothers"" in the pre-Roe v. Wade era experienced the same biological events, their lived experiences were very different. <b></b><b><i>Wake Up Little Susie</i></b> surveys the public policies, community attitudes, and private responses to illegitimate pregnancy, maternity, and children that structured these women's experiences. It demonstrates how female sexuality and fertility, and the single mother herself, have been used as proving grounds for theories of race, gender, motherhood, and social stability. Rickie Solinger provides the first published analyses of maternity home programs for unwed mothers from 1945 to 1965, as well as examines how nascent cultural and political constructs such as the ""population bomb"" and the ""sexual revolution"" reinforced racially-specific public policy initiatives. Such initiatives encouraged white women to relinquish their babies, spawning a flourishing adoption market, while they subjected black women to social welfare policies which assumed they would keep their babies and aimed to prevent them from having more.<p>Incorporating the responses of social service and political professionals of this era to the ""crisis"" of out-of-wedlock pregnancy with letters, poems, and statements from the pregnant women themselves, <b></b><b><i>Wake Up Little Susie</i></b> offers readers an arena to explore the intersections of female biology and social constructions of gender, race, and class.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>This book documents the ways in which race shaped the experience of unwed pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s.

<b>-Gore Vidal</b><br>
 ""A marvelous, witty, learned, and sexy book. <i>Bisexuality</i> is destined for landmark status--no one who reads its bold, persuasive argument will ever think the same way about sex.""<br>
<b>-Diane Middlebrook,</b> author of <i>Anne Sexton</i><br>
 ""<i>Bisexuality</i> uncovers a subject long buried deep within the closet of America's cultural unconscious. Garber's capacities as a cultural commentator--delivered here in funny, witty, and sexy prose--are quite dazzling. A tour de force of social criticism, <i>Bisexuality</i> is in itself a cultural event.""<br>
<b>-Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b><br>
 The world is flat. The sun revolves around the earth. Human beings are either heterosexual or homosexual. The first two myths have long been abandoned, but the third has awaited its Columbus or Copernicus. Until now.<br>
 In this witty, learned, and scrupulously researched book, Marjorie Garber examines bisexuality and its many modes through a dazzling variety of critical lenses: cultural, literary, and psychological. <i>Bisexuality</i> is a monumental inquiry into what ""normal"" might mean, and just how difficult it is to make claims about sexuality-someone else's or one's own. Whether you're curious or seriously interested, a lay reader or a student of sexuality or gender, <i>Bisexuality</i> is a book you will have to have. <br>

Patients, their families, environmental activists, physicians, attorneys, and all of those working toward prevention will find this book interesting, informative, and insightful.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Writing for the general reader, Sherman, a practicing internist and the author of Chemical Exposure and Disease, explores the numerous associations between environmental pollution and breast cancer. Her investigation specifically targets hormones (natural and synthetic), radiation (including mammography), and toxic chemicals as prime historical and current cancer-causing agents. Undoubtedly, Sherman's text will prove controversial as the scientific jury is still out on exactly how to prevent cancer and precisely how and when the genetic changes that result in malignancy occur. Rachel Carson introduced the public to the links between pollution and breast cancer in her groundbreaking Silent Spring (1962). Few readers today will be unaware of pollution's public health implications, so this book best serves as a continued clarion call to clean up the environment. Overall, it is well written and provides a riveting account of corporate and institutional (mis)investments in the Cancer Wars.

After two years at the pre-school, five-year-old Jimmy had failed to make any friends, had recently started to act aggressively towards his classmates, and was beginning to react violently to any changes in his routine. Echo was not taken completely by surprise: she had suspected for some time that her son was different from other children. Over the next five years, she and her husband accompanied Jimmy to doctors, medical specialists, learning consultants and psychologists. Finally, at the age of ten, Jimmy was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. This is the book that Echo Fling needed when she first set out to have Jimmy diagnosed, and it will enable parents and teachers to understand and help other children with Asperger Syndrome.

Decades later, she realized that in her efforts to achieve normality she had not spoken to her children or her grandchildren of her terrifying odyssey. Her memoir of the period between 1939 and 1945, was written for her children so that they would <i>Inherit the Truth</i>.</p><p>This is the story of the destruction of a talented Jewish family, and of the survival against all the odds of two young sisters. Anita and her elder sister Renate defied death at the hands of the Gestapo and the SS over a period of two and a half years, being first imprisoned as criminals and then being transferred, separately to Auschwitz, and finally to Belsen. They were saved by their exceptional courage, determination and ingenuity, and by several improbable strokes of good luck -- the greatest of which was the fact that Anita played the cello.</p><p>Lasker-Wallfisch draws from her own startlingly vivid memories of her experience, and also incorporates the letters her family wrote to one another during this period as well as other primary documents.

<p>She couldn't sleep. She couldn't stop trembling with anxiety. And she worried that she would throw her precious baby boy down the stairs if she continued to lose her mind. That is how Postpartum Depression tore apart Susan Kushner Resnick's world. And she had no idea that thousands of other new mothers were experiencing the same agony.</p>
<p>While she struggled to take care of her two children, Resnick searched for a book by a survivor of Postpartum Depression, something that would show her in black and white that she could survive the worst period in her life. But no such book existed. So, when she finally conquered her demons, she wrote one.</p>
<p>Sleepless Days is a brilliantly written, haunting memoir of her encounter with Postpartum Depression. It is a story for the other 400,000 women who are afflicted with PPD each year and are desperate for reassurances that others have felt their despair and recovered. It is a compelling narrative for anyone who has ever watched helplessly as a vulnerable woman fought against the weight of this mysterious disease.</p>
<p>Resnick's symptoms begin with the onslaught of insomnia, anxiety attacks, and a general apathy toward her newborn son. She loses weight and gains moodswings. She suffers from an ongoing tension that no glass of wine can cut through. She listlessly stumbles through each day like a zombie. And because an entire summer feels like one long night, she comes to think of her existence as a series of sleepless days with the same fogginess and hypersensitivity, the same sense of disorientation and loneliness one feels when gazing out a window at streetlights and moonshine in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Feelings of isolation sear through every page of Sleepless Days. Resnick recounts the hours spent watching the television screen-wishing the people from the TV could smash through the screen and come sit with her. And she compares her battle with insomnia to a menacing soldier standing guard over her, threatening her with images of what could happen to her child if she dares to allow herself a peaceful night's rest. Her journey finally takes us into her world of therapy, which leads to her heartbreaking decision to forgo breastfeeding in order to begin taking antidepressants.</p>
<p>Through Resnick's devastating account shines a ray of hope. She develops an extraordinary friendship with a Holocaust survivor. She learns to lean on friends. And she accepts the lack of control that defines her life. Her own rebirth is juxtaposed with the arrival of Autumn. She poignantly writes, The trees on this street are starting to look as if a child dipped her fingers into red and yellow fingerpaints and smeared them over the green parts. They are dying a beautiful death. And she is coming back to life.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.68 Inches, Length: 5.58 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 0.885 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/63/9780312253363.jpg,Success,137,22.6
0-684-83808-7,Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America,"Powers, Ann",Simon & Schuster,288,2/23/2000,,Hardcover,"<p>There is a feeling of nostalgia that surrounds the idea of bohemia, that place where art and ideas and alternative thinking become the focal point of life. To most, bohemia is gone—erased by the lifestyle of the 1990s and the too many, too fast influences of modern living.</p>
<p>Ann Powers, an acclaimed pop critic for <i>The New York Times</i> and one of today's most notable authorities on alternative culture, claims in this powerful and personal chronicle that bohemia is alive and well in America—nurturing new lifestyles and defining our tastes in art, politics, sexual mores, and all matters cultural. <i>Weird Like Us</i> sets the record straight on alternative America—a new bohemia whose dynamic citizens are re-creating traditional modes of building families, falling in love, having sex, and making careers, reinventing our shared values from the ground up.</p>
<p>So how different are these bohemians? Through stories from her own life and those of her fellow alternative Americans—artists, writers, entrepreneurs, feminists, cyberoutlaws, punk rockers, politicos, and queers—Powers traces the evolution of this world and where it has gone. The observations and attitudes that fill these pages will touch many who long for this lifestyle, and will shock others. No longer confined to coffee shops in North Beach or Greenwich Village, bohemia is thriving from coast to coast.</p>
<p>In this wonderfully written memoir, Ann Powers writes of an alternatie culture that has never before been fully presented—one that takes into account the real politics, real feelings, and genuine creativity of those who transofrmed the dying counterculture of the sixties into a mode of artistic and spiritual survival in the nineties. In doing so, she has written a vibrant, engrossing take on a culture and its people.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/83/9780684838083.jpg,Success,137,22.6

So begins <i>South Mountain Road,</i> Hesper Anderson's elegant, wrenching memoir of death and deception, family secrets and memories, and of a young girl's trauma of self-discovery.</p>
<p>When Hesper Anderson, the daughter of famed Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Maxwell Anderson <i>(What Price Glory?, Winterset, Key Largo, The Bad Seed),</i> got the phone call informing her that her mother, the beautiful, enigmatic Mab, had committed suicide, she knew that her world would be forever changed. A woman of baffling remoteness and alienating beauty, Mab Anderson had been the dominant figure in her daughter's life. What Hesper did not realize, however, was that beyond the inevitable devastation of loss lay a whole chain of discoveries that would link her irrevocably both to her mother's past and to secrets that would turn her world upside down.</p>
<p>Hesper was a shy young girl, insecure and — to her mind — inadequate. As a result, she spent much of her childhood adrift, rendered all but invisible by the alienating shadow of her mother, surrounded (but not impressed) by the brilliance and celebrity of her parents' friends and neighbors — people such as the composer Alan Jay Lerner, cartoonists Bill Mauldin and Milton Caniff, playwright/composer Kurt Weill and Weill's wife, actress Lotte Lenya (who was also Mab's best friend) — all of whom lived on or near South Mountain Road, in a rural community outside New York City.</p>
<p>It was to be expected, then, that when a handsome young author, himself an outsider, brought into the charmed world of South Mountain Road by Maxwell Anderson, showed Hesper special attention, she developed a schoolgirl crush on him. It was an attachment that endured for years and continued to haunt the impressionable young girl to the brink of womanhood and beyond, leading, perhaps inevitably, to an emotional crisis almost as devastating as her mother's death.</p>
<p>Hesper was away from South Mountain Road, off at college, when she got the call that her mother was dead. When that call came, Hesper began what was in effect a journey of discovery — an immersion in the past that revealed unexpected facts about herself, about the world she had grown up in, and most especially about the two people who were her parents. What she discovered in the end was a series of shocking secrets, some terrible truths, and her own broken heart.</p>
<p> <i>South Mountain Road</i> is a startlingly personal and beautifully conceived and written story of a young girl's coming of age through the suicide of her mother.
