New Words has created an advisory group that

people with analyses about the state of the economy,
technology, and the future. The group has been both
insightful and helpful.
Modern Times (which works valiantly to fill the
void left by the closing of San Francisco’s feminist book-
store a few years ago) is running an “Indie Press of the
Month” series. The series honors the contributions of
small and independent presses to the health of our liter-
ary culture. “Modern Times believes,” the statement
reads, “that in an era of chain bookstores and massive
publishing conglomerates, independent booksellers
and presses form a natural — and indispensable — cre-
ative partnership.” The series features a different
independent press each month and offers a 25 percent
discount on all of the press’ books for a month (most
presses are more than glad to offer a deeper discount in
exchange for the promo that compensates for the dis-
count) and special events featuring the press and its
authors, backlist, and/or new titles. It’s one more way
to (tactfully and positively) drive that important
message home to both customers and the media, and
it’s a great hook for getting a bit of extra media attention.

New This Spring From ABRAMS
This richly illustrated biography traces the
lives of illustrators Jessie Wilcox Smith and
Elizabeth Shippen Green, and muralist Violet
Oakley, who made a pact to live together
forever—until one of them created havoc by
leaving the fold to marry. Revealing a
household of intimate friendship, mutual
inspiration, shared ideas, and love, The Red
Rose Girls is an unforgettable story of three
extraordinary women who captivated
early 20th century society with their brilliant
careers and uncommon lifestyle.

two years ago. Holland is another woman activist
who has led an incredible life. She was raped at eleven
and immediately became a rebel, getting expelled
from high school, turning to prostitution, and serving
jail time for shoplifting and assault. She says, “I’ve
been a whore, I've been a thief, and I've been a street
fighter. This book is for anyone who wants a better
life.” During the civil rights movement, Holland
found her calling as an activist and leader. She was
imprisoned over and over again for the civil rights
cause, and white bigots cruelly attacked her family.
Having persevered so much in her life, Holland has
triumphed as wel], receiving her doctorate from the
University of Minnesota. This book tells of the com-
