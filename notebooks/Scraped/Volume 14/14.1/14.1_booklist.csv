But Ronnie, with her special expertise in burglar alarm systems — getting past them, that is — and her best friend, Blackie Coogan, shamus emeritus of San Francisico, operate on the legit side of the law.
<p>Running is supposed to be the path to health, but for Ronnie it's suddenly a direct route to danger. At six A.M. on the edge of the bay, she's the jogger who stumbles onto the scene of a crime.

Now she's running for her life from the barrios to San Francisco's ritziest neighborhoods . . . and her destination is that dark place called Justice and Revenge.</p>",en,1,"Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",5.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/36/9780440209836.jpg,Success,58.0,14.1

Feminist approaches have pushed forward both the theory of literary criticism and the understanding of individual works of literature. K. K. Ruthven's lucid introduction to the subject offers a broad survey, looking at the impact of Marxism, structuralism, and post-structuralism on feminist critical practice; the argument that literary language has been shaped by masculine bias; and feminist claims for distinctive styles and traditions of women's writing. As a lively contribution written by a man to a highly controversial topic dominated by women, K. K.

In the area of public housing, design has built-in assumptions about how domestic work is done. The result is public housing that is not convenient or helpful to women and children.<br>
<br>
Looking at this problem from a historical perspective, Living in a Man-Made World examines the relationship of gender to housing design. Design is viewed in broad terms, as part of the social process of society, rather than as a separate sphere in which the architect has sole responsibility for decision making. Roberts argues that many of the ills of contemporary society can be traced to the barriers that have formed between the concerns of social policy, planning and architecture. By studying how gender assumptions have operated in the design of housing, Living in a Man-Made World points the way to how improvements may be achieved.",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",37.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/77/9780415032377.jpg,Success,80.0,14.1

This is not to say that a utopian workplace is portrayed herein. Exploitation has not been eradicated; equal pay is still the goal, not the reality. Work can often be boring and unfulfilling.<p>But women here are not victims. These are strong women -- survivors. They set boundaries, take risks, demand respect, and maintain their self-esteem, with or without the help of management, coworkers, family or friends. And they do it with a sense of humor! In traditional and nontraditional jobs, at home and in the workplace, these women are using their power to take charge of their own lives, challenging each of us to do the same.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This collection, conceived to broadly address the subject of women's work, focuses mainly on women in dead-end jobs struggling to make ends meet, with little hope of finding fulfilling employment opportunities. In Candida Lawrence's witty tale, ``Spotter,'' for example, Alice labors as a cashier at an amusement park, demeaned by her overzealous boss and the ridiculous uniform she must wear. Nevertheless, several of the stories here are noteworthy for their uncompromising portrayals of women fighting to gain respect and financial security in various work milieus, particularly Karen Loeb's ``Machines,'' Barbara Unger's ``Search Committee'' and Virginia Rudasill Mortenson's ``Hideaway Inn.'' Overall, the poetry tends to be amateurish and cliched. Kate Braid's ``These Hips'' is spoken by a female contractor whose ``strong hips are built for the birth of buildings,'' and Leslea Newman's ``Ode to Secretaries of America'' urges women to ``get up off their chairs and take a walk in the sun.'' The photographs are unexciting representations of women going about their everyday work routines. Martz is editor of Papier-Mache Press.

<p>In the early 1950s, when tattoos were the indelible mark of a lowlife, an erudite professor of English—a friend of Gertrude Stein, Thomas Mann, Andre Gide, and Thornton Wilder—abandoned his job to become a tattoo artist (and incidentally a researcher for Alfred Kinsey). Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos tells the story of his years working in a squalid arcade on Chicago’s tough State Street. During that time he left his mark on a hundred thousand people, from youthful sailors who flaunted their tattoos as a rite of manhood to executives who had to hide their passion for well-ornamented flesh.</p>
<p>Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos is anything but politically correct. The gritty, film-noir details of Skid Row life are rendered with unflinching honesty and furtive tenderness. His lascivious relish for the young sailors swaggering or staggering in for a new tattoo does not blind him to the sordidness of the world they inhabited. From studly nineteen-year-olds who traded blow jobs for tattoos to hard-bitten dykes who scared the sailors out of the shop, the clientele was seedy at best: sailors, con men, drunks, hustlers, and Hells Angels.</p>
<p>These days, when tattoo art is sported by millionaires and the middle class as well as by gang members and punk rockers, the sheer squalor of Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos is a revelation. However much tattoo culture has changed, the advice and information is still sound:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to select a good tattoo artist</li>
<li>what to expect during a tattooing session</li>
<li>how to ensure the artist uses sterile needles and other safety precautions</li>
<li>how to care for a new tattoo</li>
<li>why people get tattoos—25 sexual motivations for body art
<p>More than a history of the art or a roster of famous—and infamous—tattoo customers and artists, Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos is a raunchy, provocative look at a forgotten subculture.</p>

She Ran A Newspaper Ad Inviting Indigents Dying Of Cancer To Come Live With Her To Be Cared For Until Their Death. The Journey That Led This Daughter Of One Of America's Most Prominent Literary Figures To That Lower East Side Tenement Is The Subject Of This Fascinating And Far-reaching Biography By Patricia Dunlavy Valenti. Rose Was Born In 1851, The Youngest Child Of Nathaniel And Sophia Hawthorne. As An Adult, She Reflected Upon A Childhood That Made Me Seem To Myself A Stranger Who Had Come Too Late. Indeed, Throughout Much Of Her Life, Rose Found Her Own Sense Of Identity Subsumed By The Demands And Needs Of Those Closest To Her.^ She Was Overshadowed Not Only By Her Famous Father But Also By Her Brother, Julian, Who Achieved A Modest Degree Of Literary Fame In His Own Right, And By Her Sister, Una, Whose Fragile Health Was A Constant Source Of Concern To Her Family. In 1871, Rose Married George Parsons Lathrop, Who Would Become A Writer And An Editor Of Her Father's Works. Rose Herself Had Begun To Write Fiction And Poetry At An Early Age, And After The Death Of Their Only Child In 1881, She Saw The Publication Of Much Of Her Work. Valenti Reads These Stories And Poems With A Biographer's Eye And Finds Them Filled With Clues Pointing To The Remarkable Transformation That Would Allow Their Author To Transcend Victorian Constraints And Claim The Kind Of Life That Would Realize Her Singular Gifts. Particularly Illuminating Are The Works Rose Completed During The Years In Which She Was Making A Break From Her Husband, Whom She Left In 1896.^ After Her Final Separation From Her Husband, Rose, Who Had Converted To Roman Catholicism In 1891, Devoted The Remainder Of Her Life To The Work Carried On To This Day By The Order Of Nuns She Founded, The Servants Of Relief For Incurable Cancer. The Account Of Her Ministry, Begun When Cancer Was Thought Contagious, Should Establish Rose Hawthorne Lathrop As A Visionary In Her Belief That Everyone Has A Right To Die With Dignity And As A Pioneer In Her Advocacy Of Compassionate Methods Of Caring For Those Near Death. Valenti's Well-written And Thoroughly Researched Biography Will Interest A Wide Audience, From Those Who Would Enjoy A Lively Glimpse Of The Hawthorne Household To Those Concerned With The Documenting Of Women's Contributions To Society. -- Publisher's Description Rosebud -- Pessima -- Rösl -- Mrs. George Parsons Lathrop -- Rose Hawthorne Lathrop -- Rose Hildegarde -- Sister Mary Alphonsa -- Mother Mary Alphonsa.
