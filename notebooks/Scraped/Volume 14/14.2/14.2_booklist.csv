Whose Knowledge?: Thinking from Women's Lives,"Harding, Sandra",Cornell University Press,336.0,1991-05-09,"Women In Science, Feminist Theory, Knowledge, Theory Of, Science, Social Aspects",Paperback,"<p>With a book that is guaranteed to upset familiar assumptions about or ways of knowing, Sandra Harding again steps into the center of a thorn debate--a debate about the nature of the scientific enterprise and of human knowledge itself. Vigorously and persuasively, she develops further the themes first addressed in The Science Question in Feminism. It that widely influential book, she asked what it is that is distinctive about feminist research. Here she conducts a compelling analysis of feminist theories on the philosophical problem of how we know what we know.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In a dozen intriguing, thought-provoking essays viewing science and its practice from a feminist perspective, Harding takes up some of themes from her earlier work The Science Question in Feminism. ``Why `Physics' Is a Bad Model for Physics'' argues that the image of ``pure'' science as value-free and distinct from applied science and technology is an illusion and, further, that science with no socially useful application could ``reasonably be seen as a make-work welfare program for the middle classes.'' ``What Is Feminist Epistemology'' explores feminist empiricism, which asserts that the problem with scientific inquiry lies not in its standards but in the fact that it fails to meet its own standards; Harding also examines the more radical feminist standpoint theories, which claim that what a culture calls ``knowledge'' is itself socially situated, that knowledge looks different from the standpoint of women's lives. ``Reinventing Ourselves as Other,'' while regarding women as science's post-modern ``other,'' approaches ``the Monster Problem: what does and should it mean to be a male feminist?''

The authoritative contributors to the book not only analyze these problems in general terms but also suggest practical strategies for making online research more effective and productive.
<p>The sixteen chapters in this much-needed book are organized into three broad categories covering disciplines, such as humanities and social sciences; format of the material covered, such as non-bibliographic and cited reference databases; and specific topics, such as lesbian studies and women of color.</p>
<p>Chapter authors employ a variety of useful methods to analyze issues of coverage and content. They compare the results of controlled vocabulary and free-text or full-text searching and make use of search examples, cited reference and multi-file searching, and bibliometric techniques, including analysis of recall, precision, overlap, relevancy, uniqueness, and trends in file growth. The Database Matrix provides an alphabetical listing of files discussed in the book and serves as a directory for online research in women's studies.</p>
<p>Women Online will be useful to librarians, scholars, and students who search databases, as well as to producers who design and market them.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",57.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/32/9781560240532.jpg,Success,73.0,14.2

0-385-26762-2,Banished Knowledge: Facing Childhood Injuries,"Miller, Alice",Anchor,212.0,1991-09-01,,Paperback,"<p><P>In direct opposition to the Freudian drive&#160;&#160;theory, the author of the best-selling <i>The Drama&#160;&#160;Of The Gifted Child </i>believes that&#160;&#160;children, at birth, are inherently good, and she&#160;&#160;traces all forms of criminal deeds to past&#160;&#160;mistreatments.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>In her strongest book yet advocating children's rights, Miller ( The Drama of the Gifted Child, The Untouched Key ) charges that psychoanalysis, a field in which she has worked for more than 20 years, perpetuates child abuse because its practitioners consistently deny the wrongs parents commit against their children. Her message is that both psychoanalysts and parents often fail to see abuse for what it is because they fail to comprehend their own childhood traumas. To illustrate her point, Miller draws from stories of child beatings, sexual abuse, and incest, frequently rationalized as forms of discipline and ``necessary'' sexual initiation. She also analyzes literary works (O'Neill, Kafka, Arthur Miller) that ultimately play down child abuse in the interest of family solidarity. To break destructive patterns, Miller outlines a new method of treatment, which, she says, improved her own life dramatically. Unfortunately, Miller devotes too little discussion to this method in favor of material she has covered in earlier works. Nonetheless, the reader is left with much to consider.-- Michelle Lodge, New York</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.43651527876 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches",11.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/25/9780385267625.jpg,Success,86.0,14.2

0-916583-83-X,Stranded,"Tusquets, Esther",Dalkey Archive Press,230.0,1991-09-01,Fiction,Hardcover,"<p>Spanish feminist writer Esther Tusquets has won a discriminating following in this country with two earlier novels published in translation, Love Is a Solitary Game and The Same Sea as Every Summer. Stranded is a novel about love and betrayal among friends and lovers, husbands and wives. For years, Elia and her husband Jorge have spent their summers with their friends Eva and Pablo at a resort town on the Costa Brava. This summer, Elia arrives alone&#151;silent, desolate, and wishing to become as inert as a stone. Jorge has left her and her world has collapsed.<BR>Her friends can do little to help. Eva, a liberal lawyer, is devastated when she learns that her husband Pablo has begun an affair with a girl half his age in a desperate attempt to recapture his youth and creativity. Eva is further hampered by the presence of Clara, a moody teenager with a history of molestation who has fallen in love with Eva. Each of these characters is desperately dependent upon another for a sense of self-worth, and only Elia emerges at the end with a liberating feeling of independence&#151;though even this may be illusory.<BR> Using a stream-of-conscious technique reminiscent of Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf, Tusquets explores the idea that the loss of love is always hard bitter sad that its end is always painful for everyone and surely much more so for women.<BR> <p> Tusquets delves into the theme of midlife dissatisfaction and its devastating impact upon women. . . . Recommended. (Library Journal 8-91)<BR> <p> The language, the beautiful images . . . linger in the mind. (Booklist 10-1-91)<BR> <p> Compulsive reading. . . . Without diminishing the suffering of the characters it portrays, Stranded is an amusing and positive novel. Tusquets has a talent for selecting the detail that typifies a character. (Times Literary Supplement 11-8-91)<BR> <p> Moving between the perspectives of each character, this novel gives a sense of claustrophobia, despair, and obsession. But it also breathes with hope. Minute and profound shifts are possible. Tusquets creates something akin to the lyrical recollections we have of our own lives, an accumulation of experience. (Aurelie Jane Sheehan, Belles Lettres Summer 93)<BR> <p> The clash between lyrical and critical language, between the anguish and the anger of the narrative voice, expertly captured in Susan E. Clark's translation, draws the reader into the text. Esther Tusquets has managed to write a novel for our time. (American Book Review Aug-Sept 92)<BR></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Tusquets, a well-known Spanish feminist writer, has an elegant style, but this third novel of a trilogy (Love Is a Solitary Game; The Same Sea as Ev ery Summer) lacks cohesiveness.

Couture argues that a logic of interdependence, informed by a feminist reappropriation of the classical theological tradition of Luther and Wesley, offers a basis for a more responsive, and responsible, family policy of ""universalized care."" Blessed Are the Poor? argues that the language of a long-standing American tradition--self sufficiency--has informed American family policy and has in turn contributed to the growth of women's poverty.

                        <p>The decade of the '80s saw a growing rift between the rich and the poor in the United States. Poverty increased among women with children--the so-called ""female-headed family""--more rapidly than among any other population group. Couture's work argues that the tradition of self-sufficiency has contributed to the growth of women's poverty, and instead supports a policy of interdependence.

In this study Inez Hedges looks closely at films that challenge accepted norms in both form and content. The films discussed here, including Zazie, La Nuit de Varennes, and Interiors, break out of conventional frames, upsetting our expectations about how films should look (the film frame) as well as how experience is usually organized by cinematic works of art (the psychological or cognitive frame). Hedges focuses on two primary areas&#58; the way that the structure of film texts guides the interpretations of the spectator (hermeneutics) and the way that films reflect social models (representation).<P>Breaking the Frame will be of interest not only to scholars and students of film and literature but also to today's ""filmliterate"" public who enjoy exploring the theoretical and philosophical implications of cinematic works.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.61949895622 Pounds, Width: 0.41 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/13/9780253206213.jpg,Success,53.0,14.2

Do women's voices yield a distinct approach to the study of ethics?
<p>Although they're far from uniform, women's voices, shaped by legacies of sexual politics, differ enough from men's to warrant a separate hearing. In <i>Feminist Ethics</i> feminist philosopher Claudia Card provides the forum. She brings together fifteen new essays on the nature, current state, and implications of feminist ethics, including many by some of the best and best known feminist philosophers in the U.S.</p>
<p>The connecting threads?</p>
<p>""Feminist ethics is born of women's refusals to endure with grace the arrogance, indifference, hostility, and damage of oppressively sexist environments,"" Card writes. Thus, woven throughout feminist writings on ethics run experiences of oppression. From a variety of perspectives the writers of these essays address a fundamental question: If oppressive contexts shape the moral development of the oppressed, what does it mean for the oppressed to resist, to make morally responsible choices, to become moral agents, to develop character?</p>
<p>This volume presents no single answer. Instead, the essays collected here reflect the pluralism and ""feistiness"" of modern feminism. Subjects range from the history of feminist ethics to the logic of pluralist feminism, presenting feminist perspectives on such unexpected topics as terrorism, bitterness, women trusting other women, and survival and ethics.</p>
<p>Author Biography: Claudia Card, professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, is the author of <i>Lesbian Choices</i> and <i>The Unnatural Lottery: Character and Moral Luck</i> and the editor of <i>On Feminist Ethics and Politics</i>.<br>
