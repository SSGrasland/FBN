TAMARIND & MANGO WOMAN
by OPAL PALMER ADISA
Adisa's exploration of her womanhood, relationships, politics and
Caribbean roots combine for a riveting collection of poetry, unique in
that even specific events and places become recognizable to the
reader, Tamarind and Mango Woman is divided into two sections. The
first Tamarind in which the poetry reflects the bittersweetness of the
fruit itself, pulls the reader along a “cultural tour” into the Caribbean.
The second, Mango Woman, speaks of woman strength, finding it
and holding onto it. Reading this collection is a must!

dark diaspora...in DUB
by Ahdri Zhina Mandiela
dark diaspora...in DUB, a stage script, explores the present day psyche
of the dark diaspora which revels in the surety that it is “Afrikan by
instinct” and heir to a specific legacy of joy, pain, hopes and a
continual driving force. The lone character in “dark diaspora” speaks
from her immediately familiar heritage, the Caribbean. In poems she
struggles to uncrate her vision of home. From the deep gashes of the
“dark diaspora” rhythms pound, evoking rain for new roots.

If the name Women in Translation sounds famil-
iar — it should! For six years, from 1984, with the
publication of An Everyday Story: Norwegian Women’s
Fiction, to 1990, with Words of Farewell: Stories by Korean
Women Writers, Women in Translation was an imprint
of Seal Press. Its purpose was to make available in
English translation literature from women around the
world.
Publishing translations had its thrills, including
meeting authors like the wittily rambunctious Gerd
Brantenberg and the inspiring Nawal el-Saadawi. It
also had its drawbacks. My worst memory is of spend-

“The Wall is a challenging, disturbing, thought-provoking, beautiful book
about the essentials in life. A really good book for a discussion group.”

“I think The Wall will sell...& could turn into a steady ‘cult classic’ in the 60’s
tradition.” — Susan, Regulator Bookshop, Durham NC.
The Wallis at once a simple and moving tale — of potatoes and beans, of hoping

New Titles From The Crossing Press
Coming Into Our Fullness
On Women Turning Forty
By Cathleen Rountree
Foreword by Riane Eisler
oming Into Our Fullness is a collection
of full-page photographs and interviews
with 18 dynamic women between the
ages of 40 and 50, who have in common
passionate concerns and visions for a new world.
They are creating their own initiations into middle
life and, in the process, changing the mid-life
crisis to a promising mid-life discovery.
Such celebrated women as Judy Chicago (artist),
Maxine Hong Kingston (writer), Barbara Boxer
(politician), Linda Leonard (Jungian analyst and
writer), and Cokie Roberts (journalist and politi-
cal analyst) reveal that the second half of a
woman’s life is a profound opportunity for trans-
formation.
