This selection of eleven storiessome more than 3,000 years old focuses on the women of ancient British mythology, from the formidable women warriors who trained heros to fight and kill to the beautiful companions who led them to higher realms of feminine intuition and spiritual wisdom.

These powerful stories transmit a recognition of the mystery of being and an understanding of the powerful magic of inner transformation.<p>Moyra Caldecott, author of more than 16 books and novels set in prehistoric times, including <em>Guardians of the Tall Stones</em> and <em>Crystal Legends</em>, has devoted the major portion of her life to collecting and examining myths and legends across the world.<em>Women in Celtic Myth</em> shows how these tales form a code of universal symbolic importance in expressing the eternal journey of the human spirit. With degrees in both English literature and philosophy, Caldecott lectures on the subject of Celtic myths at sacred sites throughout England.</p>",en,Original ed.,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/75/9780892813575.jpg,Success,78.0,15.2

In Just Five Years Palestinian Women Have Not Only Overcome Centuries Of Isolation, Dependence, And Repressive Gender Roles, But They Have Emerged--and Will Remain--a Key Force Behind The Popular Struggle Known As The Intifada And A Significant Threat To Israeli Control Over The Occupied Territories. Before The Onset Of The Intifada In 1987, Most Palestinian Women Rarely Left Their Homes, And Could Do So Only If Escorted By A Female Relative. They Could Not Divorce Their Husbands, And If A Palestinian Woman Was Sexually Harassed Or Abused, She Was Ostracized From The Community And Could Even Be Killed.^ Three Months After The Intifada Began, With No Recourse To Law Or Redress In The Face Of The Arrests, The Beatings, The Torture, And The Shootings By The Israeli Military, Palestinian Women Took To The Streets, Holding More Than One Hundred Marches A Week. Led By The Women's Committees That Were Formed In The Late 1970s, They Have Since Gone On To Create An Entire Social And Economic Infrastructure To End Palestinian Reliance On Israel. In Their March Toward Equality, They Are Enforcing Strike Days And Boycotts Of Israeli Products, Providing Underground Health Care, Building Agricultural Cooperatives And Small-scale Industries, Opening Alternative Schools, And Smuggling Food To Communities Under Curfew. The Extent To Which The Massive Transformation In The Lives Of Palestinian Women Will Endure Once Independence Is Achieved Remains A Question.^ As Long As The Occupation Lasts, Strum Asserts, Meaningful Reform--whether In Gender Equality, Politics, Or Economics--will Fail To Reach Fruition In Both The Occupied Territories And Israel. Nevertheless, As She Concludes In One Of The Most Gripping Accounts Of The Israeli-palestinian Conflict Written To Date, Palestinian Women Will Never Return To Their Traditional Status, And They Hold Out The Promise Of Profound Change In The Middle East. 1.

So The Public Discussion Of Film Assumes, And So Film Theory Claims. According To That View, The Power Of Films Like Halloween And Texas Chain Saw Massacre Lies In Their Ability To Yoke Us In The Killer's Perspective And To Make Us Party To His Atrocities. In This Book Carol Clover Argues That Sadism Is Actually The Lesser Part Of The Horror Experience And That The Movies Work Mainly To Engage The Viewer In The Plight Of The Victim-hero - The Figure Who Suffers Pain And Fright But Eventually Rises To Vanquish The Forces Of Oppression. A Paradox Is That, Since The Late 1970s, The Victim-hero Is Usually Female And The Audience Predominantly Male. It Is The Fraught Relation Between The Tough Girl Of Horror And Her Male Fan That Clover Explores. Horror Movies, She Concludes, Use Female Bodies Not Only For The Male Spectator To Feel At, But For Him To Feel Through. The Author Concentrates On Three Genres In Which Women And Gender Issues Loom Especially Large: Slasher Films, Satanic Possession Films, And Rape-revenge Films, Especially Those In Which The Victim Is From The City And The Rapists From The Country. Her Investigation Covers Over Two Hundred Films, Ranging From Admired Mainstream Examples, Such As The Accused, To Such Exploitation Products As The Widely Banned I Spit On Your Grave. Clover Emphasizes The Importance Of The Low Tradition In Filmmaking, Arguing That It Has Provided Some Of The Most Significant Artistic And Political Innovations Of The Past Two Decades. Female-hero Films Like Silence Of The Lambs And Thelma And Louise May Be Breakthroughs From The Point Of View Of Mainstream Hollywood Cinema, But Their Themes Have A Long Ancestry In Lowlife Horror.

0-918393-91-4,Sexuality and Eroticism Among Males in Moslem Societies (Haworth Gay&Lesbian Studies),,Routledge,218.0,1992-03-06,,Paperback,"<p>Here is the first major work published about sexuality and eroticism between males in Islamic society. Through narratives, analytic essays, descriptions, and academic treatises, Sexuality and Eroticism Among Males in Moslem Societies provides a revealing and most fascinating look into what is--for most Westerners--still a very hidden, very foreign culture. <p>Until now there has existed a lack of solid information about sexuality in Islamic society, but this volume portrays very clearly the relationship between same-sex eroticism and the ideal of the man as penetrator. As a result, Sexuality and Eroticism Among Males in Moslem Societies illuminates not only homosexuality but the whole sexual culture and role of gender in the Muslim world. The chapters focus on homosexuality among men in Morocco, Syria, Iran, Turkey, and Israel. Despite its occurrence in this region of the world, sex between males is not considered to be &#8220;homosexuality&#8221; by most men--a concept that is reiterated in chapter after chapter. In addition to major differences in the attitudes toward homosexual acts in Muslim countries and the West, this enlightening book also shows great differences among the Muslim countries themselves, depending upon the degree to which Islamic law is enforced, the impact of different western colonial influences and legal systems, and the sheer impact of cultural variation within so vast a geographic area. There are some keen observations and insights into the socialization of boys in Islamic culture, the status and inaccessibility of women, and sex roles and attitudes toward them.<p>Sexuality and Eroticism Among Males in Moslem Societies captures a sense of the Muslim countries in the process of rapid change--from the anti-modernist and religious fundamentalism of Iran to the attempts in the cities of Turkey to develop a western style gay way of life, with all the difficulties that involves. An engaging book for readers interested in gay studies, anthropologists, orientalists, historians, students of comparative law, and sexologists, it should also be read by anyone in contact with Arabs, Turks, or Persians--as tourists in Muslim countries, social service professionals working with immigrants, or friends of Muslims.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>The first study devoted to male homosexuality among Moslems since Burton's notorious 1885 ""Terminal Essay"" to the Arabian nights. The work emerged from discussions among the European gay community about Moslem immigrants and sex tourism to the Moslem world. The 19 essays include personal accounts, historical and legal treatments, and reviews of literature and film. Paper edition (unseen), $12.95. Annotation c.

It takes an overlooked position, that abortion is not the lesser of two evils but a positive turning point in many women's lives. In addition to absorbing countless studies, Lunneborg talked with more than 100 women who have had abortions as well as with health care workers and counselors. She found that most women do not regret their decision. Many found it to be a key reassessment point in their lives: they looked at the directions their lives were heading, their relationships, their attitudes toward their bodies, their methods of birth control, and they made significant changes. Although definitely prochoice, Lunneborg's effort balances antichoice propaganda that paints women who have abortions as irresponsible and selfish, for the women Lunneborg presents are thoughtful and articulate….Lunneborg says she wrote the book to help women through the abortion decision-making process and to give health care workers and counselors more information when working with patients. But really, it ought to be required reading for anyone embroiled in an abortion debate. <i>Booklist</i></p>
<p>The first book to focus on abortion decision making, this self-help counseling resource takes a decidedly positive stance. Challenging the view that abortion is the lesser of two evils, Patricia Lunneborg maintains that it is moral, life-enhancing, supportive to families, and beneficial to the lives of millions of women. Opposing public opinion that abortion is acceptable only in special cases, she contends that the best reason to have an abortion is simply the desire not to bear an unwanted child. Bashing the concept of the so-called Postabortion Stress Syndrome, she reports positive aftereffects such as feelings of relief, a new sense of control over one's life, and increased maturity. Lunneborg, a retired professor of psychology and women's studies, bases her views on over 100 interviews with women who have had abortions and with abortion providers, as well as research findings and her own experiences. What's more, in these pages she allows women who have had abortions to share what they learned about themselves, how their dreams for education and career were positively affected, how the children they chose to have are benefiting from their decision. Perhaps most important, many of the women tell of tremendous personal growth resulting from making a considered choice to have an abortion--for some, their first major decision.</p>
<p>Clearly stating her perspective at the outset, Lunneborg describes those who have abortions--women of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and walks of life--and who provides the procedure. She offers strategies for making the decision, discusses teenage situations, explains how to use the experience as an opportunity for reassessment and growth, and stresses the value of talking about abortion--both for women who have had the procedure and for other people who are often unaware of the positive effects. A complete presentation, her book also sheds light on counseling before and after an abortion, contraception, family planning, the impact on education and careers, effects on relationships with others, and the work of the dedicated group of people who provide abortions. Throughout, Lunneborg's tone is conversational, warm, easy to read. Indispensable for any woman considering the procedure, Abortion: A Positive Decision also provides invaluable help to women who seek a reaffirming view of past abortion decisions, psychotherapists and counselors, and those who provide abortion services.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1401452 Inches, Weight: 1.22 Pounds, Width: 0.5618099 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/38/9780897892438.jpg,Success,79.0,15.2

The plays, written between the years 1986 and 1991, have been performed or read in theaters across the United States. Questioned in the six plays are the traditions so deeply rooted in the familial culture of which these playwrights are still a part, and equally explored is their need to reinterpret the inherited customs for a new identity in their present bicultural existence. These playwrights battle the myths and stereotypes that continue to circumscribe the freedom of expression and life fulfillment for Hispanic women. Their plays, indeed, shatter myths and in so doing, are creating a broader, freer space for women's identity and cultural development. Compiled by renowned playwright Denise Chavez, the anthology contains: Simply Maria, or The American Dream, by Josefina Lopez; A Dream of Canaries, by Diana Saenz; Shadow of a Man, by Cherrie Moraga; Gleaning/Rebusca, by Caridad Svich; My Visits with MGM, by Edit Villarreal; and Miriam's Flowers, by Migdalia Cruz.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.82 Inches, Weight: 0.83 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches",0.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/15/9781558850415.jpg,Success,77.0,15.2
