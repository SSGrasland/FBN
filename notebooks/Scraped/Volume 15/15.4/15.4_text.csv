to increase awareness of feminist press books, to in-

A Modest Proposal
If just one Firebrand title
(there are 62 to choose from)
was on the required reading list
of just one women’s studies course
(there are some 3,000 nationwide)
in every women’s studies department
(there are over 600 on NWSA's mailing list)
the following could happen:
1. More readers would be exposed to Firebrand’s award-winning feminist and
lesbian literature — ethnically diverse, varied in genre, risk-taking.
2. Increased textbook sales would move us toward the financial stability that
allows our kind of innovative, progressive, feminist publishing to survive.
3. Our greater visibility would help spread the words from independent women’s
presses* — book publishing coming out of, and giving back to, feminist political/
cultural/intellectual work.
Consider the Possibilities.
* Firebrand Books is one of several women-owned and controlled feminist publishing
houses in the U.S. For more information contact your local women’s bookstore or

Evolution & Change:
' By Joan Catapano — that Indiana's feminist publishing program was
Senior Sponsoring Editor, Indiana University Press born. A book entitled Suffer and Be Still, published in
1972, set Indiana on its feminist publishing course.
""In reflecting on the history and evolution of fem-
inist publishing — more specifically feminist schol-
arly publishing — I recalled a discussion I
participated in five years ago at the annual meeting of
the Association of American University Presses. In
that presentation, I proclaimed the impact of feminist
scholarship and the explosion of feminist publishing.
At that conference, I discovered that almost every
university press in the U.S. had jumped on the band-
wagon of women’s studies publishing. Today, how-
ever, in some quarters there is the sense that the
feminist scholarly publishing engine is stalling. Not
only do the number of feminist titles seem fewer, they
often seem less interesting than in the past. eeuneg
At Indiana University Press, the publication of
feminist studies titles reached a peak in 1987 when 21
feminist books were issued. In 1992 Indiana will again
publish 21 feminist titles. Although the number of
feminist titles has not decreased, the overall number
of titles on the list has increased by 30 books this year.
These numbers confirm my sense that over the past
few years feminist publishing at Indiana, and at other
scholarly publishers, has reached a plateau or perhaps
a crossroads. Although a publishing program can, I
believe, have an impact on society and culture, that
program in turn is influenced by social and political
currents. Perhaps this publishing development is a
reflection of the much-discussed phenomenon of Most of the current Press staff were not even involved

My own belief and hope is that these phenomena
are examples of the success of feminist theory and

Columbia Editor Resigns:
Charges Censorship
Richard Mohr has resigned as editor of Columbia
University’s lesbian and gay book series, charging
nine university presses with censorship in their treat-
ment of his forthcoming book Gay Ideas: Outing and
Other Controversies.
Mohr, who founded the Columbia series ”Be-
tween Men — Between Women: Lesbian and Gay
Studies,” is a professor of philosophy at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His criticisms, pub-
lished in the July 15 Chronicle of Higher Education, stem
from his efforts to find a publisher for Gay Ideas.
Mohr writes that the book, despite being enthusi-
astically received by referees, was rejected by presses
on the basis of illustrations for a chapter analyzing
homoerotic art.
Mohr states, ”...the images caused the manuscript
to crash and burn through university presses. I found
that the presses no longer fulfill their responsibility to

stead of credit after six months, so be sure to ask.)
Again, if there are any problems, call the professors.
They can change the syllabus if a book is out of stock.
Sandi even checks in with professors if a book seems
unusually pricey.
It’s extremely important when selling textbooks
to order the full amount, particularly if the store has
an exclusive order. “Don’t underorder,” Sandi says.
“You can't restock quickly and you'll be perceived as
doing a bad job. It’s much better to return.” (Note: One
exception to this case is if you know you can get the
book quickly through a wholesaler.) If in doubt about
how much to order, Sandi will call the department
office to check on class enrollment figures. When A
Room of One's Own discovers it has a large overstock,
it returns the books right away, before the bill is due.
Also, never mark textbooks above the suggested retail
price. The university store will undersell you and
you'll look bad, Sandi warns.
Sandi keeps all textbook orders separate so she
can easily track which books have arrived, which have
disappeared into the publishers’ order void. Most ti-
tles arrive in two to three weeks.
Even though the books arrive in August, A Room
of One's Own usually doesn’t display them until the
first day of classes. It’s a form of self-protection. “Be
aware that the local textbook store will not like you
competing for textbook business,” Sandi says. “The
university store has even been known to send spies to
check out our store and then air-freight in texts to sell.
They’d rather lose money and undermine us than let
A Room of One's Own get the sales.... They think that
if they make it as difficult as possible we might stop.”
Though not displaying titles until the first day of
classes may cause a few problems with people who
want to buy books in advance, Sandi has found nega-
tive reactions can be avoided by explaining the situa-
tion to professors and students.
A Room of One’s Own generally starts returning
books after about six weeks. Most textbook publish-

the travelers was the fact that so many Dutch women
could read.
The Dutch remain great readers not only of their
own writers, but of the world’s: one quarter of all the
books published in the Netherlands are translations.
And Dutch women are continuing to write and pub-
lish as never before. Writers such as Marion Bloem,
Renate Dorrestein, Tessa De Loo and Hella S. Haasse
are well-known inside the Netherlands, and in parts
of Belgium and South Africa where Dutch-based lan-
guages such as Flemish and Afrikaans are spoken.
This is despite the fact that publishing in Dutch is a
risky business: few people outside the Netherlands
read Dutch. If an author wants to reach beyond the
small Dutch market and establish an international
reputation, translation is essential. Dutch publishers
may be willing to spend time and money on transla-
tion, but many other publishers are not.

small,” said Scott Rollins of the Dutch press In De In De Knipscheer is a small press. It is also the

Oa S O|
By Carol Seajay
No matter how many wonderful books are pub-
lished, it’s still the periodicals that carry the most
current ideas, the most important (if not most popu-
lar) ideas, that support the debates that lead to good
theory, that create community among unique groups
of women, and give new writers their first exposure.
Periodical publishing, if not affordable for ev-
eryone, is more financially accessible than other as-
pects of the women-in-print movement. Magazines
are labor — rather than cash — intensive. In these
days of desktop publishing, access to a computer
and money for a copy shop bill are the essentials —
much cheaper than setting up a bookstore or pub-
lishing books.
On the other hand, cashflow is also the hardest
for magazines. Most newspapers and magazines (like
TV shows) are supported by advertising (a practice
that severely limits the “news” we hear) but there are
still too few advertisers who see the value in advertis-
ing products to (disenfranchised groups of) women to
support most feminist magazines. Billing individual
stores for sales (usually consignment) is also very
labor intensive — for both the periodical and the
bookseller. Distributors like Inland and Bookpeople
are godsends for both the bookseller and the maga-
zine — but they take a high percent of the after-book-
store-discount revenue. Subscriptions are often the
key to magazines’ survival, but without major promo-
tion budgets (and I've yet to meet a feminist magazine
that’s got one) often the best way to find new subscrib- doing in feminist bookstores — making information

Banshee’s Women, CAPSIZED in the Coral Sea
by Jeannine Talley
Jeannine Talley, author of Women at the Helm, gives readers more gripping
sea adventures with her latest book Banshee’ s Women Capsized in the Coral
Sea. Jeannine and her partner, Joy Smith, in their 34-foot sailboat, Banshee,
were capsized and dismasted in a terrible storm off the east coast of Australia.
Joy's leg was hurt in the roll-over and they called for rescue. Jeannine and Joy,
in spite of her injury, managed to get out on deck in incredible winds and seas
to cut away the broken mast and rigging. After four days of being wildly tossed
about, they were found and rescued first by a cargo ship and then by helicopters
flown out from Australia, 450 miles away. The women were forced to abandon
Banshee in mid-Pacific. But the story doesn’t end there. Two intrepid Austra-
lians found and towed the Banshee back to Australia and generously returned the
boat to her two owners. Welcoming Banshee back with joy, the women began
the year-long painstaking task of rebuilding her to cruise again.

Meditations & Blessings
from a different dimension
by Dorothy “Mike” Brinkman
When Dorothy “Mike” Brinkman, a mature, practical somewhat skeptical
social worker and a member of the women’s community in a large, midwestern
city, began to experiment with automatic writing (channeling), she was very
surprised by the messages she received. The writings were simple and profound
and ultimately, simply profound. After sharing these writings with women’s
groups for two years, Mike published Welcome to the Home of Your Heart.
Now, with this new publication, the meditations and blessings that were
sprinkled throughout the first volume are collected into another special and
useful book. The inspired and empowering meditations may be used by women's
KAA spirituality and therapy groups that implement guided meditation. They may
also be used by individuals who tape record the instructions. The blessings can
to Dorothy “Mike” Brinkman be used any time, any where.

A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP, by Jennifer L. Jordan
Destiny Greaves, a well-known activist and “the most famous lesbian

the detective to find her childhood. Because Destiny has no memory of
her parents (who died when she was four), she hires Kristin to
reconstruct the early years of her life. This seeming simply task

women conclude their incredible search, which ends in a thought-pro-
