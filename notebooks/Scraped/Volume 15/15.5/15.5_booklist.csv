What do they wear? Why are some like me and some different?"" Children are full of questions about other places and the people who live in them. <b>The People Atlas</b>, a clearly written, beautifully illustrated survey of human life around the world, gives them many of the answers.<br>
 In 64 pages of text, maps, and full-color pictures, <b>The People Atlas</b> shows how human beings spread around the world, outlines their different languages, traditions, and life-styles, and explains the impact they have had on the world around them. Combining a continent-by-continent survey with special sections that compare local expressions of the fundamental elements of human culture—food, spoken and written language, clothing, homes and family life, money—the book offers young readers both a ready reference and a compelling stimulus to further thought and deeper understanding. In addition, each section features the kind of ""fun facts"" that children love (the tallest and shortest people on earth, the highest capital, how much rain forest has disappeared since you started reading this sentence), making the main points even more concrete, vivid, and easy to remember.<br>
 Clear and direct yet richly detailed, <b>The People Atlas</b> is an ideal first reference for children exploring the world's sometimes overwhelming diversity.</p>


                        <p>Text and map spreads explore the peoples of the world and their culture, continent by continent.

Boswell reveals unexplored phenomena with an unfailing erudition.&#8212;Michel Foucault John Boswell's National Book Award-winning study of the history of attitudes toward homosexuality in the early Christian West was a groundbreaking work that challenged preconceptions about the Church's past relationship to its gay members&#8212;among them priests, bishops, and even saints&#8212;when it was first published twenty-five years ago. The historical breadth of Boswell's research (from the Greeks to Aquinas) and the variety of sources consulted make this one of the most extensive treatments of any single aspect of Western social history. <i>Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality</i>, still fiercely relevant today, helped form the disciplines of gay and gender studies, and it continues to illuminate the origins and operations of intolerance as a social force.<BR>What makes this work so exciting is not simply its content&#8212;fascinating though that is&#8212;but its revolutionary challenge to some of Western culture's most familiar moral assumptions.&#8212;Jean Strouse, <i>Newsweek</i><p></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",17.87,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/17/9780226067117.jpg,Success,80.0,15.5

Her intimate, often painfully revealing self-portraits have become contemporary icons. In life, she was a bejeweled, exotically draped, glamorous presence. But it was her face that mesmerized people, especially the parade of photographers who sought her out as a subject. In this collection of 70 photographs of Frida Kahlo, many never before published, taken from her childhood until her death in 1954, she is shown as innocent, comic, seductress, political activist, and mystery. Photographers as diverse as Ansel Adams, Nicolas Muray, Gisele Freund, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, and Imogen Cunningham attempted to penetrate the mask. But what each photographer was drawn into was a less-than-equal collaboration in which Kahlo was always the winner. Thick trademark eyebrows over piercing eyes, sealed lips, upswept braided hair, and regal deportment defied photographic interpretation but guaranteed portraits that would seduce. Who was Frida? For the millions who have been fascinated by her powerful allure, here are the clues, embedded in a sequence of haunting and enigmatic portraits.",en,1st Edition,"Height: 11.8 Inches, Length: 9.6 Inches, Width: 0.7 Inches",29.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/83/9780811802383.jpg,Success,75.0,15.5
