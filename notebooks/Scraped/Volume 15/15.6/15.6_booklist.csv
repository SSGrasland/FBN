Judith Mayne examines how spectatorship emerged in the 1970s as one of the major preoccupations of film theorists, particularly in relation to theories of the subject drawn from psychoanalysis and semiotics. She suggests that while 1970s film theory insisted on the separation between the cinematic subject and actual film viewers, interest in spectatorship has been characterized by a very real friction between ""subjects"" and ""viewers."" She evaluates challenges to and revisions of 1970s theory, from feminist analyses of female spectatorship to historical explorations of how the film-spectator relationship is shaped by particular cultural factors.
<p>In the first section Mayne examines three theoretical models of spectatorship: the perceptual, the institutional, and the historical. The second section presents case studies which focus on textual analysis, the ""disrupting genre,"" ""star-gazing,"" and finally the audience itself. Specific topics include the place of the spectator in <i>The</i> <i>Picture of Dorian Gray</i>; the construction of Bette Davis's star persona; fantasies of race and film viewing in <i>Field of Dreams</i> and <i>Ghost</i>; and gay and lesbian audiences as ""critical"" audiences. <b><i>Cinema and Spectatorship</i></b> provides a thoruogh and accessible overview of this complex, fragmented, and often controversial area of film theory.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.46 Inches",59.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/66/9780415034166.jpg,Success,127.0,15.6

Available for the first time to an English-speaking audience, the book is as illuminating today as it was when it was first released. Marie Langer argues that economic institutions and cultural values must be altered to permit women full participation in creative and productive activities if women are to accept their maternal role without conflict or resentment. Within this context, her work presents a rare exploration of psychosomatic disorders related to female reproductive life. The book demonstrates the centrality of the mother-daughter relationship to each woman's potential to embrace her experience as a sexual being and mother. Combining psychoanalytic theory with fascinating clinical material, chapters cover woman's conflictual relationship to menstruation, sexuality, pregnancy, infertility, childbirth, breast-feeding, and menopause. Withstanding the test of time, Langer's interpretation of the psychological dimension of the causes and meanings of infertility, for example, provides an in-depth treatment of a topic that is even more relevant today than when it was written. Throughout, Nancy Caro Hollander has added critical chapter notes to indicate the changes in Langer's thinking since the book was published and to relate Langer's perspectives to contemporary ideas about female sexuality and motherhood. In addition, Hollander's Introduction and Afterword provide an overview of Langer's life and trace the development of her ideas. Integrating a Kleinian perspective on the unconscious roots of female psychosexual development with a political understanding of the socially constructed impediments to women's equality, this book fills an important gap in the literature. It is valuable reading for psychologists, psychoanalysts, and other mental health professionals interested in questions of femininity, gender identi",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/31/9780898620931.jpg,Success,112.0,15.6

—<i>Sunday Independent</i></p>
<p>""As a document of one woman's revolt against convention and as a celebration of love between women, this is an uplifting book.""<br>
—<i>The Independent</i></p>
<p>Upon publication, the first volume of Anne Lister's diaries, <i>I Know My Own Heart</i>, met with celebration, delight, and some skepticism. How could an upper class Englishwoman, in the first half of the nineteenth century, fulfill her emotional and sexual needs when her sexual orientation was toward other women? How did an aristocratic lesbian manage to balance sexual fulfillment with social acceptability?</p>
<p>Helena Whitbread, the editor of these diaries, here allows us an inside look at the long-running love affair between Anne Lister and Marianna Lawton, an affair complicated by Anne's infatuation with Maria Barlow. Anne travels to Paris where she discovers a new love interest that conflicts with her developing social aspirations. For the first time, she begins to question the nature of her identity and the various roles female lovers may play in the life of a gentrywoman. Though unequipped with a lesbian vocabulary with which to describe her erotic life, her emotional conflicts are contemporary enough to speak to us all.</p>
<p>This book will satisfy the curiosity of the many who became acquainted with Lister through <i>I Know My Own Heart</i> and are eager to learn more about her revealing life and what it suggests about the history of sexuality.</p>",en,1,,45.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/66/9780814750766.jpg,Success,60.0,15.6

But the convention is startled by the appearance of a writer who was supposed to have died thirty years ago. Then murder materializes to throw the agenda further into chaos. Now, Jay Omega, author of Bimbos of the Death Sun, and his significant other, Dr. Marion Farley, must separate science fact from fiction -- and unearth a killer with a story of his own to tell.

Amazon Dream is the real story of a woman's journey into the Peruvian Amazon, a mysteriously beautiful region of the world that is also the nexus of calamitous ecological realities. Traveling alone, she arrives at a so-called conservation camp, run by a man of dubious character, and learns what jungle life is like. Here she encounters bizarre characters, Peruvians and exiles alike. She visits the ancient Shipibo people renowned for their textiles and pottery and describes the way rapid change has affected them.</p>
<p>In hair-raising predicaments and emotional interactions, Allen continually challenges herself as a traveler. She confronts her ambivalence about coming from a dominant Western culture and, at the same time, looks for personal truths through the lens of this compelling wilderness. Situating her experiences in a cultural context, Allen conveys insight into other ways of life, and into the life of real dreams.</p>
<p>Roberta Allen is the author of The Traveling Woman, stories; and The Daughter, a novella-in-stories. She is also a visual artist who has exhibited worldwide.</p>

While Maintaining Full Control Of Her Plot's Variously Colored Threads, Many Of Which Are Tied To Jaffe's Family (his 18-year-old Son Is On The Lam From A Murder Charge), Grafton Cameos Such Familiar Characters As Kinsey's Octogenarian Landlord Henry, His Older Brother William, And Rose, The Neighborhood Bar Owner. But The Spotlight Remains On Kinsey Who, Without A Love Interest To Distract Her, Sticks To The Case At Hand And Tries, With Limited Success, To Assimilate The Existence Of A Not Too Distant Family, Whom Readers Will Likely Learn More Of In ``k.'' 500,000 First Printing; Major Ad/promo; Literary Guild Selection; Author Tour.

She was fifty-three years old and walked with a crutch. She walked because not even mules could climb the mountain trails. Mrs. DeGraf was one of the first white women to live on the northern frontier. She watched the frenzies of the gold rush, and observed ""We got used to 30 and 40 below zero, and didn't think much about such weather, but when the thermometer dropped to 60 and 70 below, one could feel it."" She befriended showgirls, native peoples and miners; she was known as ""Mother"" to tenderfeet and lawmen. She ate salad under the midnight sun and hostessed a Shakespeare reading on Christmas eve. She ran a number of stores, outwitted a number of crooks, and wasn't eaten by bears. After twenty-five years, Anna DeGraf returned to the lower 48 for good, having heard of her great granddaughter's birth, and wrote her memoirs at age eighty-six, hoping (in vain) her lost son ""may read these words."" Hers is the story of America's last frontier. It's also a memoir by and about one of history's most extraordinary people. And her daily life is almost Bunyanesque in its vitality - though the tales are true. The manuscript, illustrations, and a poke of Alaska gold, were found in a trunk many years after her death by members of her family.

                        <p>Anna DeGraf, an independent pioneer, recounts her twenty-five years of adventure in Alaska and the Yukon Territory before, during, and after the Gold Rush.

In spite of his feelings, Afra remained loyal to the Rowan. He stayed by her side and helped to raise her Talented daughter, Damia. Now years later, Damia is a full-grown Talent of great power. Terrible alien voices echo within her mind. And a wondrous new feeling for Afra is growing within her heart...<P>In a universe under seige, only one thing can defeat the power of fear&#58; the power of love.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this second volume of the trilogy begun with The Rowan , McCaffrey introduces Damia Raven, brilliant and willful daughter of Angharad Gwyn (the Rowan) and Jeff Raven, leaders of the psionic Talents of Federal Telepath & Teleport, who make interstellar commerce possible. The precocious Damia's difficult childhood is made tolerable by the care and solicitude of Afra Lyon, her parents' valued friend and assistant, who secretly loves the child as much as he did her mother. Maturing as a Prime--the most powerful of the orders of psis--Damia is sent to run the FT&T Tower on the new colony of Iota Aurigae. She lives there in petulant loneliness, having rejected or alienated all Talented potential mates, until she touches the alien mind of Sodan, many light-years away. Concerned about an alien invasion like the one suffered a generation previously, her family sends Afra to evaluate the dangers of Damia's infatuation. In a forceful resolution, Damia suffers a deep loss but finds her salvation. McCaffrey interweaves an engrossing romance with a coming-of-age story as she examines the issue of responsibility in a society where survival depends on the abilities of a gifted few.

From her vantage point as a birth attendant, Dwinell recounts the moving birth experiences of twenty different women. Thus the reader learns that there are no right or wrong ways to give birth. In fact, the author shows how satisfying it can be for women to exercise their own strength, power and choice in the birth process instead of yielding to unnecessary technological and medical interventions. Birth, she says, is a process of wellness, not illness. Hence, most women don't need medication to help them deal with normal birth pains if they have the proper empowering support during labor.</p>
<p>When women give birth in a comfortable setting of their choice, the medical wrongs against them, committed in hospitals in the name of safety and technology, are prevented. In the face of opposition from an entrenched segment of the medical establishment, Dwinell dares the view that hospital care should not be routine but should be given only with good reason and the women's permission. For pregnant women and their partners, <i>Birth Stories</i> makes a convincing argument that under normal circumstances wach women's intuitive knowledge and individual resources can help her to labor and deliver successfully in her own way. Nurses, midwives, doctors, and birth educators will find it useful to realize that there are many ways to give birth . . . that it is important for the family to be together and make their own choices . . . and that pregnant women can have safe births without excessive medical intervention. This book can also serve as a guide for professionals who want to develop this type of birthing model within their own institution.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5621787681 Pounds, Width: 0.3909441 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/46/9780897893046.jpg,Success,100.0,15.6

Now, suddenly and inexplicably, the top Iditarod contestants are dying one by one in bizarre and gruesome ways. Jessie Arnold, Alaska's premier female ""musher,"" fears she may be the next intended victim, but nothing is going to prevent her from aggressively pursuing the glory and the rewards that victory brings.<p>Dedicated State Trooper Alex Jensen is determined to track down the murderer before more innocent blood stains the pristine Alaskan snow. But Jensen's hunt is leading him into the frozen heart of the perilous wild that Jessie Arnold knows so well&#151;-a merciless place far from any vestige of civilization, where nature can kill as fast as a bullet...and only the Arctic night can hear your final screams.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this enthralling debut mystery, someone is killing the mushers (dog sled racers) competing in Alaska's internationally famous Iditarod--a 1000-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. The first victim's face is ripped off during a freak accident. Later, state trooper Sgt. Alex Jensen, assigned to the routine investigation of an apparently accidental death, learns that the deceased had been drugged and unconscious moments before his sled crashed. As the two-week run in sub-zero cold continues, the second victim is crushed by a rigged dog sled and the third is eaten alive by doped huskies. The $250,000 prize money makes Jensen consider all the competing mushers as suspects; however, as more fall prey to mysterious injuries, he realizes that the killer is after more than cash. While the list of suspects dwindles, pitiless Arctic snowstorms immobilize Jensen's search and leave the surviving racers at the mercy of the killer. Henry provides suspense and excitement in this paean to a great sporting event and to the powerful Alaskan landscape.

By Taking Apart Patriarchal Social Constructs, Dr. Waites Examines How Women Are Beset On Every Side With Double Binds, Which Force Them To Adopt Coping Mechanisms That Help Integrate These Contradictory Messages Into A Liveable Reality. Often, These Mechanisms Are Not Recognized As Being Pathological Or Adaptive Because They Fit With The Perception Of The Good Woman.^ In A Perceptive And Penetrating Opening Chapter, She Makes Explicit The Causal Link Between Trauma And Female Disorders Such As Borderline Personality Disorder, Dissociative Disorders, Multiple Personality Disorder, And Depression. This Link Is Often Not Seen, Because The More Benign Connection Between Cultural Programming And Garden-variety Female Behavior (forgetfulness, Hysteria, Overemotionality, Dependence) Is Not Made. She Then Goes On To Cover Diagnosis And Treatment Of Trauma-related Disorders, With Chapters On Ptsd In Rape, Battering, And Incest, And In The Dissociative Disorders. Included Also Is A Chapter That Focuses On Professional Ethics, Particularly Therapist Motives And Implications Of Diagnosis. The Book Concludes By Addressing Special Issues In Therapy, Including Iatrogenic Symptoms, Revictimization, Therapy With Patients Who Self-injure, Victims Of Ritualized Abuse, And Enactment In The Session.^ This Book Refutes The Centuries-old Idea That There Is A Gender-related Biological Imperative In Female Mental Health, While Offering A Rational And Sound Model For Diagnosing And Treating Traumatized Women. Intended Primarily For Therapists Who Work In A Variety Of Treatment Settings With Female Victims Of Violence, It Will Be Useful To Any Clinician Who Treats Women And Who Is Sensitive To The Impact Of Sexism On Their Lives.

""Rich and poor, middle-aged and young...out of the pain at the loss of a cherished husband and child, or the boredom of aristocratic social life, or the shattering power of a mystic vision, or the simple but incorrigible habit of giving shelter for the night to the homeless,"" each woman answered the ""jarring, life-disturbing call to abandon oneself to God."" Meehan shows the sources and qualities of their holiness, how each woman represented a particular aspect of Orthodox spirituality, and how aspects of women's religious ideals, including community, service, and reconciliation, marked the religious communities they founded. In studying their lives we see virtures embodies, dark undersides redeemed, and the daily struggle of community life. ""I have called these women holy,"" Meehan writes, ""holy in the ordinary sense of the word, meaning people leading devout and godly lives dedicated to the service of God. None of them is considered an official saint of the church...But these women were held up in their time as exemplars of the holy life, models of holiness deserving of imitation. And their stories speak to us even today, for as John Coleman has said of saints, 'they invite us to conceptuzlize our lives in terms other than mastery, usefulness, autonomy, and control.' These women believed, and shock us into believing, in a world in which virture has meaning.""",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 2.4 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",17.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/26/9780060654726.jpg,Success,117.0,15.6

We meet Sappho at the age of fifty, when she is shaken by her fatal and final love affair with Phaon. She narrates her own story from the vantage point of self-questioning middle age, and her candid meditations make intimate, engrossing reading.<br>
Only fragments of Sappho's poetry survive.<br>
In imagining Sappho's life Green found his task ""rather like that of an archaeologist reassembling some amphora from hundreds of shards—of which more than half are missing."" Yet, in his synthesis of historical evidence and ebullient invention, Green produces a seamless, moving, and persuasive portrait. He recreates Sappho's life by interweaving her surviving poetry into the narrative, not as quotations, but as her own imagined speeches and thoughts.<br>
Sappho's life spanned one of the most exciting periods in Greek history. Green's novel, full of details about daily life on ancient Lesbos, draws the reader into the political and social climate of her world: the civil strife accompanying the transition from aristocracy to mercantilism, the household relations between slave and aristocrat, the details of sea travel in the Aegean. Green wrote the novel while living on Lesbos, and his graceful rendering of the landscape, the rhythms of the seasons, and the varied flora of Sappho's island pervades the narrative.<br>
Sappho's poetry reveals a direct, spontaneous woman who eschewed artifice and embellishment. Green's extraordinary talent captures those qualities and brings this woman of unflinching honesty very much to life.</p>


                        <p>Scholar, historian, novelist, and professor of classics at the University of Texas (Austin), Peter Green recreates the life and times of the Greek lyric poet Sappho. The surviving fragments of Sappho's poetry reveal a mature woman of unflinching honesty. Sappho and her daily life on the island of ancient Lesbos are brought vividly to life via Green's extraordinary talent. This work was first published in 1965.

Now in this extraordinary memoir, she relates a tale as fascinating, and as moving, as any work of fiction. At the center of Sinclair's story is her relationship with Helen Buchman, a middle-class wife and mother with a passion for literature and gardening. The two women couldn't have been more different: Buchman, despite suffering from diabetes, was self-assured, cultured, stable. Sinclair, on the other hand, was a product of the Jewish ghetto, carrying a host of emotional and spiritual scars. Nevertheless, when Buchman invited the young woman into her home in the 1940s, the two developed an intense relationship. Buchman became both best friend and mentor, encouraging Sinclair's writing and passing along a sense of the spiritual nature of gardening. The book deals not only with these early formative years but also with Sinclair's struggle to accept her friend's death in 1963, her triumph over alcoholism, and her ultimate transfiguration as an accomplished author.</p>                        <p>As a novelist concerned with women's issues, Sinclair has won coveted literary prizes and a devoted following.
