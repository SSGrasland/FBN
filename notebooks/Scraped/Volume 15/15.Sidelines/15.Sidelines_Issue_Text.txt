caution, if your artwork is being printed on a 300 dots
per inch laser printer, watch out for 10% screens. Some-
times, the dot pattern is so light that when the screen is
reproduced at the printer's, much of it fades off the
page. Unfortunately, 20% screens are too dark if you're
putting a large body of copy over the screen.

1993 Chinese Women Artists Calendar
This unique art calendar introduces the folk paint-
ings of Chinese peasant women, works which are
now gaining positive recognition throughout the CHINESE WOMEN
world. These women, ranging in age from 18 to over
80, usually work and live in farming communes,
painting in their spare time. Although much of their
lives are filled with daily work routines done with-
out the benefit of many modern conveniences, their
creative spirit, love of life, nature and community
are expressed with brilliant colors, decorative mo-
tifs and scenes of daily life and festivities. Includes
Chinese, American, Jewish and Christian holidays.

This is a new series of color notecards.
They are reproductions from original oil paint-
ings of the eight sabbats by Sudie Rakusin.
Each painting personifies one sabbat and
holds the symbols, phase of the moon, time of
day, the feeling of the season, what is growing
or being harvested, etc. against a background
color of the corresponding chakra.
There are eight sabbats —
Winter Solstice, Candlemas, Spring Equinox,
Beltane/May Eve, Summer Solstice, Lammas,
Autumn Equinox and Hallomas. Each card is as
detailed as this sample.
Ordering information:
Minimum order of one card is one dozen/$12.
(suggested retail $2 each)
Net 30 days. Bookstore pays postage.
