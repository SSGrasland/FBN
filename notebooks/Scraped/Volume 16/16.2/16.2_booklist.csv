0-935480-63-3,City of Kings (Discoveries),"Castellanos, Rosario",Latin American Literary Review Press,144.0,1993-01-01,,Paperback,"<p>Ciudad Real, as the Mexican city of San Cristobal de las Casas was called in earlier times, is the setting for this 1960 collection of stories by Rosario Castellanos that treats the passionate and timely themes of race, class, power and language. Set in the southern region of Chiapas where Castellanos was born, City of Kings [Ciudad Real] explores the centuries-old domination of indigenous people by whites, and the complex relationship between conquerors and conquered that is its outcome. Each story weaves into the next to present a portrait of the men, women and children of the region, with their hopes, tragedies, beliefs and fears. Most of all, City of Kings reveals the pain and damage suffered by both the weak and the strong when exploitation is the basis for everyday life.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>These short stories, first published in Mexico in 1960, show Castellanos to be a first-rate writer whose understanding of Mexican culture is as disturbing as it is engrossing. Using the city of Ciudad Real--the eponymous City of Kings, once glorious but now ``a vain, empty shell''--as a unifying element, she explores how racism, hunger, religion and money become weapons for the rulers of a society built upon the domination of native peoples. An elderly woman bludgeons an Indian to death, but calms her fears that his spirit will haunt her by thinking, ``How could a spirit possibly appear if the body belonged to an Indian, and not to a rational person?'' A proud native tribe and its protective spirit are exterminated by Spanish oligarchs and their descendants. A baby dies of hunger, yet the doctor who allows it to happen proclaims it a victory in getting Indians to understand the value of ``white'' medicine. A subtle paradox inhabits these unrelenting stories: Castellanos (1925-1974) was herself a wealthy ladina or white woman of mixed (European and indigenous) ancestry. She manages her exposure of the racist underpinnings of society brilliantly; more than 30 years after these stories were written, the inhumanity they portray continues to chill the soul.

Gathering essays by sixteen critics working within the perspective of gay and lesbian studies, this collection redraws the map of sexuality and gender studies in the Renaissance. Taken together, these essays move beyond limiting notions of identity politics by locating historically forms of same-sex desire that are not organized in terms of modern definitions of homosexual and heterosexual.<br>
	The presence of contemporary history can be felt throughout the volume, beginning with an investigation of the uses of Renaissance precedents in the 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>, to a piece on the foundations of 'our' national imaginary, and an afterword that addresses how identity politics has shaped the work of early modern historians. The volume examines canonical and noncanonical texts, including highly coded poems of the fifteenth-century Italian poet Burchiello, a tale from Marguerite de Navarre's <u>Heptameron</u>, and Erasmus's letters to a young male acolyte. English texts provide a central focus, including works by Spenser, Shakespeare, Bacon, Donne, Beaumont and Fletcher, Crashaw, and Dryden. Broad suveys of the complex terrains of friendship and sodomy are explored in one essay, while another offers a cross-cultural reading of the discursive sites of lesbian desire.<br>
	Accessibly written, boldly interdisciplinary, <i>Queering the Renaissance</i> will be indispensable for literary critics, historians, and theorists seeking to understand the representation of same-sex desire in the early modern period.</p>

Trained as an analytic philosopher at a time before women or feminist ideas were welcome in the field, Martin brought a philosopher's detachment to her earliest efforts at revolutionizing the curriculum. Her later essays on women and gender further showcase the tremendous intellectual energy she brought to the field of feminist educational theory. Martin explores the challenges and contradictions posed by the very concept of women's education, and also recognizes how the presence of women necessitates the rearticulation of not only the curriculum but also the standard ideologies in education.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 1.0582188576 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches",54.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/58/9780415907958.jpg,Success,131.0,16.2

In the '50s he worked in London and Paris; and for many years he occupied a special place in the San Francisco Bay Area as a performer, playwright and professor.

<p><i>The Planet Pirates</i> traces the careers of two remarkable women. Sassinak escaped from slavery to freedom, and then used that freedom to fight the evil that had wrecked her world, first as a cadet, later as a captain, and finally as an Admiral of the Fleet.</p>
<p>Lunzie, one of the galaxy's greatest healers, is Sassinak's great-grandmother -- but in actual years she is her junior; Lunzie spent nearly a century in coldsleep waiting for rescue when her ship was destroyed. Imagine their mutual surprise when Sassinak rescued her.</p>
<p>How together Sassinak and Lunzie save first a world, and then a confederation of worlds -- and almost in passing establish amity between the genetically engineered Heavy Worlders and normal humanity -- is the story of <i>The Planet Pirates.</i></p>

By examining incest from a critical Foucauldian framework she considers how feminist discourse on incest itself fits into existing ways of talking about sex.

Her confidant is Sheriff Sam DeGheyn and what they have in common is obsession. Maude doesn't want her son to leave home, and Sam cannot let go of the unsolved murders of three local women &#151; or his intuition that the killer is still out there. How these lives intertwine reveals a rich and startling story of parents and children and the pain they cause one another.<br>&quot;Gripping.&quot;<br>CHICAGO SUN TIMES</p> <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3> <p>Something completely different from the author of the popular, ever-so-British Inspector Jury mysteries (The Old Contemptibles, etc.). This time the setting is small-town America, the mystery is secondary (a psycho serial-killer of sporadic interest), and the emphasis instead is on earnest character-studies that never quite add up. The primary character under scrutiny is Maud Chadwick, a divorc,e in her late 40s who works as a diner waitress in sleepy La Porte, a town somewhere considerably ""up north"" from N.Y.C. Maud, dreamy and depressed, spends her free time obsessing about son Chad, 20, whose increasing adult-ness and separate-ness devastate her. She whiles away her summer evenings sitting at the end of her backyard pier&#151;fantasizing about the rich summerfolk who party across the lake, puzzling over Wallace Stevens's poetry, and chatting (edgily yet amiably) with La Porte's sheriff, Sam DeGheyn, himself lonely in his lousy marriage to unfaithful Florence. Sam, meanwhile, has his own obsession&#58; the savage murders of four local ""loose women"" over the past few years, crimes not solved to Sam's satisfaction (despite the conviction of young ""Boy"" Chalmers for some of the killings). And indeed Grimes introduces us, without naming names, to the real psycho-killer, through run-of-the-mill interior monologues. She also interjects&#151;with far less coherence&#151;a long episode in which young Chad visits the stately home of a decadent college-pal and gets entangled in the family's glitzy, dreary pathology. (This section reads like a watery American imitation of Brideshead Revisited.) At its best, atmospheric psychological suspense reminiscent of L.R. Wright. At its worst, apretentious mishmash&#58; though linked by a theme (parent-child relationships), the pieces don't fit satisfyingly together&#151;and Maud's ultra-sensitivity has limited appeal. Still, Grimes writes fetchingly at times, has a large following (much of which will be plenty disappointed), and a first printing of 100,000 copies is planned.<P></p>",en,~,"Height: 6.87 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.27 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",7.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/72/9780345376572.jpg,Success,87.0,16.2

In her analyses of such tyrants as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Nicolae Ceausescu, Miller reveals the fascinating links between the horrors of their childhoods and the horrors they inflicted on the world. In this new edition, Miller pleads for universal awareness of the ways in which traumatic childhoods influence our lives. She also shares details about her own life that explain her profound interest in emotional growth. A poignant and hopeful book, Breaking Down the Wall of Silence is an essential exploration of trauma and recovery.

                        <p>Eminent psychotherapist Alice Miller continues her study of the roots and results of child abuse, an inquiry begun in such bestselling works as The Drama of the Gifted Child and Thou Shalt Not Be Aware. Miller looks at why society suppresses the truth and how we can break the cycle.

When a woman returns to her Midwestern hometown as an artist-in-residence to teach puppetry to schoolchildren, her homecoming also means dealing with memories of racism, rejected love&#151;and truths about her family. Author readings.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In her first novel, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Dove (<i>Grace Notes</i>) covers territory familiar from her poems. Virginia King, a talented young black woman, returns to her hometown of Akron, Ohio, as artist-in-residence at an elementary school. The story moves back and forth between the present, which finds her teaching puppetry to children, and her past, which includes memories of a constricting community and family life and the liberation offered by college and her stint with a communal puppet theater. Poets turned novelists often rely too heavily on lyricism and imagery to sustain them, to the detriment of plot and exposition; Dove, however, leans a little too far in the opposite direction. The narrative is smooth and accomplished, but takes few risks. The climactic love scene, for example, ends in the disappointment of cliche (""When he touched her again their bodies merged into one long, yearning curve, and the sea rose up to meet them''), and the novel's single real surprise, a revelation of incest, is less shocking than puzzling and unprepared for. Virginia seems to gain knowledge &#151; without being deeply changed by it. Dove could have experimented more daringly with her obvious narrative gifts.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 0.52470018356 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/01/9780679742401.jpg,Success,128.0,16.2

Alice Hoffman In the middle of the twenty-first century, life as we know it has changed for all time. Shira Shipman's marriage has broken up, and her young son has been taken from her by the corporation that runs her zone, so she has returned to Tikva, the Jewish free town where she grew up. There, she is welcomed by Malkah, the brilliant grandmother who raised her, and meets an extraordinary man who is not a man at all, but a unique cyborg implanted with intelligence, emotions--and the ability to kill....<br>
From the imagination of Marge Piercy comes yet another stunning novel of morality and courage, a bold adventure of women, men, and the world of tomorrow.

                        <p>The author of Gone to Soldiers presents a futuristic, feministic novel in the vein of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. In the 21st century, environmental disasters have ravaged the planet's resources and divided the world into corporate enclaves. Her young son taken from her by the corporation, a woman returns to the place where she grew up and meets a unique cyborg, implanted with intelligence, emotions--and the ability to kill.

Selected by Bowles's bibliographer from more than 7,000 letters, In Touch provides an evolving portrait of an artist renowned for his privacy. Yet Bowles was an indefatigable correspondent, and his letters offer a rare look at the many aspects of his brilliant career - as composer, novelist, short-story master, travel writer, translator, ethnographer, and literary critic. From his earliest extant letter, written at the age of four, to his precocious effusions to Aaron Copland and to Gertrude Stein; from his meditations on mescaline as relayed to Ned Rorem, to his intensely moving letters to Jane Bowles during her illness. In Touch fills in the lacunae left by previous biographers and by Bowles's own memoir and journal. Here is Bowles on the genesis of his first novel, The Sheltering Sky; on his distaste for Western melodies and his dogged attempts to record indigenous Moroccan music; on the Beats, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, and Tennessee Williams; on the nature and craft of writing; on Bernardo Bertolucci, David Byrne, and Sting; on the decline of America and the challenges of living in North Africa. Gossipy, reflective, enlightening, and always entertaining, In Touch stands as an epistolary autobiography of one of the legendary writers of our time, and a unique chronicle of the twentieth-century avant-garde.

                        <p>This extraordinary collection of correspondence from the bestselling author of The Sheltering Sky spans 80 years and constitutes an evolving portrait of an artist--author, composer, translator, and ethnographer--renowned for his privacy.

Masuo Yasui arrived in America in 1903 with big dreams and empty pockets. He worked on the railroads, in a cannery and as a houseboy before settling in Hood River, Oregon, to open a store, raise a large family and become one of the area's most successful orchardists. As Masuo tried to break the color barrier in the local business community, his American-born children also strived to overcome it in school, Scouts and sports by excelling in almost everything they took on. But none of their accomplishments could shield them from the intense racism that pervaded much of the West Coast. For the Yasuis' firstborn son, the constraints and contradictions of being both Japanese and American led to tragedy. But his seven brothers and sisters steadfastly pursued the American dream, with one of Masuo's sons becoming Oregon's first Japanese American lawyer and two others becoming surgeons. December 7, 1941, changed the Yasuis' lives completely and forever. Following Pearl Harbor, all West Coast ethnic Japanese, most of whom were U.S. citizens, were forced from their homes with only what they could carry and interned in vast inland relocation camps. Shamed and broken, Masuo eventually took his own life. But the family endured. Today, while many members of the third generation have made their mark in various professions, some are still searching for their place in American society. The Yasui family freely opened its records and its memories to Lauren Kessler, who has written a living work of social history that rings with the power of truth and surpasses the drama of fiction. Stubborn Twig is a moving saga about not only the promise but also the perils of America and the meaning of becoming and being an American.                        <p>A moving story of the promise, perils, and meaning of becoming American. Masuo Yasui emigrated from Japan, settling in Hood River, Oregon, in 1903. This is the story of his family, his children, and their children--a chronicle of struggle, success, and suicide.

This Volume Offers The First Retrospective Examination Of Her Life's Work, Which Spanned Some Seventy Years, And Features Many Previously Unpublished, Remarkable Images. This Definitive Review Is Drawn Primarily From Cunningham's Archives At The Imogen Cunningham Trust, The Most Complete Collection Of Her Prints And Negatives In The World. As An Early But Undeclared Feminist, Cunningham Was One Of The First Women To Make A Successful Living As A Photographer. She Established A Professional Studio In Seattle In 1910, And During This Early Period, She Created Not Only Commercial Portraiture But A Body Of Pictorialist Imagery Often Based On Poetic And Allegorical Themes - Although Her Use Of Nude Male And Female Figures Was Considered Scandalous. After Moving To California In 1917, Cunningham Developed A Keener, More Penetrating Vision, Exemplified By Her Botanical And Nude Figure Studies Of The 1920s. Her Experiments With Multiple Imagery And Double Exposure Throughout The 1920s And 1930s Defined Her As The Most Sophisticated, Experimental, And Europe-oriented Photographer On The West Coast. Imogen Cunningham Chronicles The Photographer's Friendships With Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Alfred Stieglitz, And Dorothea Lange, As Well As Her Portrait Sessions With Leading Artists, Musicians, And Dancers. Her Stylistic Evolution Toward A Humanistic, Documentary Street Photography And The Development Of Her Signature Environmental Portraiture Are Well Illustrated By Many Compelling And Eloquent Images. More Than 120 Duotone Plates Reveal The Extraordinary And Eclectic Range Of Her Landscapes, Architectural Studies, Still Lifes, And Portraiture. By The Time Of Her Death In 1976 At The Age Of Ninety-three, Cunningham Had Become A Living Legend. Photography Had Come To Be Taken As A Serious Art Form, And Imogen Was Its Reigning Queen. The Images In This Book Form A Testament To Her Life's Work, Her Spirit, And Her Complex Vision.

In gay men's writing, tenderness lies side by side with rage, and existential rejection of convention rubs shoulders with sexual hedonism. This groundbreaking work takes us on an unprecedented tour--in clear, lively, and non-technical language--of classic and little-known texts from the perspective of gay experience, sensibility, and desire.</p>
<p>Beginning with Wilde's and Byron's existentialist outlaw, the theme of social rebellion and the fight against conformity forms a common link among the literary works of the twentieth century. <i>Gay Men's Literature in the Twentieth Century</i> presents us with a unified analysis of these, and other, shared themes in the works of James Baldwin, Christopher Isherwood, Tennessee Williams, Lord Byron, Oscar Wilde, E. M. Forster, Jean Genet, Joe Orton, Andrew Holleran, David Leavitt, and Constantine Cavafy, and in the love poetry of the first world war.<br>
This is the most unified treatment of gay men's writing to date, written to appeal to the general reader, but based on scholarship so original that it is vital reading for anyone interested in gay studies and gender studies.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.01573 Inches, Length: 5.98424 Inches, Weight: 0.73 Pounds, Width: 0.566928 Inches",27.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/10/9780814750810.jpg,Success,78.0,16.2

While Conservatives Defend A Museum-like Humanities Curriculum, Their Opponents Argue For Opening The Canon To The Works And Lives Of Women And Minorities. This Approach, Stearns Cautions, Risks Substituting One Memorized Content For Another. Stearns Suggests An Alternative Strategy; One That Overlaps With Some Of The Radicals' Goals But Moves On To A More Ambitious Reassessment Of What The Humanities Should Convey To Students. Such A Humanities Program, Says Stearns, Should Teach Students Not Just Memorized Facts But Analytical Skills That Are Vital For A Critically Informed Citizenry.^ In Dealing With The Current Furor Over Conventional Humanistic Coverage Versus Multiculturalism, Stearns Says, I Join A Few Other Recent Observers In Offering Intermediate Positions And Certainly In Rejecting The Extremes Urged From Both Sides. But, He Adds, My Goals Are More Radical Than The Radicals' In That I Seek To Reshape The Discussion Of The Humanities By Moving Away From Debates About Which Groups It Would Privilege - Essentially A Turf Fight, However Recondite Its Phrasing - And Toward A Determination Of What Kinds Of Analyses It Should Further. I Aim For A Real Transformation Of Humanities Education In Light Of The Kinds Of Analytical Perspectives - The Habits Of The Mind - It Should Inculcate. Teaching In The Humanities Should Above All Foster A Critical Imagination - And This Point Is Not Recognized In Most Of The Current Debates. Stearns Urges The Use Of Innovative Research As The Basis Of The Humanities Curriculum, Following The Practice Of Scientific Disciplines.^ He Offers Specific Suggestions On Translating Curriculum Goals Into Courses That Can Be Taught Alongside Or Instead Of The More Conventional Staples. It Is Important, Stearns Concludes, To Use The Current Spirit Of Rancor Constructively To Build A Solid Educational Structure, One That Rests On Humanities Scholarship But Aims To Help Students Better Understand The Nature Of Human Culture And Social Behavior. 1.

Without Minimizing The Serious New Problems In American Families, Coontz Warns That A Consoling Nostalgia For A Largely Mythical Past Of Traditional Values Is A Trap That Can Only Cripple Our Capacity To Solve Today's Problems. From A Man's Home Was His Castle To Traditional Families Never Asked For A Handout, This Provocative Book Explodes Cherished Illusions About The Past. Organized Around A Series Of Myths And Half-truths That Burden Modern Families, The Book Sheds New Light On Such Contemporary Concerns As Parenting, Privacy, Love, The Division Of Labor Along Gender Lines, The Black Family, Feminism, And Sexual Practice. Fascinating Facts Abound: In The Nineteenth Century, The Age Of Sexual Consent In Some States Was Nine Or Ten, And Alcoholism And Drug Abuse Were More Rampant Than Today ... Teenage Childbearing Peaked In The Fabulous Family-oriented 1950s ... Marriages In Pioneer Days Lasted A Shorter Time Than They Do Now. Placing Current Family Dilemmas In The Context Of Far-reaching Economic, Political, And Demographic Changes, The Way We Never Were Shows That People Have Not Suddenly And Inexplicably Gone Bad And Points To Ways That We Can Help Families Do Better. Seeing Our Own Family Pains As Part Of A Larger Social Predicament Means That We Can Stop The Cycle Of Guilt Or Blame And Face The Real Issues Constructively, Coontz Writes. The Historical Evidence Reveals That Families Have Always Been In Flux And Often In Crisis, And That Families Have Been Most Successful Wherever They Have Built Meaningful Networks Beyond Their Own Boundaries.

Combining poetry, wit, polemic, and dazzling scholarship with memorial and autobiography, these essays have set new standards of passion and truthfulness for current theoretical writing.<br>&#9;The essays range from Diderot, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James to queer kids and twelve-step programs; from &quot;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl&quot; to a performance piece on Divine written with Michael Moon; from political correctness and the poetics of spanking to the experience of breast cancer in a world ravaged and reshaped by AIDS. What unites <i>Tendencies</i> is a vision of a new queer politics and thought that, however demanding and dangerous, can also be intent, inclusive, writerly, physical, and sometimes giddily fun.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A leading practitioner of gay studies, Sedgwick ( The Epistemology of the Closet ) offers an illuminating and provocative collection of essays, many reprinted from academic journals, on subjects as varied as the politics of health care, the popularization of ``queer theory'' as an academic discipline (and its harassment by PC-bashing journalists) and Sedgwick's own diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer. Sedgwick turns an unflinching eye on the dynamics of gender and identity that fail to fall into neat, heterosexual categories. She contends that the literature of James, Wilde and Cather call for a reading that is sensitive to the dissonances and ironies of a love that dare not speak its name; she interrogates the ``naturalness'' of heterosexual identity in literature and popular culture. The opening essay, for instance, invokes ``the utopian bedroom scene of Chuck Berry's immortal aubade : `Roll over, Beethoven, and tell Tchaikovsky the news.' '' Though steeped in the jargon of academic cultural studies, Sedgwick's essays offer forthright cultural analysis and an autobiographical intimacy that will prove accessible and germane for a general audience.

But the convicted spy at the center of the storm never told his side of the story...until now. When Bernard Boursicot, an innocent and charming twenty-year-old yearning for adventure and romance, was posted to the French embassy in Beijing, he met and soon fell in love with a mysterious, seductive opera singer named Shi Pei Pu. Over the course of the next eighteen years, the two lived out a passionate and dangerous liaison that produced a son, drew them into espionage, and ultimately landed them both in a French prison. The whole time, Boursicot was unaware that Pei Pu, the love of his life and his longtime sexual partner, was a man. How could this happen? How could he not know? These questions intrigued the world, making Boursicot the subject of incredulity and ridicule, and ultimately inspired an immensely popular Broadway hit, M Butterfly. But the speculation could not begin to rival the astonishing real story. To uncover the facts behind this sensational case, journalist Joyce Wadler spent three years researching court documents and psychiatrists' files, interviewing relatives, friends, and co-workers of the pair, including a former prime minister of France. Most important of all, she persuaded Boursicot, who had refused to discuss his story since his arrest, to break his silence. For the first time Ms. Wadler explains - in explicit detail - exactly how the tantalizing creature described in international headlines as ""the Chinese Mata Hari"" was able to deceive Boursicot while playing the greatest role of her...his?...life. Even richer and more compelling than the fiction it inspired, Liaison is a true story of the inseparability of love and illusion.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.23 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/34/9780553092134.jpg,Success,76.0,16.2

This Volume Offers The First Retrospective Examination Of Her Life's Work, Which Spanned Some Seventy Years, And Features Many Previously Unpublished, Remarkable Images. This Definitive Review Is Drawn Primarily From Cunningham's Archives At The Imogen Cunningham Trust, The Most Complete Collection Of Her Prints And Negatives In The World. As An Early But Undeclared Feminist, Cunningham Was One Of The First Women To Make A Successful Living As A Photographer. She Established A Professional Studio In Seattle In 1910, And During This Early Period, She Created Not Only Commercial Portraiture But A Body Of Pictorialist Imagery Often Based On Poetic And Allegorical Themes - Although Her Use Of Nude Male And Female Figures Was Considered Scandalous. After Moving To California In 1917, Cunningham Developed A Keener, More Penetrating Vision, Exemplified By Her Botanical And Nude Figure Studies Of The 1920s. Her Experiments With Multiple Imagery And Double Exposure Throughout The 1920s And 1930s Defined Her As The Most Sophisticated, Experimental, And Europe-oriented Photographer On The West Coast. Imogen Cunningham Chronicles The Photographer's Friendships With Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Alfred Stieglitz, And Dorothea Lange, As Well As Her Portrait Sessions With Leading Artists, Musicians, And Dancers. Her Stylistic Evolution Toward A Humanistic, Documentary Street Photography And The Development Of Her Signature Environmental Portraiture Are Well Illustrated By Many Compelling And Eloquent Images. More Than 120 Duotone Plates Reveal The Extraordinary And Eclectic Range Of Her Landscapes, Architectural Studies, Still Lifes, And Portraiture. By The Time Of Her Death In 1976 At The Age Of Ninety-three, Cunningham Had Become A Living Legend. Photography Had Come To Be Taken As A Serious Art Form, And Imogen Was Its Reigning Queen. The Images In This Book Form A Testament To Her Life's Work, Her Spirit, And Her Complex Vision.

It Has Since Emerged As One Of The Sturdiest Survivors Of That Era Of Religious Experimentation. The Goddess, Her Worshipers, And The Myth Of Her Reign Over Humankind's Prehistory Are Becoming Familiar Features In The American Religious Landscape, And Are Gradually Spreading Beyond There, Out Into The Cultural Mainstream. In Spite Of Its Increasing Cultural Presence, Feminist Spirituality Is Poorly Understood By Those Not Participating In Its Development Or Privy To Its Secrets.^ Why Do These Women Worship A Goddess, And Who Is She? What Do They Do When They Meet Together? What Do They Do Alone? What Attracts Them To Feminist Spirituality? Are They Part Of A Passing Cult Or Are They Creating A New Religion That Will One Day Take Its Place Alongside Judaism, Christianity, And Islam In The West? What Are Their Hopes For The World, And What Are They Doing To See Their Dreams Actualized? Living In The Lap Of The Goddess Answers These Questions And More. Drawing On Scores Of Interviews With Spiritual Feminists, Participant-observation In Feminist Spirituality's Rituals And Retreats, And A Close Reading Of The Movement's Many Texts, Sociologist Of Religion Cynthia Eller Describes This Innovative Spiritual Movement In Detail. Among The Topics Covered Are The Origins Of Feminist Spirituality; Its Use Of Ritual, Myth And Magic; And The Politics With Which Spiritual Feminists Determinedly Intertwine Their Religion.^ The Feminist Spirituality Movement Represents An Important Option For Feminists, The Critical Third Choice Available In The False Dilemma Between Reforming Patriarchal Religions And Giving Up On Religion Altogether. Living In The Lap Of The Goddess Introduces The Reader To This Important Option, And The Infinite Variety That Is The Feminist Spirituality Movement. Memorable Characters Are Met In The Pages Of This Book, And Novel Theories On Gender, Deity, Human Civilization, And The Universe Are Encountered. Throughout, The Key Question Guiding This Venture Into The Alternative Religious World Is This: Who Are These Women, And Why Are They Doing What They Do, Saying What They Say, Thinking What They Think? The Answers, Like The Participants Themselves, Are Manifold And Intriguing. 1. Feminists On Spiritual Quest -- 2. The Women Of The Feminist Spirituality Movement -- 3.

At the same time, cinema was emerging as the newest and most accessible form of popular entertainment, and as a powerful tool in propagandizing the Party line. This book looks at the interaction between these two phenomena: at the extent to which women's new status and roles were reflected and promoted on Soviet screens throughout the country's history. Part I, written by Lynne Attwood, provides an essential framework for readers unfamiliar with Soviet studies. It offers a lucid and lively account of the milestones in Soviet history, the importance of film within this history and the changing images and experiences of Soviet women within both cinema and society. In Parts II and III, women from the former Soviet Union - film critics, directors, camera-operators and script-writers - relate their own experiences in the film industry, and their responses to the images of women portrayed on screen. This crisply-written book, illustrated with evocative photographs from Soviet films, will provide readers with a real insight into the relationship between women and film in the Soviet Union.",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.95019234922 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",24.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/10/9780044405610.jpg,Success,124.0,16.2

Writer Lillian Smith (1897-1966) Devoted Her Life To Lifting The Veil Of Southern Self-deception About Race, Class, Gender, And Sexuality. Her Books, Essays, And Especially Her Letters Boldly Explored The Ways In Which The South's Attitudes And Institutions Perpetuated A Dehumanizing Experience For All Its People - White And Black, Male And Female, Rich And Poor. Smith's Best-known Books Are Strange Fruit (1944), A Bestselling Interracial Love Story That Brought Her International Acclaim; And Killer Of The Dream (1949), An Autobiographical Critique Of Southern Race Relations That Angered Many Southerners, Including Powerful Moderates. Subsequently, Smith Was Effectively Silenced As A Writer.^ An Avid Letter-writer, Smith Mastered The Epistolary Form In Her Work As Director Of Her Family's Laurel Falls Camp, An Innovative Summer Camp For Girls In The North Georgia Mountains. There She Developed Her Critique Of Southern Attitudes About Race And Gender, Her Concern For Children, And Her Theories Of Social Change. Over The Years Her Correspondents Included Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Jr., Richard Wright, And The Leaders Of Such Organizations As The Southern Conference For Human Welfare, The Naacp, And Core. Margaret Rose Gladney Has Selected 145 Of Smith's 1500 Extant Letters For This Volume.^ Arranged Chronologically And Annotated, The Letters Provide A Rich Context For Reading Smith's Published Work And Reveal Valuable Personal And Professional Information: Her Courageous Fight Against Racial Segregation; Her Fears About Remaining In Georgia, Where Her Property Was The Target Of Arson Several Times; Her Depression At Having Been Silenced As A Writer; Her Thirteen-year Battle Against Cancer; And The Full Burden Of Her Struggle As A Woman Living And Writing In The Deep South In The Five Decades Between The Two Feminist Movements Of The Twentieth Century. Gladney's Editorial Commentary Brings Into Central Focus Smith's Enduring Lesbian Relationship With Paula Snelling And Creates A Portrait Of Lillian Smith Which Recognizes And Challenges The Attitudes Toward Gender And Sexuality That Shaped And Defined Her Life, Her Choices Of Self Definition, And Her Critical Reception As A Writer.^ Gladney Argues That Smith's Triple Isolation - Political, Sexual, And Artistic - From Mainstream Southern Culture Permitted Her To See And To Expose Southern Prejudices With Unique Clarity.

In moving detail, Migael Scherer describes the external facts of her attack - she was grabbed from behind with a knife at her neck one morning in a Seattle laundromat, raped, and strangled - as well as the ordeal of reporting and testifying. Incredibly, the more compelling drama is her internal struggle to recover from these events. When Scherer is raped, her sense of time and purpose is shattered. She collapses into a confusion of images and feelings, most of them terrifying, all of them unpredictable. Years of coastal cruising with her husband of twenty years had taught her that safety at sea often depends on an accurate sense of position. Just as sailors keep a log of their voyages, she keeps a journal to help her navigate the uncharted waters. Reading over her shoulder, we journey with her through the aftermath of violence toward the slow emergence of the self. As with some books that have come from the experiences of war and illness, Still Loved by the Sun transcends the brutal facts to reveal underlying emotional truths, giving dignity back to the survivor. An inspiring story of personal triumph and recovery, it is also a story of love and the tests of love that a crisis brings. Rape leaves a wake of trauma, fear, and powerlessness - and for a very long time. By sharing her story and her gifts as a writer, Scherer helps us understand what this feels like for survivors and for those who help and comfort them.",en,,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",10.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/57/9780452270657.jpg,Success,125.0,16.2

At Such Times, The Earth Becomes Arid, Life Becomes Devoid Of Meaning, The Ground Of Culture Cracks And Splits, And Gaps Develop Among Peoples And Between People And Nature. Only Water Can Bring The Piece Back Together, Awaken Seeds Hidden In The Ground, And Enliven The Parched Tree Of Life. One Of The Most Important Ways To Call Forth The Water Of Life Is Through Story. For Years Michael Meade Has Been Steeped In Stories, Some From The Ground Of His Own Life, Others From The Ancient Rivers Of Celtic, European, And African Myth. Still Others Emerge From Years Spent As A Teacher, Listening To The Stories That Both Men And Women Carry. From These Stories He Derives Medicine For Healing Individual Wounds And Uncovers Rituals For The Remaking Of Community. Through Stories That Explore And Illuminate The Lives Of Men, Meade Examines The Wounds That Often Arise Between Father And Son And The Spells That Can Exist Between Mother And Child. These Troubles Are Investigated From Psychological And Mythological Perspectives In Order To Uncover The Layers Of Meaning Embedded In Life Experiences And To Discover The Seeds Of Healing. At The Core Of The Book Are Stories Of Initiatory Events That Mark A Man's Or A Woman's Soul Over And Pull A Person Deeper Into Life Than He Or She Would Normally Choose To Go. Seen As Tempering Through Fire And Water, These Events Decide Who A Person Is, Cause Some Power To Erupt From Inside, Or Strip Everything Away Until All That Remains Is One's Essential Self. Attuned To Our Modern Needs - The Wounds Of Divorce, Addiction, And Loss, The Moral Abandonment Of Children, The Gap Between The Genders - And Our Mythic Inheritance, Men And The Water Of Life Offers Narratives That Reflect And Resonate With The Oldest Parts Of The Human Psyche - The Place Where Things Began And The Place Where Things Can Begin Again.--jacket.

Esi, a woman living in Accra, Ghana, takes her career as a data analyst for the government seriously. An incident of marital rape, the result of her husband's anger at Esi's independence, leads to their separation. She is attracted to a married man named Ali who offers to make her his second wife. At first the arrangement appeals to Esi--she can make her work a priority--but eventually Ali's constant traveling and the way he puts off coming to see her begins to bother her. Aidoo makes use of different formats. Occasionally she provides an explanation in the form of a poetic note embedded in the text, and there are spurts of conversation in script form. In one such section Esi's mother and grandmother discuss her choice. Esi's no-nonsense grandmother says, ``Leave one man, marry another. What is the difference?''

As the editors and contributors to this startling volume point out, violence against women permeates our society at every level and in every setting. Murder. Rape. Incest. Intimidation. Pornography. Workplace harassment. Women are routinely and continuously victimized by these crimes because of the general belief, built into the very roots of our patriarchal society, that women are the proper targets of male violence. Some of the best known writers on women's issues today--MacKinnon, Dworkin, Collins, Bart, Kurz, and Fine--explore this culture of violence and oppression, examining its ideological underpinnings and its structural supports in the social, political, and legal systems that protect the violent by blaming the victim. They suggest ways in which women can understand, confront, and change this girdle of violence. Originally published as a special issue of Gender & Society, this volume will appeal to professionals and students in family studies, social work, sociology, victimology, and women's studies. Bart and Moran have done a first-rate job of editing this volume. The individual contributions are of high quality and written in an accessible style. Moreover, they are fit together in a carefully ordered sequence. . . . This is not an optimistic book, nor is reading it an uplifting experience. (Were I to say that I enjoyed it, the book would have failed in one of its stated purposes.) But Violence Against Women is bold, incisive, and important. I recommendit. --Violence UpDate The editors provide thoughtful, integrative introductions to the four parts, which themselves each contain five chapters that vary considerably in length, depth, and style, but not in their goal of explicating an important aspect of violence against women. The book, or a subset of its chapters, would make a valuable addition to undergraduate and graduate courses in many areas, including those primarily concerned with research and social policy. --Contemporary Psychology Anyone in the helping professions would benefit from this practical guide to what has, and has not, been examined in the study of violence against women. --Readings </i></b></strong></em></li></ul></p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9259415004 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches",68.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/50/9780803950450.jpg,Success,102.0,16.2

Gay Cops Is A Ground-breaking Study Of The Lives Of Gay And Lesbian Police Officers In America. Through Revealing Interviews, Leinen Explores The Dilemmas Facing Homosexual Police Officers As They Balance The Day-to-day Realities Of Their Work And Sexual Identities. Leinen Helps The Reader To Hear Their Voices - Sometimes Emotional And Poignant, Often Defiant Or Humorous, And Always Engaging. Though Official Police Policy May Be To Recruit Homosexuals, Most Police Officers Resent The Presence Of Their Gay And Lesbian Colleagues And Discriminate Against Them. Attitudes Range From Uneducated Dislike To Fear Of Contracting Aids From A Bleeding Partner. The Contempt For Homosexuals Traditionally Expressed By Police Often Intensifies A Homosexual Cop's Sense Of Inferiority And Social Exclusion. For Gay Cops, The Issue Is Whether Or Not To Come Out At Work And To Which People. Living A Life Of Secrecy And Lies At Work; Wearing A Wedding Ring As A Disidentifier; And Engaging In Sexist Talk To Fool Others Can Wreak Havoc On A Gay Cop's Self-confidence And Personal Life. Yet Coming Out At Work Can Be A Terrifying Prospect. Most Start Small, Telling Only Their Partners. Some Partners, Like Some Parents, Reject Them, But Many Are Accepting. Leinen Finds That Most Police Officers Care More About Whether Their Partner Is A Good Cop Than About His Or Her Sexual Preference.

Against this perilous backdrop, a passionate, dangerous love develops between Marrah, a brave and gifted priestess, and Stavan, one of the warriors sent to invade her peace-loving land. Brilliantly capturing the lives of those women and men caught in this life-shattering crossfire, Mackey traces the young Marrah's treacherous path across Europe, from the shores of Brittany and the cave paintings of western France to the temples of Sardinia and the Steppes of the East. Though Marrah finds barbarism, the brutalization of women, and environmental destruction, her stunning journey also reveals the human capacity for love, compassion, and enduring faith.

A woman of enormous courage, both in life-threatening situations and her challenging of women's traditional roles, Tina Modotti's life became the stuff of myth and legend. Based on years of painstaking research in Mexico, Europe and the United States, Tina Modotti - Photographer and Revolutionary includes a wealth of new material and is a major step toward demythologizing the life of one of the most fascinating women of an extraordinary era. In 1913 Tina Modotti left her native Italy for San Francisco, becoming a star of the local Italian theatre before marrying the romantic poet-painter Roubaix de l'Abrie Richey. By 1920, she had embarked on a Hollywood film career and immersed herself in bohemian Los Angeles, beginning an intense relationship with the respected American photographer, Edward Weston. On a trip to Mexico in 1922 to bury her husband, she met the Mexican muralists and became enthralled with the burgeoning cultural renaissance there. Increasingly dissatisfied with the film world, she persuaded Weston to teach her photography and move with her to Mexico. Her Mexico City homes became renowned gathering places for artists, writers and radicals, where Diego Rivera courted Frida Kahlo and Latin American exiles plotted revolution. Turning her camera to record Mexico in its most vibrant years, her photographs achieve a striking synthesis of artistic form and social content. Her contact with Mexico's muralists, including a brief affair with Rivera, led to her involvement in radical politics. In 1929, she was framed for the murder of her Cuban lover, gunned down at her side on a Mexico City street.

The Women's Movement Has Come A Long Way In The Last Hundred Years, But So Too Have Our Knowledge And Appreciation Of Religions Other Than Judaism And Christianity. Serinity Young's Anthology Of Sacred Texts By And About Women Is The First Comprehensive Comparative Sourcebook On Women And Religion. It Makes Available Readings By And About Women From The Primary Texts Of The World's Religions. The Religions Treated Include Not Only The Big Seven, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, And Taoism, But The Religions Of Northern Europe, The Ancient Near East, Greece, And Rome, Shamanism And Tribal Religions, As Well As More Recent Alternative Religious Movements. Each Chapter Begins With A Brief Introduction To The Religion In Question, Providing A Historical Overview With Particular Regard To Women. Then Follow Representative Texts About Women (each With Its Own Introduction) From Works That Are Central To Their Respective Traditions. These Texts Include Creation Stories, Biographies Of Founders (in Which Women Often Play A Prominent Role), Law Codes, Folklore And Fairy Tales, The Texts Of Tribal Peoples, And Works Explicitly By Women. Folklore And Fairy Tales Have Particular Importance In This Book Because They Generally Reveal The Beliefs Of The Little Tradition, Which Are Often In The Hands Of Women, While The Great Tradition Is Represented By The Male-dominated Forms Of Orthodoxy. The Works By Women Here Take Many Forms From Theological Treatises To Mystical Poems To Poems Mourning The Loss Of A Child Or Husband To The Matter-of-fact Statements By Tribal Women, Such As Nisa, Expressing The Uncertainties Of Any Religious Knowing. Many Of The Texts Included In This Anthology Are Not Only Representative Texts About Women But Formative Texts Of The Various Traditions, Texts That Have Seeped Into The Language And Consciousness Of Their Culture And Shaped Its View Of Women. In Her Introduction The Author Sketches Certain Themes That Are Of Central Importance For The Cross-cultural Or Comparative Study Of Women In World Religion: Representations Of Women As Evil, Women As Role Models, Wisdom As Feminine, Women Religiosi, Dualities, Goddesses, Sex Changes And Sex Disguises, Myths And Stories Of Gender Conflict. These Themes Can Help Guide The Reader As She Makes Her Way Through Virtual Libraries Of The World's Sacred Texts. Reading Sacred Texts In This Way, From The Perspective Of Women, Can Be A Radical Activity, An Activity That, At Its Best, Subverts Male Dominance Of The Text.--jacket.
