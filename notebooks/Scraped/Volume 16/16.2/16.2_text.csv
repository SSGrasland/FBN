Triad Moon
by Gillean Chase
Meet Lila, Brook and Helen, three women whose bonds of
love, and sexuality take them beyond conventional
relationships. Incest and survival, healing and the strength
of the heart: these themes are explored in a novel that is at
once an unusual coming-out story and a passionate
affirmation of mature love.
October, 1993 ISBN 0-921881-28-2 $9.95
Without Wings
by Jackie Manthorne
In this new collection of interwoven stories, the author of
Fascination and Other Bar Stories, moves her characters out of the
bar and into life. There, they cope with issues that unite
and divide lesbians in a big city. With wry humour,
Manthorne creates an eminently readable tale of lesbian life
today.
October, 1993 ISBN 0-921881-29-0 $9.95
Without Wings
Jackie Manthorne Woman in the Rock
by Claudia Gahlinger
Here is a haunting, lyrical collection of stories about
forgetting and remembering incest. Gahlinger’s characters
are consoled by living near the sea and finding strong
friends. Above all, they find consolation in fishing, an act
that allows for the eventual, triumphant emergence of the
“woman in the rock.”

Craig Rodwell the founder of the Oscar Wilde
Memorial Book Store in NYC died on June 18 shortly
after ABA, of stomach cancer. He was 52 years old.
Oscar Wilde was the first gay and lesbian book-
store in the U.S., and possibly in the world. Craig
opened the store in 1967, two years before
Stonewall and was committed to sharing resources
and space equally between books for lesbians and
gay men. The idea of a bookstore that offered non-
pornographic images of gay men and lesbians was
unheard of when Craig opened the store and he
refused to stock skin magazines of pornographic-
based literature of any kind.
Craig and Harvey Milk were lovers during
Harvey’s east coast years. He had also been a mem-
ber of the Mattachine Society, was present at
Stonewall and is credited with originating the first
Gay Pride march. We will miss his vision and his
many contributions to our communities. O

of “big-name” feminist mainstream- published
authors this year. Post year-of-the-woman we seem
to be being “rediscovered” (read that as “ignored

Environmental Crisis. Joni also wrote a wonderful

Aunt Lute Books
As a woman of color, an African American work-
ing within the women’s world of letters, I occupy a
peculiar space in relation to the old, whitegirl school
of Feminism (capital F, as in Seneca Falls). Despite
the ecstasy of multicultural women’s politics, the
heart of the F word —in terms of power distribution
and things like that —is still white, monologic. There
are sites where women are attempting to reinscribe
the term and its movements, but these sites of coali-
tion are rocky places to be. A woman can get caught
between what one can see as possibility and what
one faces as reality. As Coco Fusco says, “We cannot
confuse the appearance of access created by the com-
modification of ethnicity...with the decentralization
of wealth...that has yet to take place in this country.”
However disillusioned I may feel by the term in
its applications, feminism or certain feminisms
awoke me to conciousness, awoke me to a sense of
self as useful agent and helped me to put words to

The Pink Sheets & the FTC
ABA did commission its lawyer to create ABA
Guidelines for Antitrust Compliance which, pub-
lished on pink paper, became known as The Pink
Sheet. The Pink Sheet, although perhaps not intend-
ed to inhibit discussion, was quoted and used to
stop almost every reference to price and discount or
to limit other legitimate bookseller discussion in
almost every ABA event I attended.
The Pink Sheet (which seems to have been
developed and circulated at the behest of the ABA
administration, rather than at the request of the
Board) states that “ABA members should not even

The ABA Membership Meeting
“Two motions and a hall full of angry booksellers.”
This was another tense, exciting, hair-raising
Membership Meeting. Following the lawyer's inter-
pretation of the FTC's interest in the conversations
of independent booksellers and their associations,
Elaine Petrocelli jump-started the meeting by
proposing that the agenda be restructured to allow
for immediate discussion of the lawyer’s presenta-
tions and other issues of (burning) importance to
the members. The assembled membership, needless
to say, supported this proposal with great enthusi-
asm.
Twenty-some booksellers spoke passionately on
the issue of the survival of independent bookstores.
Most were critical of ABA (the organization) and
some of the Board for taking little initiative and too
little action on the issues that address survival.
Booksellers were angry about the situation and
many were also angry about ABA’s lack of atten-
tion to the needs and survival issues of the majority
of its bookstore members.

When most FBN readers hear the words “Press
Gang,” they immediately think, quite rightly, of the
Vancouver-based feminist publisher. But in Vancouver
“Press Gang” also means the rowdy, vibrant, history-
making, barrier-bashing Press Gang Printers. Press
Gang Printers and Press Gang Publishers started out as
a radical print shop 22 years ago and became a women’s
press during the era when feminists and lesbians were
working to gain control of all aspects of the publishing
and printing process. In this era when mainstream print-
ers are once again refusing to print lesbian, feminist, and
gay books, FBN is very pleased to offer you a history of a
press that has fought it’s way into the 90's.
By Lynn Giraud and Sheila Gilhooly
Press Gang Printers is the only surviving
women’s print shop in North America. Throughout
the 1970s, many such collectively operated feminist
printshops sprang up, shaped by the vital political
climate of the women’s liberation movement and
the new left. By the mid-1980s, there was even an
organization called the Alliance of Lesbian and
Feminist Printers. Sadly, the 1980s also saw the Storefront Press in Seattle, Up Press in Palo Alto,
demise of the San Francisco Women’s Press, and Iowa City Women’s Press. Press Gang Printers

THE ADVENTURES OF STOUT MAMA
Sibyl James
A collection of short essays about Stout Mama, an eclectic feminist in her forties
and a ‘bewildered techno-peasant.’”’ Engaging and droll, Stout Mama is more
interested in honesty and good times than in consumerism in the modern age. A
traveler, a dreamer, a bird watcher, and a music lover, Stout Mama is a bohemian
spirit who has never owned a television. 0-918949-34-3 Hardcover $14

Patti Tana (Available: August 1993)
A collection of poems and stories that have a spirit and energy that carry you
along with them. With oceans and rivers running throughout, this collection is in tune
with the natural order of things, creating a peaceful, accepting feeling. From a child
sledding in the snow or skimming stones on the river, to an adult dancing by the ocean
in the moonlight, Tana relates the power of water as an element in our lives.
Complementing these pieces are the serene endless line drawings of Alfred Van
Loen, flowing like the waters of life Tana shares with us.

WHY FLOWERS BLOOM
Janet Carncross Chandler (Available: November 1993)
A collection of poems sharing the many joys, frustrations, and sorrows of the long
and full life of a woman now in her eighties. Chandler speaks personally of her
childhood, the love of a husband no longer living, and her children (twins!) and
grandchildren that are all part of her story. Writing is a wonderful tool that Chandler
takes full advantage of as she faces daily and lifelong milestones: moving into a
retirement home, starting a writer's workshop for women, and turning eighty. There
is never a dull moment in this lively story of a still young older woman - older, but
never old. 0-918949-37-8 Paper $8; -38-6 Cloth $12
