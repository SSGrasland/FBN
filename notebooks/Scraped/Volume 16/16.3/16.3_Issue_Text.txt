Trees Call for What They Need is a beautiful new novel with a warm
regional flavor by Melissa Kwasny. It’s the story of three women born at the turn
of the century and their lives in Town of Pines: Nettie, a woolen mill worker and
tenant farmer; Aunt Till, a Spiritualist medium and lesbian; and Marie, a Polish
immigrant who owns the Poletown bar. Narrated in Nettie’s inimitable voice, this
novel explores family and belonging, farming and caring for the land, the roots
you put down and leave behind. It’s the story of one woman’s life that leaves
echoes of her wisdom trembling in your memory. 0-933216-96-3 $9.95
The Other Side of Silence introduces sleuth Tyler Jones, newspaper colum-
nist and feminist lesbian activist. Each morning, Tyler walks her dog in the
park—a quiet, uneventful amble until the morning the dog, appropriately named
Agatha Christie, discovers a body. Tyler assumes she’s an innocent bystander
until she’s informed that the victim was a man who once threatened her life. Now
the San Francisco Police Department thinks she’s a prime suspect. Tyler enlists
the aid of a good friend, her newspaper contacts, and her own investigating abili-
ties to solve the murder. But soon she finds herself facing a possible moral
dilemma: will she reveal the killer that she feels might have been justified? In the
end, Tyler alone faces “that roar which is the other side of silence.”

“Unflinching, insightful, beautifully written, Mary Saracino’s No Matter What
is a terrible fable told from the child’s perspective. ‘God is busy tonight,’ Peanut
tells us near the end of the novel. But the truth is, in [her] world...God is always
busy, and Peanut’s love for her mother has become a steel trap closed tight
around her. No Matter What reminds me of Kathryn Harrison’s marvelous
Thicker Than Water (Random House). Mary Saracino has the same sure grasp of
a child’s willingness to give over everything she is to save her mother, and the
slow remorseless way that love can turn like a blade in the soul of a child.”

Celebrating Resistance
Out Rage: Lesbian Stories and Poems 7 e
Edited by Mona Oikawa, Dionne Falconer, Rosamund Elwin and Ann Decter
Homophobia, lesbophobia, heterosexism — words for hatred that permeates contemporary
society. Hatred lesbians encounter on a daily basis, intruding on our loves and our joys,
portraying us as isolated oddities while a hostile world parades itself as healthy. Out Rage is a
meeting point of resistance, a coming together out of strength, shouting our courage,
whispering our sorrows, holding a mirror to the hatred we face and throwing it back on its
perpetrators.
From the classics of Pat Parker to new work by emerging writers, this collection embodies the
essential lesbian tradition of resistance.

Nice Rodriguez

pleasure in life, even at their most poignant moments. In Throw It To The River, Nice
Rodriguez shines a bright lesbian light on a fascinating world.

THE RADICAL FUTURE OF LIBERAL FEMINISM
Zillah R. Eisenstein
With a new preface and postscript by the author
“In her . . . demanding and invigorating book, Eisenstein shows that liberal feminism is
‘self-contradictory’ because it ‘accepts liberalism and at the same time rejects its
patriarchal base’. ..…. Tihis br—illiant , logLicali, binfrlamamartoryy w or k J is eosseuntiarl.”nal
“Eisenstein advances the view that liberal feminism contains within itself the seeds of
radical change. As women move in increasing numbers into the public sphere of paid
work, they demand equality to which liberalism must, however reluctantly, admit that
they are entitled. And as they do so, they inevitably recognize the ‘contradiction’ between
their public lives and their private subordination.” — Signs

Over a thousand books with a combined weight of
1,043 pounds, valued at an estimated $8,200 were
held for three to four weeks while every book in the Canada
shipments was examined. Customs

herself; the mother—nurturing woman in the fullness of her life; and
the crone—the wise, old healing woman. In this engaging narrative,
Wilshire skillfully weaves history and poetic myth into a rich tapestry
of traditions that honor the sacred Female in all women, and she

Ingram manages its inventory and selects and buys
90+% of its inventory, filed suit against the Bantam
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group (BDD) on
August 26. The suit charges BDD with violating the
Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman
Act, and was filed in the U.S. District Court in
Nashville.
The suit alleges that BDD places Ingram and
booksellers who order from Ingram at a competi-
tive disadvantage by arbitrarily dividing retailers
who sell books into two categories, “bookstores”
and “mass merchandisers,” and that “bookstores”
who order through distributors receive fewer
advertising money from BDD. It also alleges that
distributors which sell to “bookstores” receive less
compensation for the services they provide.
Key allegations of the suit include:
“Sloan challenges • Compensation of distributors. Distributors
U.S. Foreign Policy, who sell to retailers classified by BDD as “book-
t hh oe m oP pa hle os bt ii an i a an n- dI s r aa e l hi o sc to n of fl ic ot t, her issues throughout an amazingly stores” receive a significantly lower level of compen-

• Cooperative Advertising Funds. “Bookstores”
who purchase BDD titles both directly from BDD
and via distributors are disqualified from receiving
cooperative advertising allowances from BDD on
purchases made via distributors.
° Direct Purchase from BDD. Many “book-
stores” are unable to purchase mass market titles
directly because of BDD’s impediments to purchas-
ing directly, such as minimum purchase require-
ments and because BDD does not offer next-day or
“just-in-time” delivery of BDD titles for most orders.

Learning to Sit in the Silence
A Journal of Caretaking
Elaine Marcus Starkman
How do we handle the stress of providing for our elderly parents?
Do we make sacrifices and keep our family members at home with us?
Or do we place the aged in convalescent homes, possibly suffering
guilt pangs as emotionally wearing as the stressors of living with
them? Based on Ms. Starkman's experiences caring for her aging
mother-in-law, this fictional version reveals in diary form the day-to-
day joys and challenges of caring for an elderly parent.

Time Management
ÎDEAS FROM
By Dawn L. Martin to herself in this way, understanding that her work
is important, but it wil! get done.
It’s Thursday morning, the first of two Feminist
Bookstore Days at this year’s ABA. The Miami sun
had been up for a few hours already and the
humidity was beginning to set in. A room of about
50 feminist booksellers sat steadfastly around a
makeshift circle ready (despite the ensuing heat) to
get down to business. The first topic on the agenda
was time management. Most booksellers feel that
there aren't enough hours in a day to do all the
things it takes to manage an effective store. One
proposal was more like advice to live by, and was
put to the group by Sue Butterworth of Silver
Moon Bookshop (U.K.): “Remember that urgent
things are not necessarily the most important.”
Certainly, if one can remember that, our harried
work environments take on less significance. The
following is a list of suggestions generated during
an intense and productive brainstorming session.

women as the (Bengali) century ended and the new
year, 1400, began. The theme of our programme was
“Sangrame Nirmane Banglar Narir Ekshaw
Bochar.” In English that means “Living Through
Our Struggles and Reconstructing New. Realities:
One Hundred Years of Bengali Women.”
The events ran for a week, 13 April to 20 April,
1993. It was an excellent opportunity to ground the
present women’s struggle of Bangladesh within the
longer overview of history to bring into relief the
elements of its continuity as well as discontinuity. It
was also an opportunity to address developmental
issues in the context of the women of Bangladesh.
The programme included publications of diaries,
printing posters and calendars, discussions, cultural
performances and an exhibition.
On the inaugural day, guests, women and men
alike, who had contributions in our life were greeted
with flowers and songs by young children. About 70
women from different walks of life and from differ-
ent parts of the country took part in the discussion
meeting. They were mostly from the older genera-
tion. Some were close to 100. They talked about their
lives, the hurdles they had to cross and, finally, their
contribution toward the emancipation of women
over the century. Naragrantha Prabartana

What is wrong with this picture? Where are our
books? Why are we letting Anglo writers use us as

selves? Part of the problem is that when women
begin to write, they are more likely to write a poem
or maybe a short story, and publishers are general-

books by Latina lesbians is increasing, very few are
published every year, and it does not appear that

A Ship In The Harbor
Meg Blake's life is at a crossroads: her 17-year marriage is
no longer tenable since she’s come out as a lesbian, her
work within the Catholic Church has lost its meaning, and
her first relationship with a woman has come to an end. In
an effort to gain control over her life, she leaves her family
and moves to the Oregon coast, where she meets Jody
at a women’s gathering. MARY HERON |
Jody and her lover, Susan, are involved in a suspicious car
accident in which Susan drowns. The police immediately
suspect Jody, but Meg knows they're wrong and searches
for the facts. At the same time, Meg is discovering how to
live on her own, how to fight for herself and what she
believes in, and how to release the past and love again.
New author, Mary Heron Dyer, unfolds this
romance/mystery in Oregon and captures that area's recent
climate of increasing homophobia and anti-choice fervor.
