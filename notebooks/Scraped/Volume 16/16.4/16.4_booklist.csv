Efronia Was Born In 1894 To A Christian Armenian Family Living In The Ottoman Empire. Though Her Father Was Brutally Murdered When She Was An Infant, His Death Was Only A Foreshadowing Of The Greater Tragedies That Would Befall The Armenian Community And Dramatically Alter The Young Girl's Life. Efronia Grew Into A Beautiful Young Woman And Was Pursued By Many Elegible Suitors. Despite Her Desires For Stability And Freedom From Her Irresponsible Brother, She Spurned Them All. But Ramzi Was Different; She Fell In Love With Him When They First Met. However, Their Passionate Feelings For Each Other Could Not Surmount The Cultural, Political, And Religious Obstacles To Their Marriage, For He Was A Persian Moslem, She An Armenian Christian. Even If There Was Some Hope That Her Family Would Eventually Consent To The Union, That Hope Was Destroyed After The Eruption Of World War I And The Massacre And Deportation Of Armenians Living Within The Ottoman Empire. For Half A Century, Efronia Told No One Of Her Secret Love For Ramzi. Only When She Was In Her Late Eighties, Living In Northern California With Her Son And His Wife, Did She Write Her Memoirs, Finally Revealing The One Love Of Her Youth, Which Never Diminished Throughout Her Lifetime. After His Mother's Death, Herant Katchadourian Translated Her Tragic Account, Discovering Much That Was New Even To Him. Stina Katchadourian Has Woven Into The Work Her Memories Of Her Mother-in-law And Provided The Historical Backdrop That Is Frighteningly Familiar In This Age Of Final Solutions And Ethnic Cleansing. The Result Is An Unforgettably Poignant And Moving Narrative. Told With Great Warmth, This Gripping Account Of A Strong And Spirited Woman Evokes A Place And Time That, Though Destroyed Forever, Will Never Be Forgotten By Armenians In Exile Throughout The World.

In this unique document, Mary Prince vividly recalls her life as a slave in Bermuda, Turks Island, and Antigua, her rebellion against physical and psychological degradation, and her eventual escape to London in 1828.<br>
First published in London and Edinburgh in 1831, and well into its third edition that year, <i>The History of Mary Prince</i> inflamed public opinion and created political havoc. Never before had the sufferings and indignities of enslavement been seen through the eyes of a woman--a woman struggling for freedom in the face of great odds.<br>
Moira Ferguson's edition of the book added an introduction, annotations, and appendices. The book has found popularity both in the classroom and with the general public. Recently, an adaptation of the memoirs of Mary Prince appeared as one segment of ""A Skirt Through History,"" a six-part feature film series produced by the BBC. Mary Prince's story has also been the centerpiece of BBC radio broadcasts.<br>
In this revised and expanded edition of <i>The History of Mary Prince,</i> Ferguson has added new material, based on her extensive research in Bermuda and London. The book includes new details of Mary Prince's experiences as a freewoman in England, the transcripts of several libel cases brought against her, and the reactions of British society, as seen in prominent periodicals of the day, against the original publication of <i>The History of Mary Prince.</i> This new material brings greater depth and detail and serves to more fully illustrate and contextualize the life of this remarkable woman.<br>
Moira Ferguson is James E.Ryan Professor of English and Women's Literature, University of Nebraska.<br>


                        <p>""Interesting and highly valuable first-person narrative of a woman slave who details her experiences in Bermuda and Antigua and also in Britain where she was employed by abolitionist Thomas Pringle. Sheds light on women's roles and experiences, and on slave system in islands. Prince was first known woman who rebelled from slavery and wrote her own account. First published in 1831, work was eagerly embraced by antislavery groups""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.

0-7006-0605-X,Good Sex: Perspectives on Sexual Ethics,"Belliotti, Raymond A.",University Press of Kansas,328.0,1993-10-04,"Philosophy, Ethics & Moral Philosophy",Paperback,"<p>Rules about sexuality, written and unwritten, have existed in every culture as have disagreements over what is and isn't acceptable. Must morally permissible sex have only one function? Must it be heterosexual? Must it occur within the confines of the institution of marriage? Must it be accompanied by requisite emotions such as love and intimacy?<p>Addressing questions of sexuality that philosophers have pondered for centuries, Raymond Belliotti covers a myriad of issues, including the origin of gender and reproductive roles , the function of morally permissible sex, heterosexuality and homosexuality, mutual consent, and extramarital sex. Looking at sexual morality in both a historical and a contemporary context, he provides a critical survey of various philosophies, from ancient Greek dualism to feminism, and distinguishes morally permissible sex from morally ideal sex, maximally fulfilling sex, and prudentially sound sex.<p> In addition, Belliotti advances and defends a new and provocative five-tier framework for sexual ethics. This framework requires examination of the presence of libertarian agreement; a contextual attentiveness to general moral precepts; an analysis of economic and sexual exploitation; consideration of third party effects; and an understanding of the effects of sexual activity on wider social contexts. By applying it to heterosexuality, homosexuality, bestiality, necrophilia, incest, and prostitution, Belliotti connects sexual ethics to sociopolitical theory and certain core philosophical concerns. In addition, he develops a new theory of sexual ethics that aspires to mediate the tensions between mainstream Western moralities and their leftist and feminist critics.<p> Sexual activity is unquestionably one of the most powerfully animating human drives. By examining the ethics of sexuality, Belliotti reveals much about the people we are and the people we might become.<p></p>",en,New ed.,"Height: 8.97 Inches, Length: 5.96 Inches, Weight: 1.51898498518 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/54/9780700606054.jpg,Success,67.0,16.4

Fleeing her abusive ex-spouse, a physician she dubs ``The Jerk,'' Goldy and her teenage son Arch find a snug third-floor refuge in the Aspen Meadow, Colo., mansion of quirky Gen. Bo Farquhar, a retired munitions and terrorist pro who breezily detonates bombs while gardening and bird-watching. As the general's live-in gourmet cook, Goldly still has time to run Goldilocks' Catering and juggle two suitors--attractive psychiatrist Philip Miller and comfortably chubby cop Tom Schultz. Philip's shocking death--he careens off a cliff in a BMW after munching her brunch--casts suspicion on Goldy. Which of her foes might want to frame her? And who is the critic writing vicious reviews of her cooking in the Mountain Journal ? The plot spins along in good-humored fashion, while Goldy continues to whip up goodies for events like a disastrous ``aphrodisiac dinner'' for eight and a barbecue at which her luscious dessert smashes on the floor. When Arch vanishes, Goldly panics, but the author makes sure that all enigmas wind up in solutions that will surprise and please.

In these interviews, conducted both separately and jointly, they discuss how their writing moves from conception to completion and how The Beet Queen, Tracks, A Yellow Raft in Blue Water, and The Crown of Columbus have been enhanced by both their artistic and their matrimonial union. Being of mixed blood and having lived in both white and Indian worlds, they give an original perspective on American society. Sometimes with humor and always with refreshing candor, their discussions undermine the damaging stereotypes of American Indians. Some of the interviews focus on their nonfiction book The Broken Cord, which recounts the struggle to solve their adopted son's health problems from fetal alcohol syndrome. Included also are two recent interviews published here for the first time. In this collection Erdrich and Dorris tell why they have chosen to write about many varying subjects and why they refuse to be imprisoned in a literary ghetto of writers whose only subjects are Native Americans.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Width: 1 Inches",39.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/14/9780878056514.jpg,Success,67.0,16.4

This Volume Offers The First Retrospective Examination Of Her Life's Work, Which Spanned Some Seventy Years, And Features Many Previously Unpublished, Remarkable Images. This Definitive Review Is Drawn Primarily From Cunningham's Archives At The Imogen Cunningham Trust, The Most Complete Collection Of Her Prints And Negatives In The World. As An Early But Undeclared Feminist, Cunningham Was One Of The First Women To Make A Successful Living As A Photographer. She Established A Professional Studio In Seattle In 1910, And During This Early Period, She Created Not Only Commercial Portraiture But A Body Of Pictorialist Imagery Often Based On Poetic And Allegorical Themes - Although Her Use Of Nude Male And Female Figures Was Considered Scandalous. After Moving To California In 1917, Cunningham Developed A Keener, More Penetrating Vision, Exemplified By Her Botanical And Nude Figure Studies Of The 1920s. Her Experiments With Multiple Imagery And Double Exposure Throughout The 1920s And 1930s Defined Her As The Most Sophisticated, Experimental, And Europe-oriented Photographer On The West Coast. Imogen Cunningham Chronicles The Photographer's Friendships With Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Alfred Stieglitz, And Dorothea Lange, As Well As Her Portrait Sessions With Leading Artists, Musicians, And Dancers. Her Stylistic Evolution Toward A Humanistic, Documentary Street Photography And The Development Of Her Signature Environmental Portraiture Are Well Illustrated By Many Compelling And Eloquent Images. More Than 120 Duotone Plates Reveal The Extraordinary And Eclectic Range Of Her Landscapes, Architectural Studies, Still Lifes, And Portraiture. By The Time Of Her Death In 1976 At The Age Of Ninety-three, Cunningham Had Become A Living Legend. Photography Had Come To Be Taken As A Serious Art Form, And Imogen Was Its Reigning Queen. The Images In This Book Form A Testament To Her Life's Work, Her Spirit, And Her Complex Vision.

Eliot when he complained that Hitler made an intelligent anti-semitism impossible for a generation? In her new book, Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Women, novelist and critic, Andrea Freud Loewenstein examines the persistent anti-semitic tendencies in modernist, British intellectual culture. Pursuing her subject with literary, historical, and psychological analyses, Loewenstein argues that this anti-semitism must be understood in terms of its metaphorical link with misogyny.</p><p>Situated in the context of the history of Jews in Britain, Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Women begins by questioning the widespread belief that the British government was a friend to the Jews in the 30s and 40s. Loewenstein shows that, as evident in the hypocrisy of many British governmental policies prior to and during WWII, Britain actively collaborated in the Jews' destruction. Against the backdrop of this tragic complicity in the Holocaust, Loewenstein evaluates Jewish stereotypes in the works of three representative twentieth-century British thinkers and writers. Her analysis provides a revealing critique of British modernism.</p><p>In a larger sense, Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Womenexplores the riddle of prejudice. Loewenstein argues that anti-semitism is nurtured in an environment populated by other hatreds --misogyny, homophobia, and racism. To explain the interaction of these prejudices, she develops an investigative model grounded in object relations theory and informed by the works of suchtheoretically diverse authors as Virginia Woolf, Kate Millett, and Alice Miller. Loewenstein lucidly argues within an autobiographical framework, insisting on the need for critics to . . . look within ourselves for 'that terrible other' rather than to complacently assume that we ourselves exist outside the ideology of power.</p><p>This well-written and readable book will be of interest to many people, ranging students of British history to psychoanalysts, from historians of Jewish culture to anyone interested in feminist and literary theory.</p><br></p><h3>Booknews</h3><p>An examination of the figures of Jew and woman in the works of three British male authors written between 1929 and 1945. Basing her interpretations on biographical information and on the close analysis of a large body of fiction by each author, Loewenstein reconstructs the psychological system through which each one envisions the world, showing how Jews and women function in the texts, and in each individual psychopathology, as a representation of the Other.

Although prey to night terrors, she is adept at smoothing the disorder of reality into controlled prose. Interweaving memory, conversation, and reflection, <i>Walking Naked</i> telescopes the whole of Laura's life-childhood, marriages, triumphs, and disappointments-into a day in which the past and the present converge. It begins with a game of tennis played for duty rather than amusement and progresses, via an afternoon party of old friends and jaded emotions, to a bewildering visit to Laura's son, who is imprisoned on a drugs charge. At its close, the possibility of death within the family brings unresolved conflicts to center stage, and Laura strips herself of the posturing and self-deceit with which she has cloaked her vulnerability.

The films they saw, including <em>The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity. Laura, Murder, My Sweet</em>, and <em>The Woman in the Window</em>, prompted the naming and theorization of a new phenomenon: <em>film noir</em>.
<p>Much of what has been written about the genre since has remained within the orbit of this preliminary assessment. While sympathetic towards the early French critics, this collection of original essays attempts to move beyond their first fascinated look. Beginning with an autonomy of that look—of the '<em>poujadist</em>' climate that nourished it and the imminent collapse of the Hollywood studio system that gave it its mournful inflection—<em>Shades of Noir</em> re-explores and calls into question the object first constructed by it. The impetus for this shift in perspective comes from the films themselves, viewed in the light of contemporary social and political concerns, and from new theoretical insights.</p>
<p>Several contributions analyze the re-emergence of noir in recent years, most notably in the hybrid forms produced in the 1980s by the merging of noir with science fiction and horror, for example <em>Blade Runner</em> and <em>Angel Heart</em>, and in films by black directors such as <em>Deep Cover, Straight out of Brooklyn, A Rage in Harlem</em> and <em>One False Move</em>. Other essays focus on the open urban territory in which the noir hero hides out; the office spaces in <em>Chandler</em>, and the palpable sense of waiting that fills empty warehouses, corridors and hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Shades of Noir</em> pays renewed attention to the lethal relation between the sexes; to the femme fatale and the other women in noir. As the role of women expands, the femme fatale remains deadly, but her deadliness takes on new meanings.</p>

It Offers A Revolutionary And Convincing Reading Of Welty's The Golden Apples (1949), But Its Implications For The Study Of Welty As A Writer Go Far Beyond Its Interpretation Of This Single Text. Until The Recent Explosion Of Feminist Critical Interest In Her Work, Welty Criticism Was Dominated By The Narrow And Singular Perspective Of Her As A White Southern Lady Writing First-rate Regional Fiction. Today Her Work Is Being Closely Re-examined For Its Innovations And Artistry. In This Revolutionary New Way Of Studying Welty, Rebecca Mark And Other Contemporary Critics Have Focused Not Upon Welty's Southernness But Upon Her Total Engagement With Literary Modernism. Rebecca Mark's Study Proposes Feminist Intertextuality As A Reading Strategy For A Critical Study Of Welty.^ Here Mark Directly Attacks The Problem Of Literary Influence Which For Decades Has Intrigued Critics Of The Golden Apples. Many Have Focused On Its Mythical Dimensions. Instead, Mark Finds Allusions That Are Far More Pervasive. These She Sees To Be A Direct Challenge To The Dominant Cultural Voices Of Literary Tradition. She Argues That Welty's Text Refutes The Apocalypse And Despair That Are Hallmarks Formulated By Joyce And By Faulkner. She Shows Indeed That Welty's Text Confronts One Of The Mainstays Of Western Literary Tradition - The Indomitable Hero. She Argues That The Expansive Intertextuality In Welty Reveals A Communal, Resonant, Metaphoric Narrative That Transforms Such Masculine Elements As Rape, Domination, And Victimization Of The Feminine Into Narratives Of Engagement, Battle, Confrontation, Fertility, And Sexual Exchange Between The Masculine And The Feminine.^ Mark's Reading Shows How Welty Has Responded Not Just To Literary Texts But Also To Cultural Forces In Creating Her Memorable Stories. Because Welty Has Given Voice To A Range Of Silenced People - African Americans, Women, Old People, And Children - Mark Says Rightly That Welty's Gift Lies In The Extraordinary Melding Of Her Diverse Knowledge Of Literature, History, And Immediate Locale. 1.

The findings from twenty years of research by two of America's most distinguished social scientists show that gender bias in our schools makes it impossible for girls to receive an education equal to boys'. Girls are systematically denied opportunities in areas where boys are encouraged to excel, often by well-meaning teachers who are unaware that they are transmitting sexist values. Girls are taught to speak quietly, to defer to boys, to avoid math and science, and to value neatness over innovation, appearance over intelligence. In the early grades girls, brimming with intelligence and potential, routinely outperform boys on achievement tests, but by the time they graduate from high school they lag far behind boys - a process of degeneration that continues into adulthood. By the time girls enter the working world, the damage has been done. Our daughters, tomorrow's women, learn that to be female is to be passive and deferential: We have, effectively, made girls second-class citizens in a world whose survival will depend on their contributions. The implications are devastating: If the cure for cancer is incubating in the mind of one of our daughters, we may never find it. Professors Myra and David Sadker have produced a comprehensive, compelling, and essential resource.

                        <p>The Sadkers, top researchers in the field of education for 20 years, have charted how, from elementary school through college and into the working world, girls are systematically denied opportunites in areas where boys are encouraged to excel, often by well-meaning teachers who are unaware they are transmitting sexist values.

A lady of dignity and refinement, she spent her days investigating the squalid world of madness, probing the nation's worst hellholes. Professing conservative feminine values, with furious energy and keen political insight, she invaded the masculine realm of government to press her agenda. Indeed, the secret of her success was to use conventional rhetoric of female subordination and self-denial to camouflage her radical course of political action. A woman of profound religious conviction, Dix believed that God had called her to a divine mission: to become the voice of the mad, speaking for those unable to speak for themselves. Accordingly, she threw herself into her vocation with an all-consuming intensity. Obsessed with the insane, she all but ignored the most celebrated reform movements of her day, women's rights and antislavery. This has led most historians to underestimate her. Yet no Victorian woman matched Dix's record of concrete achievement nor lived a more intrepid life.

                        <p>With vivid and sometimes horrifying detail, Gollaher describes the tireless determination of mental health crusader Dorothea Dix, as she traveled on her own throughout the country visiting jails, prisons, asylums, and almshouses in a heroic effort on behalf of the indigent insane.

The contributors--eight historians and one professor of French--discuss such topics as pornography's links to the development of the novel, images of the whore in French pornography, the Dutch retreat from sexual openness in the late 17th century and the libertine philosophy of John Cleland, author of Fanny Hill. One essay argues that political pornography helped to bring about the French Revolution by undermining the legitimacy of the ancien regime. Comprising the proceedings of a 1991 conference at the University of Pennsylvania, where Hunt is a professor of history, this volume aims to put current debates on pornography in a historical perspective, but too many overspecialized essays weaken its impact.

<p>We all ""do deception"", often with the intention to protect ourselves and the relationships we depend on. <b>The Dance of Deception</b>unravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real — even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave — but misguided — efforts to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women's lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of ""honesty"", we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling.</p>
<p>Sometimes Lerner's advice takes a surprising turn — for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something ""more real""; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a ""hot issue"" without laying the necessary groundwork first.</p>
<p>Whether the subject is affairs, family secrets, sexual faking or the challenge of ""being oneself"", Lerner helps us to discover, speak and live our own truths.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.4519476371 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",14.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/38/9780060924638.jpg,Success,119.0,16.4

—Gloria Feman Orenstein, University of Southern California, author of <i>The Reflowering of the Goddess</i></p>
<p>Alongside the boom in feminist and lesbian scholarship and activism of the last twenty years, there has evolved a distinctive spiritual tradition focused on and revolving around women. This spirituality finds its roots in a number of different traditions, including the Native American, African American, and Euro American traditions. Central to these disparate traditions is the focus on a goddess figure, the centrality of the female principle, and the mending of the separation between mind and body.</p>
<p>Weaving the strands of women's spirituality from different cultures together, Annette van Dyke here addresses the commonalities among these rich traditions. Examining the work and writings of such figures as Leslie Marmon Silko, Paula Gunn Allen, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Starhawk, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Sonia Johnson, and Mary Daly, Van Dyke illustrates how these writers and activists outline a journey toward wholeness - a ""curing ceremony"" - that allows them to reclaim their spirituality from the deadening influence of patriarchal religions. Taken together, their work contributes to a vision of a world based on a female principle, one which exemplifies a lesbian-feminist ethic.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 0.63052206932 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/00/9780814787700.jpg,Success,47.0,16.4

I can't think of a more intimate account of the lives of the overlanders, how they turned their rude wagons into homes, how they made meals both a comfort and a celebration. Some readers will want to try out recipes; others will read in awe as in the midst of difficult travel, women made certain their families marked the Fourth of July with cakes—fruit jelly and sponge-puddings, and ice cream—and clean underwear!""—Lillian Schlissel, author of <i>Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey</i> and <i>Western Women: Their Lands, Their Lives</i>
<p>""This lively book puts the reader squarely on the Oregon Trail—baking bread in a Dutch oven over a campfire, searing buffalo meat, and trading for fresh vegetables and fish. Through emigrant guides, diaries, and 'receipts' of the day, Williams reconstructs the meals that succored emigrants as they crossed the Plains. To understand trail women's contributions to the migration, simply try one of Williams's 'pinch-and-a-handful' recipes—and do it over an open fire in a rainstorm.""—Glenda Riley, author of <i>The Female Frontier: A Comparative View of Women on the Prairie and the Plains</i></p>
<p>""It is tempting to think of <i>Wagon Wheel Kitchens</i> as a feminist supplement to De Voto's <i>Across the Wide Missouri</i>.

Pompous pediatricians, presumptive police, and an eager press cry ""satanism."" Bo knows better. She has long ago learned to heed her heightened perceptions and her own intuition.

But Bo sees no evil here, a feeling underscored by the cult leader, an Iroquois mystic who is as wise as she is ageless. Two other things Bo senses strongly: Paul Massieu is not guilty; and only the truth can free young Hannah from the psychic torment that could destroy her.

She lost her mother at birth, her native Belgium at the age of six, and was forced to flee her adopted France at twelve. It is little wonder that Yourcenar, whose own early past receded so quickly into personal legend, would one day describe her writing as the ""passionate reconstitution , at once detailed and free, of a moment or a man out of the past."" One of the most respected writers in the French language, best known as the author of <i>Memoirs of Hadrian</i> and <i>The Abyss</i>, she was awarded countless literary honors, culminating with her election in 1980 to the Académie Française (she was the first woman ever to be so honored). As complex, erudite, and intriguing as her work, Yourcenar's life has resisted its own passionate reconstitution until now, in part because of the writer's deliberate elusiveness, even in her autobiographical trilogy.</p>
<p>Here, in its intricate and often contradictory detail, is Marguerite Yourcenar's story, one in which loss and learning intertwined almost from the first and in which love assumed a strangely paradoxical place. Drawing on letters, diaries, and interviews with Yourcenar's friends, colleagues, and lovers, Josyane Savigneau's biography paints an intimate portrait of an artist who lived according to her own, occasionally contrary, terms: a Frenchwoman ardently in love with her native tongue, yet who lived half her life in New England; an avid seductress of women, who spent nearly forty years with one woman, yet fell in love early and late in her life with two young men; a powerful female writer whose most memorable protagonists were male, from Alexis of her first novel to the later historical characters Hadrian and Zeno. Savigneau weaves these and other contraries of Yourcenar's life into a vibrant and engrossing pattern.</p>
<p>Editor of ""<i>Le Monde</i> des Livres,"" the literary pages of France's most influential newspaper, Savigneau first met Marguerite Yourcenar on assignment in 1984. What began as a professional relationship gradually turned into a friendship. Her personal insights into that life enrich this exhaustively documented text. Following the lead set by Yourcenar in her memoir <i>Dear Departed</i>, the biographer found herself ""searching for a truth that is multiple, unstable, evasive, sometimes saddening, and at first glance scandalous but that one cannot approach without often feeling for human beings in all their frailty a certain measure of kinship and, always, a sense of pity."" Yourcenar's profound intelligence and sympathy, her foibles and obsessions, her accomplishments and trials: all are revealed here in an uncompromising portrait of an incomparable artist.</p>


                        <p>One of the most respected writers in the French language and best known as the author of Memoirs of Hadrian and The Abyss, Yourcenar received countless literary honors and became the first woman to be elected to the Academie Francaise. An uncompromising and intimate portrait. 50 halftones.

Originally published as a short story, the book opens as Emi, her mother and sister prepare to leave their California home for a new residence: a racetrack that has been turned into a prison camp. Emi's best friend brings her a bracelet as a parting gift. Though Emi vows she will never take it off, the gold chain slips off her wrist as the girl helps clean out the filthy, abandoned stable that will serve as the family's ``apartment.'' After searching for it in vain, Emi eventually realizes that she does not need the bracelet to remember her friend, just as she does not need a photo to remember her father (who has been sent to a prisoner-of-war camp because he worked for a Japanese company); in her mother's words, such important parts of our lives ``we carry in our hearts and take with us no matter where we are sent.''

This breakthrough book shows the fissures in concepts of the gay and lesbian identity and the one-sidedness of both biological essentialist and social constructionist versions of both sexual and gender identity. The editors present an alternative view—sexual and gender expression is a product of complementary biological, personal, and cultural influences in If You Seduce a Straight Person, Can You Make Them Gay?</p>
<p>Through theoretical analysis, ethnographic and empirical data, and case studies, the editors show how the one-sidedness of both biological essentialist and social constructionist versions of sexual and gender identity make it difficult, if not impossible, to conceptually determine the origin of an individual’s sexual expression. This thought-provoking book covers many topics that are sure to cause readers to re-evaluate their thinking about the origins of gay and lesbian identity. Among the topics examined with this fresh perspective are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childhood Cross-Gender Behavior and Adult Homosexuality</li>
<li>Gay and Lesbian Teachers and Coming Out</li>
<li>Homosexuality, Marriage, Fidelity, and the Gay Community: Case of Gay Husbands</li>
<li>Can Seduction Make Straight Men Gay?</li>
<li>Gay and Lesbian Identities in Non-industrialized Societies—Surinam (Dutch New Guinea), Turkey, Nicaragua, and Argentina</li>
<li>Political-Economic Construction of Gay Male Identities
<p>Readers will clearly see that the controversy over the being born gay or becoming gay debate is far from resolved. From the beginning, the book explores how human beings are less constrained by biology than many would like to believe. Social circumstances and economics cause some determination of identity, but not exclusively. Theoretical introductions to each chapter attempt to synthesize elements on both sides of this most contemporary debate.</p>

That question is not whether we will have abortions but what kind of abortions we will have. It is a question framed in stark human terms in Patricia Miller's The Worst of Times, which introduces us to dozens of ordinary Americans who have had firsthand experience with illegal abortion: women who survived the pain, humiliation, shame, and terror; motherless children of women who died; doctors who treated the terrible consequences of botched abortions; the abortionists themselves - barbers, midwives, mechanics; and the cops, coroners, and DAs charged with upholding the law. Abortion is a complex issue, but it is not an issue that exists abstractly in the eyes of ethicists or theologians. It is an issue that exists in the flesh - in the flesh of women with complicated lives and large responsibilities and a whole web of personal, familial, and moral concerns.

This collection is a case in point; it includes the sequence in which a teenage family friend, Lawrence, reveals that he is gay. Sensitive, believable, and moving, Johnston's careful portrayal of this revelation is a landmark in comics. Also included are the For Better or For Worse trademarks: the foibles of teenagers, the terrors of tots, and the trials of marriage. 
<p>Johnston may be most renowned for her rendering of the Patterson family teenagers, Michael and Elizabeth. She's sympathetic to their problems, but also finds fun in their rivalries, their romances, and their insistence on keeping up with the latest - and most expensive - fashion trends.</p>
<p>As the characters age, fans witness them change and mature, giving <i>For Better of For Worse</i> a depth and realism missing from most cartoons. Lynn Johnston's knowing wit creates a strip that's as perceptive as it is funny.</p>

Widely Acclaimed As A Pioneer Of American Social Catholicism, As Well As For Co-founding The Catholic Worker And The Movement By The Same Name, Day's Religious Vision And Lifework Have Played A Dramatic Role In Modern American Catholic History, Profoundly Influencing Consciences. In This Perceptive New Study, Brigid O'shea Merriman, O.s.f., Examines The Development Of Day's Spirituality, Astutely Relating It To Twentieth-century Intellectual And Cultural History. After Her Conversion To Catholicism In 1927, Dorothy Day Met The French Peasant-philosopher Peter Maurin In 1932 And Together They Founded The Catholic Worker Newspaper And Movement. In This Work Day Discovered A Vocation That Would Combine Her Journalistic Skills With Her Long-standing Desire For Sweeping Social Change And Love Of The Poor. Merriman Demonstrates That Day's Leadership Of This Radical Catholic Movement Served As The Locus For The Development And Fruition Of Her Spirituality. A Work Of Intellectual Or Spiritual History Rather Than Biography, Searching For Christ Explores Day's Spiritual Roots In Literature, Especially The Scriptures, Along With Her Sensibility And Her Aesthetic Vision, All Of Which Have Received Too Little Attention Up To Now. The Impact Of Christian Personalism, Monasticism, And The Retreat Movement On Day's Spirituality Are Also Examined, Including New Material On Day's Association With Thomas Merton And A Critical Analysis Of The Lacouture Retreat Movement. Friendship Remained A Necessary Component Of Day's Spirituality, And Merriman's Final Chapter Discusses Day's Devotion To And Enduring Friendship With The Saints, As Well As Her Warm Relationships With A Number Of Her Contemporaries.

0-8014-8145-7,An Ethics of Sexual Difference,"Irigaray, Luce",Cornell University Press,232.0,1993-08-03,,Paperback,"<p>""Who or what the other is, I never know. But the other who is forever unknowable is the one who differs from me sexually. This feeling of surprise, astonishment, and wonder in the face of the unknowable ought to be returned to its locus: that of sexual difference.""&nbsp;Thus Luce Irigaray undertakes a searching inquiry into what may be the philosophical problem of our age.</p>
<p>Irigaray approaches the question of sexual difference by looking at the ways in which thought and language-whether in philosophy, science, or psychoanalysis-are gendered. She juxtaposes evocative readings of classic texts, including Plato's <em>Symposium</em>, Aristotle's <em>Physics</em>, Descartes's ""On Wonder"" in <em>The Passions of the Soul</em>, Spinoza's <em>Ethics</em>, Merleau-Ponty's <em>The Visible and the Invisible</em>, and Levinas's <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, with meditations on experiences of love: between fetus and mother, between heterosexual lovers, between women, and between women and their own bodies.</p>
<p>Exploding traditional dualities such as inside/outside, form/content, subject/object, and self/other, Irigaray shows how an understanding of such experiences points to gender blindness in both classic and contemporary theory. Asserting that women have never known a love of self out of which a non-dominated love of the other is possible, Irigaray argues that only when women insist on the integrity of their own spaces of embodiment can love become the basis of a revolution in ethics.</p>
<p>Published in French in 1984, <em>An Ethics of Sexual Difference</em> is now available in English in a superb translation by Carolyn Burke and Gillian C. Gill. Readers interested in feminist theory, literary theory, and philosophy-indeed anyone deeply concerned with gender relations-will be challenged by the brilliance and boldness of Irigaray's analyses.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/51/9780801481451.jpg,Success,49.0,16.4

The economic problems facing a majority of working women - low pay, job segregation, the added burden of a ""second shift"" at home - are now central to the feminist agenda. At the same time, the labor movement has initiated new ties with women and minority workers, adjusting to fundamental changes in the workplace. Women occupy jobs that are quite different from those held by labor's traditional constituency, the blue-collar hard hat. The new majority tends to work in service jobs, in decentralized workplaces with fewer than fifty employees, and in jobs with less of a permanent, continuous attachment to a single employer. How can unions and women best serve each other and themselves? In this volume, more than forty scholars and activists integrate their experiences to suggest some answers. They discuss ways to close the wage gap and to meet family needs. They explore both the opportunity and the danger of temporary and part-time work, and try to develop a realistic approach to homework. Finally they document new directions in organizing and representing women, and debate the implications of women moving into union leadership.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.5873282864 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/18/9780875463018.jpg,Success,51.0,16.4

Now in a book as fresh, provocative, and fearless as anything else she has written, she shows us how and in what circumstances Americans give birth. At the start, she knew no more of the subject, and not less, than any mother does. Recalling her experiences in the 1930s and 1940s of giving birth - in London, in Washington, D.C., and in Oakland, California - she observes, ""A curious amnesia takes over in which all memory of the discomforts you have endured is wiped out, and your determination never, ever to do that again fast fades."" But then, years later in 1989 - when her own children were adults, and birth a subject of no special interest to her - she meet a young woman, a midwife in Northern California who was being harassed by government agents and the medical establishment. Her sympathies, along with her reportorial instincts, were immediately stirred. There was a story there that needed to be explored and revealed. Far more than she anticipated then, she was at the beginning of an investigation that would lead her over the next three years to the writing of this extraordinary book. This is not a book about the miracle of life. It is about the role of money and politics in a lucrative industry; a saga of champagne birthing suites for the rich and desperate measures for the poor. It is a colorful history - from the torture and burning of midwives in medieval times, through the absurd pretensions of the modest Victorian age, to this century's vast succession of anaesthetic, technological, and ""natural"" birthing fashions. And it is a comprehensive indictment of the politics of birth and national health. Jessica Mitford explores conventional and alternative methods, and the costs of having a child. She gives flesh-and-blood meaning to the cold statistics.

Recalling her experiences in the 1930s and 1940s of giving birth - in London, in Washington, D.C., and in Oakland, California - she observes, ""A curious amnesia takes over in which all memory of the discomforts you have endured is wiped out, and your determination never, ever to do that again fast fades."" But then, years later in 1989 - when her own children were adults, and birth a subject of no special interest to her - she meet a young woman, a midwife in Northern California who was being harassed by government agents and the medical establishment. Her sympathies, along with her reportorial instincts, were immediately stirred. There was a story there that needed to be explored and revealed. Far more than she anticipated then, she was at the beginning of an investigation that would lead her over the next three years to the writing of this extraordinary book. This is not a book about the miracle of life. It is about the role of money and politics in a lucrative industry; a saga of champagne birthing suites for the rich and desperate measures for the poor. It is a colorful history - from the torture and burning of midwives in medieval times, through the absurd pretensions of the modest Victorian age, to this century's vast succession of anaesthetic, technological, and ""natural"" birthing fashions. And it is a comprehensive indictment of the politics of birth and national health. Jessica Mitford explores conventional and alternative methods, and the costs of having a child. She gives flesh-and-blood meaning to the cold statistics. Daring to ask hard questions and skeptical of soft answers",en,,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/88/9780452270688.jpg,Success,115.0,16.4

The book suggests that everyone seeks psychic complementarity with an Other in intimate relationships as a way of supporting personal growth and development. A complementary partner is one who is different in some individually meaningful way, not necessarily in terms of gender. Drawing upon interviews with individuals and lesbian couples, literature on lesbian psychology, and contemporary psychoanalytic theory, Beverly Burch observes a special attraction between primary lesbians - women who have been attracted to other women from an early age - and lesbians who formerly were heterosexual. This difference may be a source of tension for lovers, but it also attracts and bonds them in conscious and unconscious ways. The intimacy between lesbian partners permits interpersonal exchanges that foster the continuing development of each, according to Burch. This development can occur in three areas, with the significance of each varying from couple to couple. It can be a source of both conscious and unconscious psychosexual exchanges, a way in which each partner can experience the road not taken through her relationship with the other. The partners' different histories can reflect different ways of negotiating difference itself, a pivotal theme in the development of adult women. And gender role identities related to different developmental experiences can be played with, expanding the experience of being female in a way that can challenge gender categories.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/15/9780252018015.jpg,Success,48.0,16.4

Instead, Mandelker Reads Tolstoy As A Radical Feminist At The Vanguard Of Russia's Woman Question Debates And Anna Karenina As A Modernist Novel That Breaks Tradition. Mandelker's Revisionist Analysis Begins With The Contention That Anna Karenina Rejects The Textual Conventions Of Realism And The Stereo-typical Representation Of Women, Especially In Victorian English Fiction. In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy Uses The Theme Of Art And Visual Representation To Articulate An Aesthetics Freed From Gender Bias And Class Discrimination. As Mandelker Shows, Tolstoy Compares The Theme Of The Representation Of Women In Society With The Representation Of Women In Art To Critique Western Bourgeois Traditions That Trivialize The Beautiful As A Feminine Category In Aesthetics And A Purchasable Commodity In Society. In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy Both Creates And Theorizes An Aesthetics That Transcends Boundaries And Liberates The Individual. .

In Self And Community In The Fiction Of Elizabeth Spencer, Conceived As A Comprehensive Introduction To Spencer's Work, Terry Roberts Argues Persuasively For A Reevaluation Of The Mississippi Native's Writing, Demonstrating Clearly That Throughout A Career Of Thirty-five Years Spencer Has Sustained A Unique, Profound Artistic Vision Based On The Idea Of Community, Examining Ever More Closely Its Texture And Implications, As Her Writing Technique Has Grown Increasingly Sophisticated. The Idea Of Community And The Individual's Relationship To It Has Pervaded Southern Literature, And As Roberts Reveals, That Theme Runs Throughout Spencer's Novels As Well, Even When Their Settings Are Not In The South. In Her Early Novels, Such As The Voice At The Back Door (1956) And This Crooked Way (1952), Spencer Uses Traditional Narrative Form And An Objective Viewpoint In Setting The Action Of Her Books Within The Context Of A Small Southern Community. With The Light In The Piazza (1960) And Knights And Dragons (1965), Both Set In Italy, She Shows A Growing Interest In Characters Alienated From, Though Still Strongly Affected By, Their Community. In Her Next Stage Of Writing, In Cosmopolitan Novels Such As No Place For An Angel (1967) And The Snare (1972), Spencer Examines More Complex Social Communities Marked By Late-twentieth-century Anxieties And Dislocations, And Penetrates The Psyches Of The Disaffected And Alienated. She Also Experiments With New Techniques In Narrative Structure, Chronology, Imagery, And Point Of View As Means To Dramatize How An Individual Both Shapes And Is Shaped By The Surrounding Community. Unfortunately, Many Reviewers And Critics Misunderstood Spencer's Innovative Fiction. And Ironically, Roberts Maintains, It Was Just As Her Work Was Becoming Less Accessible That She Was Making Her Greatest Strides Artistically. Beginning With No Place For An Angel, For Example, Spencer Was Moving Toward A Complex And Subtle Treatment Of Spiritual Reconciliation In Her Novels, Mirroring A Sort Of Artistic Reconciliation In Her Mastery Of Balance Between Content And Technique. The Snare, The Salt Line (1984), And The Night Travellers (1991) Are Spencer's Best Portrayals Of People Stripped Of Communal Definition And Support. Roberts Examines Spencer's Work In Chronological Order, Typically Discussing One Novel Per Chapter, And Treating Her Short Stories In A Separate Chapter. He Has Had Several Long Interviews With Spencer, And He Draws On Them To Refine His Understanding Of Her Fiction. Self And Community In The Fiction Of Elizabeth Spencer Leaves No Doubt That This Writer Merits A More Prominent Place In American Literature. Roberts' Straight-forward, Clearly Written Introduction To Her Work Will Be Welcomed By The Scholar And General Reader Alike.

A striking characteristic surfaces from the slew of similar questions being asked and responded to again and again in these pages. If Erdrich and Dorris have forged a distinctive partnership—and it appears they have—it is due in part to their fearless acceptance of an unprecedented level of creative participation in each other's writing.

The writings in this lively collection examine the changes it has brought to women and girls of all ages and backgrounds in the West Bank and Gaza. The stories reveal how women are responding to the growing conflict between the demands of tradition and honour on the one hand, and the economic and political realities of life under occupation on the other. Terry Atwan's story is of just such a fight; against the barriers of tradition and oppression by the occupiers. Yusra Berberi, born in 1923 in Gaza, gives a personal account of women's political participation over the many years of conflict. Rita Giacaman writes of the effects on women's health of discrimination against girls, while Amni Rimawi describes her role as vice-president of a trade union. A short story by Hannan Ashrawi of Bir Zeit University (and a leading figure in the peace process) follows 18-year old Iman Jardallah's moving account of life under siege, and Rana Salibi's testimony of women's roles in the popular committees. Ebba Augustin's introductions weave the writings together into a vivid picture of contemporary Palestinian life. What emerges throughout the book is the intensity of the pressure on Palestinian society. For many people, a way of coping with this has been to advocate a return to tradition - what Najah Manasra calls 'going back to the roots'. The victims of this trend are Palestinian women, and what is in danger now is not just the future position of women, but the very ability, without women's active involvement, to sustain the Intifada itself.<br>",en,,"Height: 8.56 Inches, Length: 5.36 Inches, Weight: 0.72311621936 Pounds, Width: 0.6748018 Inches",22.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/48/9781856492348.jpg,Success,70.0,16.4

The seven women represented in this groundbreaking anthology - the only collection of Restoration and eighteenth-century plays devoted exclusively to women - had but one thing in common: the desire to ignore convention and write for the stage. In 1660, when theatres in England reopened after years of Puritan repression, women trod the boards as actors for the very first time. By the end of the century they had stormed and breached another bastion of the male domain and become dramatists as well. Most available collections of plays from the period exclude them; traditional criticism overlooks or diminishes them. But their works, as seen here, hold their own against the most popular productions for the theater from 1678 to 1787, and do it with a distinctively female spirit. Each of these English women, and the one American, Mercy Otis Warren, legitimized the profession of playwright for their sex. They were the genre's prolific women pioneers whose body of work has remained unmatched until the twentieth century.",en,,"Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.39 Inches, Weight: 1.0692419707 Pounds, Width: 1.56 Inches",34.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/06/9780452011106.jpg,Success,115.0,16.4

This virtual sorcerers' manual is a pioneering work of women's spirituality.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In Arizona in the late 1960s, the author, a jobless 20-year-old, estranged from her family and generally disillusioned with life, met Clara Grau, an enigmatic woman who invited her to her home in Sonora, Mexico. Abelar accepted, unaware that her visit would be permanent and would change her life completely. She learned she had been chosen by a group of sorcerers trained by Yaqui Indian Don Juan Matus--mentor of Carlos Castaneda--to join their search for ways to alter normal perceptions and enter other realities. The culmination of this training is the ``crossing'' of the title: the ``abstract flight'' from the concrete, physical world to its ethereal, abstract counterpart. To accomplish this requires spiritual energy built up through rigorous mental and spiritual training, including, for the author, acquiring a doctorate in anthropology. Abelar's account of her training is mesmerizing; the overall mood of events taking place in the Grau home is dreamlike. The book is a good choice for readers interested in mysticism and spiritual matters.

Here is the debut of a refreshing and beguiling mystery series with a new sleuth in the time-honored tradition of Miss Marple - yet with a brilliant deductive style that's all her own. Elizabeth Elliot is a widow of some years and considerable moral authority. Since girlhood she has drawn inner strength from her beloved Quaker worship and just recently has been elected to serve as clerk of the Quaker Meeting in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Elizabeth's worries about her ability to carry out the everyday duties of the job - leading the congregation in prayerful meditation, balancing the budget, etc. - are put aside, though, when she receives the shocking news that a prominent member of the meeting has been found murdered in his garden! The victim is John Hoffman, a wealthy businessman near retirement who is just preparing, he has announced to the entire congregation, to alter his will. Obviously many people would rather he did not leave most of his estate to charity, yet the police focus their investigation on Tim, a young homeless man who attends the meeting and whom John Hoffman occasionally hired to work in his garden. Not surprisingly, Tim is unable to supply a convincing alibi, yet Elizabeth is certain that he is innocent. She rises to the occasion, standing up to the police, who are eager to convict an indigent man, and doing some wildly inventive and daring detective work that makes surprising use of Quaker practices and philosophy. Before she finally confronts the killer, Elizabeth will sift through a myriad of red herrings and seemingly unrelated clues and secrets. For within the blessed ""Quaker silence"" is greed, forbidden love, and vengeful anger struggling to find a voice. Mixing timeless philosophy with contemporary concerns, Irene Allen's Quaker Silence marks the beginning of an outstanding mystery series.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",17.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/48/9780679414148.jpg,Success,87.0,16.4

She was the most influential forerunner of today's feminist movement, who nonetheless seemed to live in the shadow of a great man. So goes one of the great cultural legends of our time. The only problem, as Kate and Edward Fullbrook point out in this beautifully written and meticulously researched portrait, is that it is wrong. Using newly available documentary evidence from diaries and letters, the authors shed astonishing new light on precisely who was the dominant partner in this relationship. By carefully tracing the dates of composition of some of Beauvoir's and Sartre's major works, the Fullbrooks demonstrate that Beauvoir, rather than Sartre, was the primary creative influence behind the couple's most celebrated ideas. In writing his acclaimed Being and Nothingness, Sartre acted primarily as an interpreter of a philosophical system already worked out in Beauvoir's novel, She Came To Stay. This astonishing discovery is at the heart of the Fullbrooks' absorbing account of Beauvoir's and Sartre's childhoods and their first twenty years together as a couple who changed the intellectual outlook of the world. By reworking the chronologies of the couple's writings and rereading old information in light of the new, the Fullbrooks arrive at a revisionary account of the couple's intimate lives, whose radical sexual freedom must now be understood as stemming from Beauvoir's rather than from Sartre's personal needs. The book provides decisive insights into the lives, literature, and ideas of two major figures on the modern cultural scene, and raises profound questions as to the psychological needs, sexual politics, and bad faith that led Beauvoir and Sartre to give misleading accounts of the inner workings of their relationship. Kate and Edward Fullbrook have written a book destined to be widely discussed and hotly debated.",en,"First Edition, First Printing","Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",25.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/71/9780465078271.jpg,Success,119.0,16.4

Each of the essays argues that conservative critics have misread and misunderstood the importance of humor in the works of these women authors, and that women's humor serves to explode conventions oppressive to women and to offer women readers a critique of, and an alternative perspective on, the dominant cultural ideologies that contain and oppress them. The book concludes that these authors strategically deployed humor, coded in forms that women readers - but not men readers - would recognize and understand, as a means of educating and empowering those women readers. Barreca asserts that much of women's comic play has to do with power and its systematic misappropriation, allowing women to gain perspective by ridiculing the implicit insanities of a patriarchal culture. Using detailed persuasive new readings of various works of each of her chosen authors, she shows how the straightjacket of conventional femininity is challenged, confronted, and finally, thrown off. This volume demonstrates that comedy can effectively channel anger and rebellion by first making them appear to be acceptable and temporary phenomena, and then by harnessing the released energies, rather than dispersing them. This kind of comedy, which is at the heart of Untamed and Unabashed, terrifies those who hold order dear.

Together The Contributions Document Recent Significant Shifts Occurring In The Theoretical Approach To The Texts They Study And Illustrate How Shifts In Each Of These Categories Affect How The Others Are Viewed. The First Section Of This Anthology Explores The Notion That Identity - Particularly Gender Identity - Is A Cultural Construct. The Essays In The Second Section Consider Ways In Which Race And Gender Intersect With Cultural Identity And How Encounters Between Different Cultures Challenge Any Identity Constructed In Isolation. First Published In The Journal Criticism, These Essays Offer No Blueprint For Reading. Instead They Encourage A Rereading Of Canonical Texts And A Questioning Of How These Texts Face Matters Of Gender, Race, And Cultural Identity; How They Respond To The Differences And The Incongruities Within The Cultures From Which They Arise; And To Which They Speak.

Today A Woman Relies On What She Sees In A Test Result Or A Digital Sonogram Image To Confirm Her Pregnancy. A Private Experience Once Mediated By Women Themselves Has Become A Public Experience Interpreted And Controlled By Medical Professionals. In Disembodying Women Barbara Duden Takes A Closer Look At This Contemporary Transformation Of Women's Experience Of Pregnancy. She Suggests That Advances In Technology And Parallel Changes In Public Discourse Have Reframed Pregnancy As A Managed Process, The Mother As An Ecosystem, And The Fetus As An Endangered Species. Drawing On Extensive Historical Research, Duden Traces The Graphic Techniques - From Anatomists' Drawings To Woodcuts To X Rays And Ultrasound - Used To Flay The Female Body And Turn It Inside Out.^ Emphasizing The Iconic Power Of The Visual Within Twentieth-century Culture, Duden Follows The Process By Which The Pregnant Woman's Flesh Has Been Peeled Away To Uncover Scientific Data. Lennart Nilsson's Now Famous Photographs Of The Embryo Published In Life Magazine In The Mid-1960s Stand In Stark Contrast To Representations Of The Invisible Unborn In Medieval Iconography Or Sixteenth-century Painting. Illumination Has Given Way To Illustration, Ideogram To Facsimile, The Contemplative Intuition Of The Body To A Scientific Analysis Of Its Component Parts. New Ways Of Seeing The Body Produce New Ways Of Experiencing The Body. Because Technology Allows Us To Penetrate That Once Secret Enclosure Of The Womb, The Image Of The Fetus, Exposed To Public Gaze, Has Eclipsed That Of Woman In The Public Mind. Society, Anxious About The Health Of The Global Environment, Has Focused On Protecting Life In The Maternal Ecosystem, In Effect, Pitting Fetus Against Mother.^ Duden's Reading Of The Body Lends A Unique Historical And Philosophical Perspective To Contemporary Debate Over Fetal Rights, Reproductive Technologies, Abortion, And The Right To Privacy.

Written by community activists, health professionals, and scholars in the social sciences and humanities, the essays address the interconnections of psychological and physical health; ideas of traditional medicine among various minority groups; historical perspectives of culture as a factor in medicine; breast cancer; and health issues affected by federal and institutional policy: rape and domestic violence, reproductive rights, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted disease. Women of color, who make up a large number of the nation's poor, disproportionately face the pressing problems and consequences of infant mortality and poor pediatric care, drug and alcohol abuse, chronic disease, psychological stress, physical endangerment and homicide, and the likelihood that they will die at a younger age than whites. Minority women are also less likely to have personal physicians, to have quality health insurance coverage, or to be treated with respect and understanding in negotiating with health care institutions. However, many have as resources belief systems and traditions of caretaking, expertise, and mutual understanding that broaden dominant ways of perceiving well- or ill-being in the world. Thus their stories are about both oppression and empowerment, victimization as well as the strength to reshape and redefine. The emphasis in this collection is on changing perception, giving voice, and addressing the issues of racial discrimination. There is also discussion of solutions: ways to personal empowerment and better health; ways of changing outreach to more equitably instill the benefits of preventive education; ways of altering the structures of care offered through health institutions; and ways to think about self-help. With some notable exception's, recent feminist scholarship about women's health and the history of health care has focused primarily on",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.16 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",26.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/21/9780814323021.jpg,Success,43.0,16.4

It Has Been Natural That The Study Of Antebellum Southern Women Has Concentrated Upon The Married, Writes Michael O'brien In His Substantive And Moving Introduction. In This, Southern Scholarship Has Not Distinguished Itself From The Main Currents Of Women's History. At The Center Of Our Understanding Has Grown To Be The Plantation Mistress. We Have Been Offered Varying Versions Of Her - As Victim, As Heroine, As Exploiter, As Quasi-abolitionist, As Proslavery Ideologue - But Her Centrality Has Been Assumed. Yet The Unmarried Woman Was Not A Rare Phenomenon. Single Women, With Widows And Young Unmarried Women, Made Up Almost Half Of The Adult Female Population. By Looking At Single Women, An Evening When Alone Restores Some Balance And Brings To Light Single Women's Private Journals, To Which They Habitually Devoted Much Time And Care. This First Volume To Come From The Southern Texts Society Presents The Journals Of Four Very Different Women Who, Although Their Lives Were Worlds Apart, Lived And Wrote In The South During The Years 1827-67. The First Is Elizabeth Ruffin Of Evergreen Plantation In Virginia, Whose Two Short Journals Convey A Sharp, Ironic Sensibility Reminiscent Of Jane Austen. Then There Is A Governess (whose Identity Is A Matter Of Interesting Dispute) In Her Early Thirties, Beginning An Independent Career And Living In Some Discomfort On A Mississippi Plantation Near Natchez Between 1835 And 1837. The Third, Janet Caroline North Of South Carolina, Shows In Her 1851-52 Journals The High-society Belle On Alert And Gossipy Patrol At The Virginia And New York Springs. Finally, There Is Ann Lewis Hardeman, Growing Old In The Midst Of An Extended Family Near Jackson, Mississippi, Struggling To Bring Up Her Dead Sister's Children And Endure The Civil War And Illness With Bleak Fortitude And Religious Intensity.. These Journals Will Appeal To Anyone Who Takes Pleasure In The Diarists' Human Resonance, Their Explication And Observation Of Ordinary Joys And Travails; Courtship, Disappointed Love, Illness, The Gratifications And Pain Of Female Friendship, The Ambivalences Of Family Life, The Grief Caused By The Civil War, The Troubles Occasioned By Men, And The Difficulty And Consolation Of Religion.--book Jacket.

Not Only Was Her Work Among The Most Exciting And Innovative Published In The 1930s, It Was Unique In Portraying An Avant-garde Woman's View Of Women In Sao Paulo During That Audacious Period. Industrial Park, First Published In 1933, Is Galvao's Most Notable Literary Achievement. Like Doblin's Portrayal Of Berlin In Alexanderplatz Or Biely's St. Petersburg, It Is A Book About The Voices, Clashes, And Traffic Of A City In The Middle Of Rapid Change. It Includes Fragments Of Public Documents As Well As Dialogue And Narration, Giving A Panorama Of The City In A Sequence Of Colorful Slices. The Novel Dramatizes The Problems Of Exploitation, Poverty, Racial Prejudice, Prostitution, State Repression, And Neocolonialism, But It Is By No Means A Doctrinaire Tract. Galvao's Ironic Wit Pervades The Novel, Aspiring Not Only To Describe The Teeming City But Also To Put Art And Politics In Each Other's Service. Like Many Of Her Contemporaries, Galvao Was A Member Of The Brazilian Communist Party. She Attracted Party Criticism For Her Unorthodox Behavior And Outspokenness. A Visit To Moscow In 1934 Disenchanted Her With The Communist State, But She Continued To Militate For Change Upon Returning To Brazil. She Was Imprisoned And Tortured Under The Vargas Dictatorship Between 1935 And 1940. In The 1940s She Returned To The Public Through Her Journalism And Literary Activities. She Died In 1962.

The Twelve Essays, Reflecting Current Trends In Renaissance Scholarship In The United States, Analyze The Formation Of Women's Literary Identity By Exploring The Works Of Eight Of The Most Frequently Read Women Writers Of This Period. The Genres Considered Include Sonnets (louise Labe, Catherine Des Roches); Elegies (louise Labe, Pernette Du Guillet); Memoirs (marguerite De Valois); Novellas (marguerite De Navarre); Translations, Plays, And Dialogues (catherine Des Roches, Marguerite De Navarre); Dedicatory Epistles (louise Labe, Helisenne De Crenne, Jeanne Flore, Marie De Gournay); And Novels (marie De Gournay). Although The Essays Differ Considerably In Approach - Spanning Historical, Textual And Intertextual, Political, And Psychoanalytic, Or Drawing On Structuralist And Post-structuralist Theories Of Narrative And Reader Reception - Each Views The Text From A Feminist Perspective. The Essays Are Grouped Into Three Sections That Reflect Major Characteristics Of The Works Of French Renaissance Women. Part One Examines Three Revisionary Practices In Relation To Dominant Codes: Women Writers Define A Female Reading Community To Empower The Female Speaker; Demystify The Illusion Of Mastery Inscribed In Male Myths And Encode These Myths With The Topos Of Female Creative Bonding; And Privilege The Private Over The Public In A Genre Such As The Memoirs That Was Hitherto Limited To Narrating Public Events. Part Two Focuses On The Female Body, An Object Mastered And Seduced In Male Ideology. The Essays Discuss How Women Writers De-emphasize And Ultimately Transcend The Female Body. Finally, The Essays In Part Three Deal For The Most Part With The Politics Of Reception By Examining How Women Writers Maneuver Within The Social Restrictions Of Their Time To Negotiate Their Entry Into The Public World Of Print. A Collective Awareness Of The Determining Role Of Gender Marks The Essays In This Volume, Providing Fresh Insights Into The Works Of Renaissance Women Writers. Women Addressing Women / Deborah N.

Esi, a woman living in Accra, Ghana, takes her career as a data analyst for the government seriously. An incident of marital rape, the result of her husband's anger at Esi's independence, leads to their separation. She is attracted to a married man named Ali who offers to make her his second wife. At first the arrangement appeals to Esi--she can make her work a priority--but eventually Ali's constant traveling and the way he puts off coming to see her begins to bother her. Aidoo makes use of different formats. Occasionally she provides an explanation in the form of a poetic note embedded in the text, and there are spurts of conversation in script form. In one such section Esi's mother and grandmother discuss her choice. Esi's no-nonsense grandmother says, ``Leave one man, marry another. What is the difference?''
