These include cultural, individual and media responses to HIV/AIDS, stigmatization and discrimination, perceptions of risk, and issues to do with counselling, care and health promotion. This new series of books brings together work from many disciplines including psychology, sociology, cultural and media studies, anthropology, education and history. Many of the titles offer insight into contemporary research priorities and identify some of the opportunities open to those involved in care and health promotion. The series will be of interest to the general reader, those involved in education and social research, as well as scientific and medical researchers who want to examine the social aspects of AIDS.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Most of the contributions were first presented at the 6th Conference on Social Aspects of AIDS in 1992, in London (most of the contributors are British). Fifteen papers address such issues as young men and safer heterosexual sex; characteristics and sources of casual sexual partners among gay and bisexual men; the use of indigenous interviewers to access hidden populations; responses to drug use; and anthropology and the culture of HIV/AIDS voluntary organizations.

1-56478-045-7,American Woman in the Chinese Hat (American Literature),"Maso, Carole",Dalkey Archive Press,201,5/1/1994,"Travel, Europe",Hardcover,"<p>Carole Maso's stunning, erotic fourth novel chronicles the dark, irresistible adventures of an American writer named Catherine who has come to France to live. Set into motion by a single act of abandonment-Catherine's lover of ten years has left her-she falls deeper and deeper into an irretrievable madness. With passionate abandon and detachment Catherine pursues her own destruction. Forcing the boundaries of identity and the limits of her eroticism, she enters a series of blinding sexual encounters with a poet, a fascist, a young Arlesian woman, a fireman, and three thieves. Eerily she splits herself in two so that she is both the one who watches and the one who is watched, creator and creation, author and character, as she observes herself from afar And I would like to help her, the one who watches says, but I can't. Finally she meets Lucien, the solitary, cynical, beautiful man with long hair who looks as though he has stepped out of an unmade film by the dead Truffaut, and through this mysterious, doomed, bittersweet liaison Catherine makes one last attempt to halt her decline through the redemptive act of story-telling. She begins to invent the story of their lives, telling it to him half in English, half in French, joining their solitudes for a moment before losing forever her belief that the shapely, hopeful prospects of narrative make sense of expenence. She notices how everything is given up or taken away as she loses the power of the imagination or memory or the body to console, and finally of language to convey meaning. This mesmerizing drama of sex, betrayal, and dissolution with its shattering inevitable conclusion is played out against the dazzling backdrop of the beautiful, indifferent Cote d'Azur in summer. Written in a dwindling lexicon with a simple, warped musicality, The American Woman in the Chinese Hat is a dark, uncompromising, seductive work of art.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Catherine, 33, beautiful and vibrant, bisexual (though preferring women) and passionately driven as a writer, drifts through the bars and bedrooms of Vence on the French Riviera seeking sexual partners. Maso's ( Ghost Dance ) enchanting fourth novel unfolds in a fragmented, poetic prose that is exciting, delicious and lucid. Jilted by Lola, her American lover, Catherine tries to quell her emotional turmoil with a chain of lovers, finally connecting with Lucien, a sweet longhaired youth she picks up at the village fountain. Under the glaring Cote d'Azur sun, Catherine feels herself ignited by a manic misery she compulsively funnels into her writing. Language is the shape of her pain and her desire: she continually inscribes her life as she experiences it, reinventing herself in the pages of her notebook. Maso remains in control of her preoccupation with the writerly act, e.g., splitting Catherine's identity into third- and first-person narratives, maintaining one voice that is mischievously aloof. Paradoxically, the author presents the novel as a finished artifact, yet creates an illusion of improvisation as Catherine suffers and scribbles. The fountain forms a recurrent motif, along with images of birds and radiant light, until the novel's striking finale.

1-55659-065-2,Soul Make a Path Through Shouting,"Cassells, Cyrus",Copper Canyon Press,96,7/1/1994,,Paperback,"<p>Soul Make a Path Through Shouting is Cyrus Cassells' second book. His first, The Mud Actor, was selected for the National Poetry Series by Al Young in 1982. Enriched both mythologically and experientially by world travels, Cassells makes the vital journey inward, a search for spiritual grace among ""hen feathers, rubble, shards of broken dolls"" in Afghanistan or among the vantage-points of the Pyrenees. He draws with equal ease from classical Greek mythology and experientially by his world travels, oral traditions, and others, and the result is an often hypnotic and rhapsodic interweaving of dramatic narratives forming a single whole. He celebrates the dignity and courage of a girl on her way to school in 1957, knowing as only an authentic poet can, that this is the real history, the real and necessary song of a world. Soul Make a Path Through Shouting is a virtuoso performance.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Cassells's writing strikes a balance between exquisite language and an empathy for anyone who is forced to suffer. And at first, the two might seem incompatible: the first draws on the resources of beauty, while the second must be harsh and real in order to be credible. The book's themes call for a tough language that can adequately haul the burden of oppression; the author attempts to combine his love of ornate phrasing with scenes of violence, shooting for a new effect, a sort of rhapsody of pain. It's surprising how often he makes an impact. Like Pasternak, Cassells excels at merging a sleeping landscape with a moment of crisis. If the goal is to prod us to remember history's atrocities, our constant shudder through the middle sequence of short poems (such as ``These Are Not Brushstrokes,'' ``Search'' and ``The Request'') validate the writer's success. Soul Make a Path Through Shouting presents a new creature in the bestiary of contemporary poetry, related to the leopard: tranquil, regal and sophisticated, with an eye on the jugular.

In September, Just Weeks Before Her Fourteenth Birthday, She Contracted Severe Paralytic Polio. Within A Few Days, She Was Irreversibly And Almost Totally Paralyzed From The Neck Down, Unable Even To Breathe By Herself. Today, With The Aid Of A Supported Leather Sling, She Can Make Halting Partial Use Of Some Fingers Of Her Right Hand, But She Cannot Walk, She Cannot Sit Unassisted, She Cannot Move From One Position To Another, She Cannot Feed Herself, She Cannot Comb Her Hair, She Cannot Scratch An Itch On The End Of Her Nose. Tales From Inside The Iron Lung Is Regina's Extraordinary View Of A Life Lived Under Burdens Unimaginable To Most People; It Is Also A Story Of The Remarkable Resilience Of The Human Spirit.

Instead, She Shows That Ghastly Irreversible Illness Need Not Destroy Joy, Intellect, Curiousity, Love Of Life, Or A Rich Existence.

This two-volume collection of her memoirs, edited by her sister and published in 1892, records North's remarkable travels. Laden with her palettes and easels, the independent North travelled alone and fended for herself. Her journals describe how she endured swarms of insects, scaled cliffs, trudged through wilderness and crossed swamps in order to reach the plants she wanted to paint. Volume 2 covers North's travels to Australia and New Zealand, which she undertook at the suggestion of Charles Darwin. The work concludes with the last journey she made, to Chile in 1884–5, to paint the monkey-puzzle tree in its natural habitat. This autobiography reveals the stories behind North's art, which can still be appreciated today since her vivid paintings are displayed at Kew Gardens.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",65,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/95/9780813914695.jpg,Success,62,16.6

0-8070-8332-1,Minnie's Sacrifice: Sowing and Reaping Trial and Triumph : Three Rediscovered Novels (BLACK WOMEN WRITER SERIES),"Harper, Frances E. W.",Beacon Pr,352,1994,,Hardcover,"In one of the most significant literary finds since the publication of Harriet Wilson's Our Nig, Frances Smith Foster has rediscovered three novels by Frances E. W. Harper, the best known African-American woman writer of the nineteenth century. Originally serialized in issues of the Christian Recorder, the official journal of the A.M.E. Church, these novels are the first substantial body of fiction known to have been written for a specifically African-American audience. They also correct the assumption that the classic, Iola Leroy, was Harper's only novel. Using the popular nineteenth-century form of the sentimental novel, Harper draws us into the social problems faced by ""middle-class"" African-Americans after the Civil War. The heroine of Minnie's Sacrifice must weigh the social benefits of passing for white against her desire to join the African-American struggle for equality and justice. Sowing and Reaping focuses on the issue of temperance, and domestic issues of courtship and marriage form the basis for Trial and Triumph, a lively drama about finding a suitable mate. With timeless themes of social justice, social responsibility, and sexuality, as well as further illuminating the importance of black church teachings in African-American literature, these novels shed light on the lives of nineteenth-century African-Americans. Their discovery promises to change dramatically our understanding of American literature.

                        <p>Frances Smith Foster offers three recovered novels by the best-known African-American woman writer of the 19th century. Author of the classic Iola Leroy, Frances E. W. Harper's fiction offers genuine insight into the lives of black Americans in the post-bellum era. ""A major contribution.""--William L. Andrews, editor of Sisters of the Spirit.

But she has no idea what she's getting into when she agrees to work for infamous antiques dealer Elliot Littlefield.<P>The first day on the job she and her crew discover the bloodied body of a young woman in a bedroom &#151; and are soon on the trail of a priceless Civil War diary stolen by the killer. As if two crimes aren't enough, deadly serious collectors, right-wing radicals, and impulsive teenagers make the case even more difficult to tidy up ... and more dangerous.</p><h3>BookList</h3><p>It's talky, contrived, and too long--but that doesn't mean that this mystery, modeled somewhat after the infinitely better Kinsey Millhone books by Sue Grafton, won't appeal to a solid core of readers. Trocheck's second whodunit starring Callahan Garrity, ex-cop turned cleaning-service entrepreneur cum private detective, finds her heroine involved in the recovery of stolen Civil War collectibles, the murder of a teenage girl, and some dirty dealings by a supposedly benevolent, not-for-profit group finding creative ways to house the homeless. The Atlanta setting, while not artfully rendered, certainly rings true enough, and Trocheck keeps the suspects in and out of the limelight effectively until the real culprits are brought to justice. The novel suffers a bit from stereotyping: every man in the book (save for Callahan's vaguely liberated main squeeze, Mac) is a bit of a jerk, and every women who's not in Callahan's coterie of plucky house cleaners is a bit of a bimbette or just plain pathetic. Callahan's crusty old mom, Edna, does, however, try to keep the proceedings in the proper perspective with her sardonic wit. Not the best but certainly not the worst in the ever-burgeoning ranks of mystery series with female sleuths.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.34 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",6.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/11/9780061091711.jpg,Success,79,16.6

Nahmad draws on herbal and astrological lore from the Celtic pagan tradition of the British Isles; she asserts that the wisewoman's traditions she describes have been passed down from woman to woman for many generations. She herself was made aware of this knowledge by her maternal grandmother. Chapters are organized around signs of the zodiac and convey a mixture of esoteric information and practical wisdom. Specific invocations are given as part of each chapter, but it is cautioned that these should not be rigidly applied.

There's an old saying&#58; Only little children and old folks tell the truth."" In Having Our Say Bessie, age 101, and her sister Sadie, age 103, do just that-and then some. Filled with humorous and poignant anecdotes, this inspiring dual memoir offers a rare glimpse of the birth of black freedom- and the rise of the black middle class-in America. It is a chronicle of remarkable achievement. <P>Sadie and Bessie Delany recall growing up with eight other siblings in turn-of-the-century North Carolina&#58; their father was born in slavery, yet became the nation's first elected black Episcopal bishop; their mother could have ""passed"" for white but chose not to. <P>With irrepressible pluck, the sisters confronted the first days of Jim Crow and legal segregation, and took part in the World War I-era migration North, rising to professional prominence during the heyday of Harlem. Along the way they met such legendary figures as black leaders Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois and entertainers Cab Calloway and Lena Home. Both sisters favored careers over marriage, despite many opportunities. Later, they settled in the still partly-rural Bronx, then integrated a suburban neighborhood in the '50s. <P>Each has triumphed in her own way&#58; <br>""Queen Bess"" with feistiness; ""Sweet Sadie"" with quiet determination. Though warmly skeptical of each other's style, they remain devoted. ""She may be one- hundred-and-one years old, comments Sadie, ""but she's still my little sister."" <P>Today they are fragile, yet fiercely independent. They still live alone in their own house. They make their own peach preserves and their own soap, and don't own a telephone (""it's the biggest nuisance invented by mankind""). Radio keeps them informed-and their opinions on current events are to be reckoned with. <P>Sadie and Bessie Delany's lifelong insights provide us with a priceless oral history of our nation's past century. And what they ""have to say"" shows us, as no one else can, where we've been, how far we've come...and how far we have to go.</p><h3>NY Newsday</h3><p>In fact, this must be the nicest show and inspirational pep rally in town...what a life these women have led, and how lovely to hear about America's real history from witnesses who are such good company.

Judy Nelson, born and raised in Texas and the epitome of the Southern Belle - tall, statuesque, and blond, beautiful and articulate - was a former National Maid of Cotton and a graduate of Texas Christian University. The two came together . . . and the result was Love Match. Judy and Martina first met when Martina was playing a doubles tournament in Fort Worth in 1982. Judy, married and the mother of two sons, was introduced to Martina by her son Eddie, then eleven, who was serving as a ball boy for one of Martina's matches. A friendship grew. For two years the women exchanged cards and phone calls. Then, in March 1984, over a long, uninterrupted lunch, they fell in love. Judy, still married, didn't know what to do, and neither woman was clear about what the declaration of their feelings meant to their lives. What happened thereafter is the explosive substance of Love Match, the unvarnished, objective story of a romance between two women - the choices that were made and the risks that were taken. They made a commitment in church and exchanged rings. For seven years Judy and Martina were inseparable. Then Martina broke off the relationship. Judy was devastated, as were her sons and her parents. At last she decided to act. For she and Martina had agreed, in writing, that each would share in whatever was accumulated during their relationship. The ensuing palimony case engendered headlines around the world - and intensified the heartache. As the two headed for trial, a settlement was reached. The how and why of that settlement are here - along with the details of a very rare and special romance - a love match.                        <p>The fascinating, objective story of the relationship between tennis superstar Martina Navratilova and Texas beauty Judy Nelson, whose palimony suit garnered national media coverage and made headlines around the world.

Now, a century later, women almost everywhere are the majority of voters but a distinct minority of elected officials. This discrepancy is a puzzle for those who thought democratic institutions would incorporate newly enfranchised women, and a problem for those working to expand democratic representation.
<p>Darcy, Welch, and Clark examine women candidates and candidacies in the United States and several other democratic nations. Their careful analysis reveals that male voters and political elites are not the barriers to women's election that common wisdom suggests. Instead, they find that a party's ability to determine candidate selection, along with election procedures that benefit incumbents, produces slow turnover of elected officials and few opportunities for new women candidates. In addition, the authors analyze nomination procedures and election systems to document both the conditions that lead political parties to nominate more women and the mechanisms that yield more victories by women candidates.</p>

Despite the hundreds of archaeology books and articles on monasticism, not one has considered that women's monasticism may have differed from men's. Instead, traditional scholarship has dismissed nunneries as poor or failed monasteries. Although recent historians have begun to re-evaluate their approach to the study of religious women, they have yet to consider the material culture of these monasteries.<p>In its comparison of monasteries for men and women, <b></b><b><i>Gender and Material Culture</i></b> shows how the categories of gender greatly influenced the design and organization of medieval monasteries, their landscape contexts and strategies of economic management, the form and development of buildings and their symbolic and iconographic content. The archaeology of these institutions more specifically reveals stark contrasts in the social and economic status of monasteries and their social links with patrons.

Peeling away layer after layer of personal history to reveal the torment of a fugitive spirit, <b>Missing Joseph</b> is award-winning author Elizabeth George's greatest achievement.</p>",en,Reissue,"Height: 6.87 Inches, Length: 4.16 Inches, Weight: 2.25 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches",7.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/48/9780553566048.jpg,Success,79,16.6

But, As Richard Hall Shows In This Eye-opening History, Women Have Been Distinguishing Themselves On The Battlefield For Far Longer Than Has Been Acknowledged In The History Books. There Were Women Who Went To The Civil War As Nurses, Daughters Of The Regiment, Or Vivandieres, And Those Who Went Disguised As Men, But When The Fighting Began Such Distinctions Were Lost And The Women Would Adapt To Whatever Role Was Necessary. Many Went To Be With Their Boyfriends Or Husbands, Some Went Out Of Patriotism, Others Purely For The Adventure. In Addition To Donning A Uniform And Cutting Their Hair, These Women Often Learned To Drink, Smoke, Chew, And Swear With The Best, Or Worst Of The Soldiers. The Wife Of One Colonel Turchin Even Assumed Command Of A Regiment After Her Husband Had Been Wounded. Some Of The Other Women Covered In This Ground-breaking Account Include Jennie Hodgers, The Longest Serving Woman, Completed A Three-year Term Of Enlistment Serving As Albert Cashier. It Wasn't Until 1911 When She Was Hurt In An Automobile Accident, That Her Identity And Sex Were Discovered; Sarah Emma Edmonds Probably Had The Busiest Civil War. She Served As Private Franklin Thompson In The 2nd Michigan Infantry Regiment, Then As A Spy Disguised Variously As A Black Man And Irish Biddy. Later, When Sarah Contracted Malaria, Franklin Deserted. After Recuperating, She Wrote Nurse And Spy, A Fictionalized Account Of Her Adventures As If Experienced By A Female Nurse. The Book Was A Huge Success. She Resumed The War Effort As A Female Nurse And Met Linus Seelye, Whom She Married After The War's End; Lucy Matilda Thompson Joined The Confederate Forces When Already Aged 49, And, Although She Received Two Shrapnel Wounds To Her Skull Resulting In A Metal Plate Being Permanently Attached, Lived To The Incredible Age Of 112; Loreta Janeta Velazquez, Born To A Wealthy Cuban Family And Raised In New Orleans, Fought In The Battle Of First Bull Run As Lieutenant Harry T.

At its center stands as strong and resilient a heroine as any in American literature. Verna Mae Slone, a native of Knott County, Kentucky, is the author of several books, including the bestselling memoir, What My Heart Wants to Tell.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Set in Eastern Kentucky's Lonesome Holler of the 1920s and '30s, this first novel, an expanded, refocused and retitled edition of Slone's 1982 self-published Sarah Ellen , deals with the harsh life of Rennie Slone. The death of their mother when Rennie is 12 means that Rennie must care for her infant sister, Sarah Ellen, and keep house for her father, a stern Baptist preacher. Though Rennie's hopes for her own education are dashed, she dreams that one day Sarah Ellen will go to high school at Caney Creek Community Center (founded by real-life activist Alice Lloyd). Rennie's days, meanwhile, are brightened by nurse Miss Rose, who lends her books, and by her cousin Johnnie, who sings charming old ditties and grows to love her. Believing she was ``born to be an old maid,'' she spurns his affections, accepting her hard life with grace along with the other enterprising, hardy folk of Lonesome Holler. Through coal mine disasters, the shooting of a young man who loves Sarah Ellen and other deaths, Rennie moves toward realizing her dream for her sister. Though time sequences are sometimes confusing, Slone's style, which includes dialogue written in dialect, is lively. Readers drawn to regional tales will enjoy learning about Lonesome Holler.

Let her introduce you to real people who, like you, fled from anything to do with math. All of them - White, African American, Asian American, Latino, artist, homemaker, manager, teacher, teenager, or grandparent - came to see that their math troubles were not their fault. Social stereotypes, poor schools, and well-meaning parents had convinced them that they couldn't, or shouldn't, do math. Their voices in this book testify to the boost in self-esteem - and income - they enjoyed once they got the tools and motivation they needed to overcome their fear of math. You can join their number! Claudia Zaslavsky shows you how the school math you dreaded is a far cry from the math you really need in life (and probably know better than you ever suspected)! She gives a host of reassuring methods, drawn from many cultures, for tackling real-world math problems. She explodes the myth that women and minorities are not good at math.

In this engaging memoir, Fay Ajzenberg-Selove writes candidly about her difficult journey to international recognition in physics. She is frank about the ways being a woman has made a difference in her opportunities and choices as a scientist--and how, by being a woman, she has made a difference in the world of physics.
<p>Ajzenberg-Selove came to America at the age of 15 after narrowly escaping the Nazi takeover of France. She had planned to become an engineer like her father, but switched to physics after she was told the only engineering jobs open to women were in drafting: Marie Curie's example proved to her that women could do physics. Her first attempt at graduate work at Columbia University was a disaster, but she was sturck with the intellectual beauty of the field. After taking a Ph.D. in physics at University of Wisconsin, she did post-doctoral work with Thomas Lauritsen at the California Institute of Technology, where she began writing the first of a series of major review papers on the nuclear spectroscopy of the light nuclei, a subject of fundamental importance to nuclear physics, astrophysics, and applied physics. She continued this work and experimental research for thirty-eight years while teaching at Boston University, Haverford College, and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>During her early career, Ajzenberg-Selove was shielded by her male mentors from experiencing much of the discrimination directed against women in science. Her simultaneous battles to become a tenured professor and to overcome breast cancer opened her eyes and confirmed her as a feminist.</p>
<p>The lay reader and the scientist alike will be fascinated by Ajzenberg-Selove's clear portrayal of her interlinked lives as physicist, teacher, wife of particle physicist, Walter Selove, and a woman who relishes both competition and friendship in a male-dominated field. An invaluable book for anyone contemplating a career in science.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.7936641432 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",28.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/53/9780813520353.jpg,Success,111,16.6

—<i>Anton Chekhov</i>, writing to his publisher in 1895</p>
<p>Chekhov's barbed comment suggests the climate in which Sophia Parnok was writing, and is an added testament to to the strength and confidence with which she pursued both her personal and artistic life. Author of five volumes of poetry, and lover of Marina Tsvetaeva, Sophia Parnok was the only openly lesbian voice in Russian poetry during the Silver Age of Russian letters. Despite her unique contribution to modern Russian lyricism however, Parnok's life and work have essentially been forgotten.</p>
<p>Parnok was not a political activist, and she had no engagement with the feminism vogueish in young Russian intellectual circles. From a young age, however, she deplored all forms of male posturing and condescension and felt alienated from what she called patriarchal virtues. Parnok's approach to her sexuality was equally forthright. Accepting lesbianism as her natural disposition, Parnok acknowledged her relationships with women, both sexual and non-sexual, to be the centre of her creative existence.</p>
<p>Diana Burgin's extensively researched life of Parnok is deliberately woven around the poet's own account, visible in her writings. The book is divided into seven chapters, which reflect seven natural divisions in Parnok's life. This lends Burgin's work a particular poetic resonance, owing to its structural affinity with one of Parnok's last and greatest poetic achievements, the cycle of love lyrics Ursa Major. Dedicated to her last lover, Parnok refers to this cycle as a seven-star of verses, after the seven stars that make up the constellation. Parnok's poems, translated here for the first time in English, added to a wealth of biographical material, make this book a fascinating and lyrical account of an important Russian poet.

Based on years of research and access to a rich trove of public and private documents, including the diaries of gay men living in New York at the turn of the century, this book is a fascinating look at a gay world that was not supposed to have existed. Focusing on New York City, the gay capital of the nation for nearly a century, George Chauncey recreates the saloons, speakeasies, and cafeterias where gay men gathered, the intimate parties and immense drag balls where they celebrated, and the highly visible residential enclaves they built in Greenwich Village, Harlem, and Times Square. He tours New York's turn-of-the-century sexual underground, including gay bathhouses and backroom saloons. He chronicles the now-forgotten ""pansy craze"" of the Prohibition years, when Times Square's most successful nightclubs featured openly gay entertainers and when drag balls held in Madison Square Garden and Harlem's largest ballrooms drew thousands of spectators and banner headlines in city newspapers. And he reconstructs the codes of dress, speech, and style gay men developed to recognize and communicate with one another in hostile settings, which enabled many men not just to survive but to flourish. Gay New York offers new perspectives on the gay rights revolution of our time by showing that the oppression the gay and lesbian movement attacked in the 1960s was not an unchanging phenomenon. It had intensified in the 1920s and 1930s as a direct response to the visibility of the gay world in those years. Above all, Gay New York shows that our most intimate sexual identities are stunningly recent creations. It depicts a complex prewar sexual culture in which men were not divided into homosexuals and heterosexuals but into fairies, wolves, queers, and ""normal"" men. Many of those ""normal"" men frequently engaged in sexual relation

                        <p>Winner of the 1994 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History, Chauncey's brilliant work challenges the conventional wisdom that before the 1960s gay life existed only in the closet. ""Chauncey's genius here is the way he combines real lives and theory.""--Out. Illustrations.

Here is Heloise writing to Abelard's 'superior wisdom' of 'how much I have lost in you' from twelfth-century Paris; Margaret Paston, the efficient manager of her husband's estate, vividly describing her troubles in affectionate letters to her husband while he was practising law in London during the Wars of the Roses; Elizabeth I firmly but tactfully refusing Erik of Sweden's offer of marriage as she 'highly commends this single life'; Queen Victoria complaining to Sir Robert Peel about the 'disgrace' in the neglect of Buckingham Palace; Jane Austen writing to her sister Cassandra, and Fanny Burney on Dr Johnson; Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf exchanging intimate thoughts on their lives and writing; Lady Mary Wortley Montagu describing how, abandoned by her lover, she rebuilds her life and her garden in Italy 'enjoying every amusement that solitude can afford'; and many more lesser known women whose writing reveals much of their day to day lives and the sometimes restricted world they inhabited. The collection has a wide geographical range: Mary Kingsley writes of her experiences travelling in the Congo, and the voices of women in America, France and Spain, such as George Sand and La Pasionaria, can also be heard. The letters are divided into chapters thematically: How Women View their Roles, Friendship, Childhood and Education, Love and Sexual Passion, Marriage and Childbirth, Housekeeping and Daily Life, Work, War and Alleviating Suffering, Travellers and Travelling, Illness and Ageing, Political Skills. An appendix covers the epistolary novel, and a full bibliography is also included.

0-87805-692-0,Conversations with Toni Morrison (Literary Conversations Series),,University Press of Mississippi,312,4/1/1994,,Paperback,"<p>Without apology Nobel Prize author Toni Morrison describes herself as an African-American woman writer. These collected interviews reveal her to be much more. She has shared space in her creative life for her career in publishing, in teaching, and in being a single parent. Writing, however, is one thing she ""refuses to live without."" These interviews beginning in 1974 reveal an artist whose creativity is intimately linked with her African-American experience and is fueled by cultural and societal concerns. For twenty years she has created unforgettable characters in her acclaimed novels - The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, and Jazz. Morrison tells her interviewers that her goal as a writer is to present African-American life not as sociology but in the full range of its depth, magic, and humanity. ""I want my work to capture the vast imagination of black people,"" she says. ""That is, I want my books to reflect the imaginative combination of the real world, the very practical, shrewd, day-to-day functioning that black people do, while at the same time they encompass some great supernatural element."" Though the scope and the magnitude of her art have brought her international acclaim, even some of her most ardent admirers have viewed her fiction mainly with a focus on class, race, and gender. In these interviews, however, she addresses the artist's concern with moral vision and with a resistance to critical attitudes that categorize black writing largely as sociology. From these interviews comes a greater understanding of Toni Morrison's purpose and the theme of love that streams through her fiction.<P> <B>From Toni Morrison:</B><BR> Critics generally don't associate black people with ideas. They see marginal people. . . sociologically interesting people perhaps but bery parochial. . . . We are people, not aliens. We live, we love, and we die.<P> Black people have a story, and that story has to be heard. There was an articulate literature before there was a print. There were griots. They memorized it. People heard it. It is important that there is sound in my books&#8211;that you can hear it, that I can hear it.</p><h3>Booknews</h3><p>A collection of 24 interviews with the author of The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, and Beloved, arranged chronologically from 1974 to 1992. The interviews reveal an artist whose creativity is intimately linked with her African-American experience and is fueled by cultural and societal concerns. Taken as a whole, the interviews illuminate the evolution of Morrison's purpose as a writer--to present African-American life not as sociology but in the full range of its depth, magic, and humanity.

The Narrator, Margie Potter, Was Only Six Months Old On The Day Her Mother Took Her To The Circus; Her Mother Perished, And Maggie Herself Bears Livid Scars On Her Back. Having Spent Her Youth Repressing Her Memories And Burying Herself In Books, Margie Marries An Intense Fireman, Charlie O'neill, Who Is Singularly Obsessed With The Fire And Determined To Find The Arsonist Whom He Is Certain Set The Blaze. Over The Years Charlie Becomes More And More Compulsive About Tracking Down Leads, Emotionally Distancing Himself From Margie And Their Feisty Daughter Martha. The Clue To His Obsessive Dedication, And To The Arsonist's Identity, Comes Only When Margie Begins To Acknowledge Her Own Complicity In His Monomania. In Matching Her Narrative Tone With Her Heroine's Lower-middle Class Diction And Deliberate Emotional Restraint, The Author Risks A Slow Beginning In Order To Build Suspense In Subtle Increments. She Keeps The Prose Cool And Spare, So That When Harrowing Details And Jolting Surprises Gradually Occur, The Effect Is Potent.

0-300-05924-8,Bisexuality in the Ancient World,"Cantarella, Eva",Yale University Press,296,1/26/1994,,Paperback,"Bisexuality Was Intrinsic To The Cultures Of The Ancient World. In Both Greece And Rome, Same Gender Sexual Relationships Were Acknowledged, And Those Between Men Were Not Only Tolerated But Widely Celebrated In Literature And Art. Nor For Greeks And Romans Was Homosexuality An Exclusive Choice, But Alternative To And Sometimes Concurrent With The Love Of The Opposite Sex. Whilst Exploring Aspects Of The Female Condition In Classical Antiquity, Eva Cantarella Came To Understand That The Sheer Ubiquity Of Male Homosexuality Had A Fundamental Impact On Relationships Between Men And Women. Drawing On The Full Range Of Surviving Sources - Legal Texts, Inscriptions, Medical Documents, Poetry And Philosophical Literature - She Now Reconstructs The Homosexual Cultures Of Greece And Rome And Provides A Full, Readable And Thought-provoking History Of Bisexuality In The Classical Age. Cantarella Explores The Psychological, Social And Cultural Mechanisms That Determined Sexual Choice And Consider: The Extent To Which That Choice Was Free, Directed Or Coerced In Each Civilization. In Greece The Relationship Between Adults And Youngs(sic) Boys Was Deemed The Noblest Of Associations, A Means Of Education And Spiritual Exhaltation(sic). Cantarella Reveals That Such Relationships, Though Highly Regulated And Never Left To Individual Spontaneity, Were More Than Pedagogic And Platonic: They Were Fully Carnal. In Imperial Rome, However, The Sexual Ethic Mirrored The Political And Males Were Cruelly Domineering In Love As In War. The Critical Sexual Distinction Was That Between Active And Passive, The Victims Commonly Being Slaves Or Defeated Enemies, Rather Than Young Roman Freemen. In Terms Of Femalebisexuality, Accounts Of Love Between Roman Women Were Transmitted Exclusively By Men. In Greece, However, Women Had Sappho To Give Them Voice. Cantarella Examines The Activities Of The Thiasoi - Greek Communities Of Women - And Reveals That Their Ritual Ceremonies Also Embraced Passionate Love. Cantarella Explains How The Etiquette Of Bisexuality Was Corrupted Over Time And How, Influenced By Pagan And Judeo-christian Traditions, Homosexuality Came To Be Regarded As An Unnatural Act. Her Interpretation Goes Further Than Any Previous Study, Claiming Not Only That Homosexuality Was Common, But That For Greeks Of Both Genders It Constituted True Love.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 1 Inches, Weight: 1.0141264052 Pounds, Width: 6.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/43/9780300059243.jpg,Success,117,16.6
0-8195-6275-0,Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America (Music / Culture),"Rose, Tricia",Wesleyan University Press,257,5/15/1994,,Paperback,"From its beginnings in hip hop culture, the dense rhythms and aggressive lyrics of rap music have made it a provocative fixture on the American cultural landscape. In Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America, Tricia Rose, described by the New York Times as a ""hip hop theorist,"" takes a comprehensive look at the lyrics, music, cultures, themes, and styles of this highly rhythmic, rhymed storytelling and grapples with the most salient issues and debates that surround it.
<p>Assistant Professor of Africana Studies and History at New York University, Tricia Rose sorts through rap's multiple voices by exploring its underlying urban cultural politics, particularly the influential New York City rap scene, and discusses rap as a unique musical form in which traditional African-based oral traditions fuse with cutting-edge music technologies. Next she takes up rap's racial politics, its sharp criticisms of the police and the government, and the responses of those institutions. Finally, she explores the complex sexual politics of rap, including questions of misogyny, sexual domination, and female rappers' critiques of men.</p>
<p>But these debates do not overshadow rappers' own words and thoughts. Rose also closely examines the lyrics and videos for songs by artists such as Public Enemy, KRS-One, Salt N' Pepa, MC Lyte, and L. L. Cool J. and draws on candid interviews with Queen Latifah, music producer Eric ""Vietnam"" Sadler, dancer Crazy Legs, and others to paint the full range of rap's political and aesthetic spectrum. In the end, Rose observes, rap music remains a vibrant force with its own aesthetic, ""a noisy and powerful element of contemporary American popular culture which continues to draw a great deal of attention to itself.""</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9.08 Inches, Length: 6.16 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/53/9780819562753.jpg,Success,115,16.6

<p>The contributors are Ava Baron, Judith Bennett, Marilyn Katz,&nbsp; Regina Morantz-Sanchez, Nell Painter,&nbsp; Sylvia Schafer, Ann-Louise Shapiro, Mrinalini Sinha, Bonnie Smith, Carolyn Steedman, Jennifer Terry, and Vron Ware.</p>

The human side of the civil war in El Salvador and decades of repression come to the fore in this woman's tale of extraordinary courage and ordinary labor.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>While military solutions to social problems take an awful toll in human suffering, the military's gain in wealth and power is apt to make it reluctant to support peace unless funds are cut off. Tiny, overpopulated El Salvador has recently emerged from a savage 13-year civil war that devastated the country. The war, in reality an agrarian movement to rectify the ownership of over half the land by two percent of the people, gave rise to such human rights abuses that thousands were massacred or fled abroad. Protests by women in turn made them aware of their own status as a disadvantaged group. The author herself was transformed from a peasant to an international human rights activist. Those who know Latin America will not be surprised at her story; a similar story is Nidia Diaz's I Was Never Alone: A Prison Diary from El Salvador (Ocean, 1992).

Early that year, Greenfield met and decided to photograph two young dancers, David Parsons and Daniel Ezralow. She used for the initial session - and for the first time - a borrowed Hasselblad camera. Her excitement at the result was immediate. ""I looked at the print,"" she says, ""and knew I was on to something."" What in fact this chance convergence of elements gave rise to was the archetypal Greenfield image: dynamic, witty, original and full of an energy so forceful that it seems contained only by the black lines of the camera frame. Breaking Bounds is a collection of 87 of these extraordinary images, taken between 1982 and 1991 and representing the best of Greenfield's mature personal work. That period saw her achieve her aim: to liberate the dancer from the dance. ""I tell my dancers,"" she says, ""to leave their choreography at the door,"" and here indeed we see dance as it has never been shown onstage. These are movements which arise through a collaboration between Greenfield and a host of dancers, unrestrained by the bounds of choreography, willing to take risks and to push to the absolute limits the boundaries of both photography and dance. This volume also represents a further collaboration between Greenfield and the eminent photographic historian and curator William A. Ewing, who has arranged these examples of her work into five sections that he calls Solo, Duo, Restraint/Release, Fission/Fusion and Breaking Bounds. He also provides an introduction and an interview with Lois Greenfield that charts her development from a young photojournalist to one of the finest photographers of the day. Lois Greenfield is recognized internationally as among the foremost photographers of dance. By choosing the world of experimental dance as her subject, she has created images of unbeli

                        <p>In this collection of photographs, made between 1982 and 1991, Lois Greenfield's revolutionary work captures the explosive energy and beauty of dancers' bodies in motion, as they present a powerful and elegant depiction of the human body in midair. 87 duotone photographs. 7 halftones.

Sastun is the captivating story of American herbologist Rosita Arvigo's apprenticeship to Don Elijio Panti, one of the last surviving, and most respected, traditional healers of Belize. Set in the imperiled Belizean rainforest that serves as the pharmacy of ancient Mayan medicine, Arvigo's story is an unforgettable personal account as well as a vivid reminder of the need to preserve both the rainforest's irreplaceable plant life and its ancient healing traditions. When Arvigo met Panti, the legendary healer was eighty-seven years old. Slight and sinewy, with failing eyesight and rheumatism, he still ventured into the forest to gather plants and ministered to patients from near and far each day. Arvigo was determined to become Panti's apprentice so that she could learn more about the native plants of Belize. What she discovered instead was her life's work - the quest to sustain and study rainforest plants and bridge the gap between Panti's traditional wisdom and modern healing practices. Making regular, laborious treks to Panti's ramshackle home clinic, Arvigo slowly gains the confidence and respect of the cantankerous, compassionate, and deeply spiritual healer and of the community he serves. We follow the unlikely pair into the jungle to collect plants, listen as Panti teaches Arvigo about the physical and spiritual tools of the healer, and meet unforgettable characters - including the mysterious Carib named Jeronimo who taught Panti the art of healing, a little girl suffering from an intestinal disorder unfathomable to the many doctors her frantic parents have consulted, a woman ""possessed"" and near death because of exposure to the black arts that are the flipside of Panti's white art of healing, and the visiting film crew of a Hollywood movie with an integral part to play in Arvigo's initiation as",en,1,"Height: 11.11 Inches, Length: 6.11 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1.11 Inches",22,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/51/9780062502551.jpg,Success,118,16.6

Together, these experienced, undeterred Nicaraguan women offer powerful clues about a truly revolutionary and democratizing feminism."" --Adrienne Rich<br>
<br>
""Powerful, moving, and challenging. Everyone interested in decency and justice will want to read Sandino's Daughters Revisited."" --Blanche Wiesen Cook<br>
<br>
""If it were not for writers like Margaret, how would women around the world find each other when there is such an institutional effort to keep us apart and silent? Here Margaret brings us the voice of Sandino's daughters, honoring his hat and wearing their own, wiser now, having been part of political and personal revolution."" --Holly Near<br>
<br>
Sandino's Daughters, Margaret Randall's conversations with Nicaraguan women in their struggle against the dictator Somoza in 1979, brought the lives of a group of extraordinary female revolutionaries to the American and world public. The book remains a landmark. A decade later, Randall returned to interview many of the same women and others. In Sandino's Daughters Revisited, they speak of their lives during the Sandinista adminstration, the ways in which the revolution made them strong--and also held them back. Ironically, the 1990 defeat of the Sandinistas at the ballot box has given Sandinista women greater freedom to express their feelings and ideas.<br>
<br>
Randall interviewed outspoken women from all walks of life. The voices of these women lead us to recognize both the failed promises and continuing attraction of the Sandinista movement for women. This is a moving account of the relationship between feminism and revolution as it is expressed in the dailylives of Nicaraguan women.<br>
<br>
Margaret Randall is the author of more than fifty books, including four others about Nicaragua. She was born and raised in the U.S., but lived for twenty-three years in Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Having relinquished her citizenship when she married a Mexican, she was denied U.S. residency when she returned to the United States in 1984. After a five-year fight, she regained her citizenship in 1989. She lives in New Mexico and teaches at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, in the spring.

                        <p>""A completely new and different book from her earlier Sandino's Daughters. The core is a dozen lengthy interviews with feminist women (all but one), hence not randomly drawn from Nicaraguan society. Randall opens the volume with a useful, wide-ranging interpretative survey of history, politics, and the social situation of women. One observation that sticks: women who most resembled men in their conduct rose highest under Sandinista rule""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57.

Her works inspire others in their own creative efforts. The gentle, irascible, passionate, poetic voice of Emily Carr resonates through her writings today, even more strongly than before. Her attitudes and observations were ahead of her time on native issues, because of the important role native Northwest Coast culture played in her art and life, and on feminism, as a woman who surmounted gender prejudice to achieve her goals with such distinction. Her deep commitment to nature in all its manifestations speaks to the environmental dilemmas that face us now. Thc Emily Carr Omnibus includes all her major published works. Here are her much-loved early stories, ranging for the gentle recollections of Klee Wyck and The Book of Small, to the acerbic The House of All Sorts, as well as the lesser-known Pause and The Heart of a Peacock.

The many voices of Toni Morrison, Rigney argues, are manifested in her radical use of language, her reformulations of self and identity, her reinterpretations of history as both fact and mythology, and her images of female desire. As Rigney describes Morrison's texts, they are characterized by deliberate and meaningful silences, by the movement beyond language into music, and by representations of magic realism and the conjure world. While Morrison's fictions disrupt traditional chronologies and diffuse linearity, they also bear historical witness to the realities and brutalities of slavery, reconstruction, depression, and war - and thus, Rigney documents, they are always profoundly political. Rigney's study, like Morrison's novels, transcends traditional interpretations, maps new territory for postmodern fictions, and cultivates a common ground for a discourse on theory, race, and gender.",en,1,"Height: 8.48 Inches, Length: 5.53 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches",19.06,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/56/9780814205556.jpg,Success,110,16.6

Together, these experienced, undeterred Nicaraguan women offer powerful clues about a truly revolutionary and democratizing feminism."" --Adrienne Rich
<p>""Powerful, moving, and challenging. Everyone interested in decency and justice will want to read Sandino's Daughters Revisited."" --Blanche Wiesen Cook</p>
<p>""If it were not for writers like Margaret, how would women around the world find each other when there is such an institutional effort to keep us apart and silent? Here Margaret brings us the voice of Sandino's daughters, honoring his hat and wearing their own, wiser now, having been part of political and personal revolution."" --Holly Near</p>
<p>Sandino's Daughters, Margaret Randall's conversations with Nicaraguan women in their struggle against the dictator Somoza in 1979, brought the lives of a group of extraordinary female revolutionaries to the American and world public. The book remains a landmark. A decade later, Randall returned to interview many of the same women and others. In Sandino's Daughters Revisited, they speak of their lives during the Sandinista adminstration, the ways in which the revolution made them strong--and also held them back. Ironically, the 1990 defeat of the Sandinistas at the ballot box has given Sandinista women greater freedom to express their feelings and ideas.</p>
<p>Randall interviewed outspoken women from all walks of life. The voices of these women lead us to recognize both the failed promises and continuing attraction of the Sandinista movement for women. This is a moving account of the relationship between feminism and revolution as it is expressed in the daily lives of Nicaraguan women.</p>
<p>Margaret Randall is the author of more than fifty books, including four others about Nicaragua. She was born and raised in the U.S., but lived for twenty-three years in Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Having relinquished her citizenship when she married a Mexican, she was denied U.S. residency when she returned to the United States in 1984. After a five-year fight, she regained her citizenship in 1989. She lives in New Mexico and teaches at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, in the spring.</p>


                        <p>""A completely new and different book from her earlier Sandino's Daughters. The core is a dozen lengthy interviews with feminist women (all but one), hence not randomly drawn from Nicaraguan society. Randall opens the volume with a useful, wide-ranging interpretative survey of history, politics, and the social situation of women. One observation that sticks: women who most resembled men in their conduct rose highest under Sandinista rule""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57.

0-300-05414-9,Managing Special Education,"Fish, John",Open University Press,144,1/10/1995,,Paperback,"<p>Few playwrights write as much of their lives into every work as did Tennessee Williams, and few had lives that were so obviously theatrical. Growing up amid abusive alcoholism, genteel posturing, and the incipient madness of his beloved sister, Rose, Williams produced plays in which violence exploded into rape, castration, and even cannibalism, projecting dramatic personal traumas. In this frank, compelling study, the distinguished biographer and critic Ronald Hayman explores the intersection of biography and art in one of the most exuberantly autobiographical dramatists of the American theater. By the time he died, in 1983, Williams's reputation had seriously declined. More than twenty years of drug and alcohol addiction, coupled with devastating openness about his promiscuous homosexuality, had all but destroyed one of America's greatest playwrights, while Williams's new works were increasingly unsuccessful. In recent years, however, Broadway revivals and amateur productions have testified to his enduring greatness as one of the shapers of the American theater. The major plays, such as The Glass Menagerie, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, never disappeared from American theatrical consciousness. Their heroes - Tom Wingfield, Brick Pollitt, even Blanche Du Bois - are portraits of the artist as a very troubled man. Hayman explores the life and writings of Tennessee Williams and shows how they were linked. More than any previous biographer, he unmasks the compulsive, driven man behind the characters and lays bare the pain that engendered Williams's violent apocalypses. Tennessee Williams will change the way lovers of drama experience and understand some of its finest achievements.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Hayman ( Proust: A Biography ) analyzes the work of Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) in a study that emphasizes the extent to which Williams based his plays on the events of his life. Born into a Mississippi family with an alcoholic father and a mentally ill sister, Williams, a homosexual, subsequently found his adult relationships difficult. He conducted numerous casual affairs and abused his long-term lovers emotionally. Hayman theorizes that the disturbed and violent characters in such plays as The Glass Menagerie , A Streetcar Named Desire and other works were based on the playwright's family and friends, as well as on Williams himself. After his initial theatrical successes in the 1940s and '50s, Williams became addicted to drugs and alcohol and led a self-destructive life. Although Hayman acknowledges Williams's greatness as a writer, his portrait of the man will strike some readers as basically unsympathetic and as focusing excessively on the playwright's worst qualities.

Dependent on the inadequate funds James supplied, the women sent him detailed letters describing the family left behind. Heffernan and Stecker ( New Hampshire: Crosscurrents in Its Development ), who form these letters into a fairly continuous narrative, see the women as ``obsessed . . . with their father and convinced . . . that only a patriarchal family could provide them with security and identity,'' apparently taking these often dissembling letters at their word. In fact, these texts can challenge parental authority, as when Annie discusses James's flair for persuasion: ``I have only to hear you say black was white to be thoroughly convinced of the truth thereof.'' The editors allow only that there is ``a certain ambiguity'' in this barbed comment. Major events of the period pale in importance when compared to the household budget; when Charlotte comments on the seizure of an escaped slave, she apologizes for her interest in politics. The result is likely to appeal primarily to the serious student of the period.
