In an effort to uncover the social underpinnings of hatred based on difference, this volume challenges arguments that such traits such as intelligence or aggression are genetically determined along racial or gender lines and provides alternative accounts of the origins of racism and sexism and-most importantly-the nature and consequences of intersection.</p>
<p>Contriubutors include Beverly Greene, Gerald Horn, Ruth Hubbard, Gisela Kaplan, Lesley Rogers, and Choichiro Yatani. Simona Sharoni's ""Feminist Reflection on the Interplay of Racism and Sexism in Israel"" is representative of the level of analysis in this collection. A political scientist and an expert in conflcit analysis and resolution, Sharoni describes the intersection of racism and sexism as it effects Oriental jews, Palestinians, and Israelis, in the particular context of governmental military policies and social practices, and opens up new space for social and political change.</p>
<p>Challenging racism and sexism is blobal in scope, and hosts perspectives from a wide range of disciplines, including biology, educational studies, history, philosophy, physiology, and psychology. Essay topics include the creation of race and sex as biological categories, derivatives of racism and sexism in psychotherapy, a study of the ""rape-lynch"" controversy, and myths and realities regarding school performance of Asian and Asian-American school children.</p>

Shunned by the snobbish guardians of Manhattan society, the lively girls still attract many admirers, but no offers of marriage from eligible men - the grail pursued discreetly but with single-minded intensity by all young women of polite birth (and their mothers). Their spirited governess, Laura Testvalley, determines to launch these buccaneers in London society, whose impoverished aristocracy, groaning under the burdens of massive country estates, are only too willing to trade a title for a fortune. But the earls and lords have failed to reckon with the strong wills of the buccaneers - especially exquisite Nan's. She dares to hope for more than position and wealth: a genuine, enduring love is what she craves, and she's willing to sacrifice everything she's attained for something true and real. Edith Wharton's novel pits tradition against vitality and change in a lushly romantic tale, observed with all her characteristic elegance and wit.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Wharton's final novel (completed by Marion Mainwaring after the author's death in 1937) revolves around American and British society in the 1870s. Told in large part through the eyes of American debutantes, the story portrays innocent, wide-eyed, almost ethereal girls who turn into socially conscious women with financial worries--unrecognizable even to themselves. The beginning sections quickly catch the listener's attention, with lush descriptions of rooms, clothes, and the heights of feminine beauty. We enter a world of intrigue: secrets, characters with past relationships that could prove fatal, and competition taken to its limits. Its literary value notwithstanding, this book might appeal to soap opera and romance fans. For more attentive listeners, it quickly becomes disconcerting as more and more characters with awkward British-sounding names are added. It's increasingly difficult to recall who's who without backing up the tape.

Nancy Matthews' book explores, through a close study of six rape crisis centers in Los Angeles, how the state has influenced rape crisis work by supporting the therapeutic aspects of the anti-rape movement's agenda, and pushing feminist rape crisis centers towards convential frameworks of social service provision, while ignoring the feminist political agenda of transforming gender relations and preventing rape.<br>

Matthews is able to show us the complexity within a movement that includes radicals, moderates, women of color and lesbians working within varying frameworks, while giving the readera first-hand look at the transformation of the first grass-roots centers to the rape crisis centers of today which have come to rely on the state for organizational survival.

0-465-04450-6,"Men, Women, And Aggression","Campbell, Anne",Basic Books,208.0,1994-09-09,,Paperback,"<p>Why are men more aggressive than women? To find out, psychologist and criminologist Anne Campbell listened to the voices of ordinary men and women, as well as people for whom aggression is a central fact of life—robbers and gang members. The answer, she argues, lies not only in biology or in child rearing but in how men and women form opinions about their own aggression. Women believe their aggression results from a loss of self-control, while men see their behavior as a means of gaining control over others. Daughters are deeply ashamed when they get angry, but sons learn to associate aggression with integrity, courage, and triumph. Campbell shows how men’s and women’s different views of anger and restraint profoundly affect their actions—from rage in marriage to violence in the streets—and what this means for us all. The misreading of the meaning of aggression drives a wedge between the sexes, affecting everything from their ability to communicate with each other to the way that traditionally male-dominated spheres such as law or medicine pathologize and punish women’s aggression. The book draws together two research areas that have had little dialogue with one another—aggression and gender differences—to present for the first time a theory of their interrelationship. The book also reveals the links between criminal violence and psychological processes common to all of us. A major contribution in the tradition of <i>You Just Don’t Understand</i> and <i>In a Different Voice</i>, this book offers a new understanding of a vital issue.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.62 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches",13.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/04/9780465044504.jpg,Success,111.0,17.3

Since the initial reports of its incidence in 1981, the phenomenon of AIDS has generated a considerable literature, reflecting a wide variety of opinions as to the nature and origins of the syndrome and the appropriateness of various medical, political, and other approaches. Existing bibliographies and resource guides have tended to reflect present medical and political orthodoxies and to exclude or minimize dissenting views, whether by scientists, journalists, political activists, or people with AIDS themselves. Young fills a nuch-needed gap by providing a comprehensive guide to these important materials. Over 700 English-language items are listed. Nearly 150 books and monographs are each given up to a page or more of descriptive evaluation; a wide selection of newspaper and magazine articles, audiotapes, and periodicals is annotated more briefly. Books, monographs, and audiotapes are cross-referenced in a title index. Issues covered include activism, AZT, blood testing and screening, cultural issues and the media, experimental therapies and techniques, the HIV hypothesis, holistic therapies, intravenous and recreational drugs, long-term survivors, macrobiotics and traditional Oriental medicine, mental and spiritual aspects, origins, policies and politics, other sexually transmitted diseases, race and color, ""safe sex,"" and vitamin therapies. Four key documents from the AIDS dissident movement are appended. This bibliography will be of value to all medical, public health, and social science libraries, to collections specializing in political dissidence, and to AIDS organizations and clinics.</p>",en,,"vii, 264 p. ; 22 cm.",35.6,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/55/9780810826755.jpg,Success,93.0,17.3

They are daily reported in the media and yet most people seem to remain unmoved and uncaring. Are the media themselves responsible for this lack of care? Meanwhile, thanks to the emergence and popularity of cultural studies, the media are being studied as never before. But why is that study so often trivial and lacking in moral seriousness? Is the discipline of cultural studies part of the problem rather than, as it would have us believe, the answer? This book poses these questions and encourages reflection on why, for example, advertisements for coffee inspire more discussion than do famines. The book takes aim at the empty heart of cultural studies and argues that the study of the media can only be culturally valuable and morally worthwhile if it remembers the lessons taught by sociology. This is an accessible and controversial book which is bound to inspire debate amongst students and commentators on the media.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.43 Inches, Weight: 0.5952481074 Pounds, Width: 0.34 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/66/9780415098366.jpg,Success,121.0,17.3

Gay Ideas addresses, in diverse and often unexpected ways, how gays ought to represent themselves in the face of an increasingly threatening climate of homophobia, repression, and violence. Mohr's topics are controversial: he offers an ethical defense of outing, criticizes ACT UP for misunderstanding rights, and shows how society's treatment of gay men and lesbians has affected for the worse the general state of civil liberties in America. Covering different areas of gay life - politics, culture, and education - Mohr shows how ""gay ideas"" interact with the most entrenched American values. In one of the book's most controversial chapters, the author uses homoerotic images to espouse a model and guarantor of democracy, ultimately arguing that gays have more to offer democracy than it has offered them. He also shows how the AIDS Quilt embodies the central values of liberalism. In the final section of the book, Mohr critiques theories of the social construction of homosexuality and redeems nature as a source of beauty and wonderment for gays. Throughout Gay Ideas, Mohr affirms the importance of liberty, privacy, dignity, and individual worth in gay life. His groundbreaking arguments offer fresh insight into gay culture, American identity, democracy, and social justice.",en,Reissue,"Height: 8.5 inches, Length: 6 inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/18/9780807079218.jpg,Success,106.0,17.3

This book is a guide to the land as well as the diverse culture of women. Women's culture in Australia goes back more than 40,000 years and is a rich mosaic of story, art and music. On the top of this has come the culture of the past 200 years: from the British convicts, from China, from the Pacific, from the newer waves of migration and from the women's movement. This is reflected in literature, theatre, the visual arts, music, circuses and dance. Rural and urban women describe the places they know and love, they also describe their histories and show something of what lies behind a first impression. Contributors featured include: Oodgeroo Noonuccal, Faith Bandler, Portia Robinson, Elizabeth Jolley, Sara Dowse, Janine Haines, Dale Spender, Ruby Langford Ginibi, Kate Llewellyn, and Finola Moorhead.</p>


                        <p>Fifty-seven Australian women--including Elizabeth Jolley, Dale Spender, and Ruby Langford--offer fiction, poetry, and essays that present inside information on Australia not available in standard travel books. The volume also features descriptions of women's festivals, publications, bookstores, cafes, galleries, and more.

The result is a moving narrative that captures the complexities of girls' experiences in high school, sports, and society. It is a compelling and touching literary exploration of one group of girls' fight for success and respect... and a dramatization of the success of the women's movement and a testimony to all the changes yet to come.

She left a detailed record of her life in her letters, her published articles, her book The Passing of the Aborigines, and in notes scribbled on paper bags, old railway timetables, and even scraps of newspaper. But very little of what this strange woman tells about herself is true. For her there were no boundaries separating experience from imagination; she inhabited a world filled with events that could not have taken place, with people she had never met. In Daisy Bates in the Desert Julia Blackburn explores the ancient and desolate landscape where Mrs. Bates says she was most happy. There are meetings with the Aborigines and whites who knew her or about her, and slowly the facts of her life are allowed to emerge. But what makes this book so extraordinary is the way that, almost imperceptibly, the author fuses her own imagination and experience with that of Daisy Bates, until she seems to be recalling this other life as if it were her own, until she is able to bring us the feeling of sitting in a tent near a railway line, staring out across a red desert, where the boundary between experience and imagination disappears. This magical, absorbing new book by the acclaimed author of The Emperor's Last Island confirms Julia Blackburn as one of Britain's most original and talented writers.",en,1,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.8875 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",22.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/19/9780679420019.jpg,Success,118.0,17.3

Becky W. Thompson shows us how race, class, sexuality, and nationality can shape women's eating problems. Based on in-depth life history interviews with African-American, Latina, and lesbian women, her book chronicles the effects of racism, poverty, sexism, acculturation, and sexual abuse on women's bodies and eating patterns. A Hunger So Wide and So Deep dispels popular stereotypes of anorexia and bulimia as symptoms of vanity and underscores the risks of mislabeling what is often a way of coping with society's own disorders. By featuring the creative ways in which women have changed their unwanted eating patterns and regained trust in their bodies and appetites, Thompson offers a message of hope and empowerment that applies across race, class, and sexual preference.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.10231131 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",37.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/48/9780816624348.jpg,Success,100.0,17.3

Witty, Profound, And Forthright, They Reveal The Texture Of The Mind And History Of A Singular Twentieth-century Woman - Who Nonetheless Reminds Us Of Ourselves, Our Mothers, And Our Grandmothers. At Once Narrative, Commentary And Intellectual Autobiography, These Essays Take Some Of The Central Questions Of Human Experience And Bring To Them Answers That Are Both Personal And General. Brosman Touches Upon Topics As Varied As Higher Education, Why We Remember The Past (or, History), Ecology, Travel, Men And Women (not Versus, She Insists), Grace, And The Good Life. But She Moors Her Musings To Specific Places, People, And Events, Sharing With Us Stories Of Herself And The Individuals Who Have Influenced Her - Parents, Relatives, Lovers, Husbands, Teachers, Writers, And Philosophers. She Moves With Entertaining Ease From Abstract, Philosophical Considerations To Immediate, Pragmatic Ones. If Only One Theme May Be Attributed To This Rich Collection It Is That The Metaphysical Is Necessarily Rooted In The Physical. In Her Final Essay Brosman Recalls A Recent Camping Trip Back To The Mountains And Desert Of Her Childhood. She Writes: What I Have Had, I Believe, Is An Intimation Of Order. Notwithstanding Theories Of Physics That Emphasize Randomness, And The Strain Of Epistemological Thought That Insists That Categories Come From Us, Not From The World, I Find Order In Nature. ... I Cannot Believe That In The Order Of This Landscape There Is Not An Order Of The Spirit. Brosman - Poet, Scholar, Professor, Wife And Mother - Has A Rare Blend Of Salty Good Sense And Exalted Sensibility.

As Beigh pieces together details of Hannah's journeys, she finds herself drawn into the most intimate and spellbinding fabric of that remote life, confirming her belief that with &quot;sufficient passion and intelligence, we can decontrsuct the barriers of time and geography....&quot;</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Neither as accessible as Jasmine nor as superbly crafted as National Book Critics Circle Award-winner The Middleman and Other Stories , Mukherjee's new novel is a challenging work that engages the intellect more than the heart. Narrator Beigh Masters is a Yale grad who has put her history degree to use in ``assets research,'' tracking down rare art and jewels for wealthy clients. Her pet research project involves Hannah Easton, born in Massachusetts in 1670, who went on to marry an English trader, journey with him to India at the dawn of European colonization and become the lover of a Hindu prince. This novel is Hannah's story, told by Beigh with an emphasis on the themes that interest her: the nature of time, the merit of attempts to recapture the past, the collision of values that inevitably occurs when New World meets Old, the power wielded by unconventional women in a hidebound society and the revenge that such a society exacts. Mukherjee writes with her customary elegant lucidity; her insights into 17th-century America, England and India are as tough-minded and astute as anything she has written about contemporary society; and she spins a rousing narrative of greed, lust, battles and betrayals. Readers may feel somewhat aloof from Hannah, who is viewed always from a distance, but an abundance of interesting ideas partly compensates for the book's lack of an emotional center.

Following the oral tradition of Native American people, she reaches out to readers with a deeply personal appeal for understanding. She also records historical events from a unique perspective. She managed to record the Native American viewpoint of whites settling the West, told in a language that was not her own and by a woman during the time when even white women were not allowed to vote. Sarah Winnemucca dedicated her life to improving the living and social conditions for her people. She gave more than 400 speeches across the United States and Europe to gain support for the Paiutes.

Offering Readings From Nietzsche, Derrida, Irigaray, Kristeva, Freud And Lacan, Oliver Builds An Innovative Foundation For An Ontology Of Intersubjective Relationships That Suggests A New Approach To Ethics. Oliver Argues That While Freud, Nietzsche And Derrida, In Particular, Attempt To Open Up Philosophy To Its Other--the Unconscious, The Body, Difference, Even The Feminine--their Attempts Depend On Closing Off The Possibility Of A Specifically Feminine Other. In This Regard, Oliver Maintains That None Of These Theorists Have Escaped The Hegelian Model Of Intersubjectivity At The Level Of Lordship And Bondage. She Suggests That The Recent Talk Of The Death Of Philosophy Is A Symptom Of The Exclusion Of Woman, The Feminine And The Maternal. By Problematizing And Reformulating The Traditional Philosophical Association Between The Maternal And Nature, Oliver Presents An Alternative Model For Intersubjectivity And Ethics. -- Publisher Description.

Results show an acceptance of societal myths to create a negative image of the homosexual characters.

Joan Brock was born and raised in what she describes as a ""serpentless, California Eden."" Lithe and blithe-spirited, she had considered a career as a professional dancer. Instead she was drawn to a more challenging vocation - teaching sightless children in an Iowa school for the blind how to cope in the visible world most of us take for granted. There she fell in love with and married a colleague, and, following the birth of a daughter, life seemed ""barely short of perfect."" But one winter day when Joan was in her early thirties, fate began to turn against her - not once but twice - delivering blows that might have given most of us ample excuse to live out our years in cringing self-pity, wondering, Why me? Yet such a response would have been totally out of character for this young woman. ""Why not me?"" has been her reply, both then and now. Armed with a combination of faith, courage, and determination, Joan confronted her lot and carried on. The story of how she did so is a marvelously inspiring journey that will touch every reader. Yet More That Meets the Eye goes far beyond being just another account of triumph over tragedy. It is also a love story - one that proclaims love of life, compassion for those most in need of care, and, in a joyous ending, romantic love as tender as its telling.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",20.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/99/9780060176099.jpg,Success,109.0,17.3

Although There Has Been Little Professional Acknowledgment, It Is Apparent That Psychotherapy Is Undergoing A Fundamental Transformation Into An All-women's Field. This Volume Presents A Brilliant And Impassioned Analysis Of This Dramatic Alteration. On The Shoulders Of Women Demonstrates That The Feminization Of Psychotherapy Will Have Lasting Effects On The Theories Guiding The Work Of Psychotherapists Within The Consulting Room, Their Views Of Psychopathology And Human Development, And Even The Techniques And Goals Of Psychotherapeutic Practice. In A Provocative Discussion, This Volume Reveals The Ways The Current Paradigm Shift In Psychoanalysis - From Drive Theory To A Relational Model - Is Deeply Embedded In The Gender Recomposition Of The Field. Just As Women Represented The Other In The Traditional Freudian Paradigm, Which Had Its Roots In The Patriarchal Family Of Late Nineteenth-century Vienna And Was Practiced Largely By Men, So Now Men May Be Approaching A Similar Status Within The Emerging Relational Model.. The Author Asserts That The Implications Of The Feminization Of Psychotherapy Go Even Further, Transcending The Boundaries Of Clinical Theory And Practice Altogether. There Is Little Question That Psychotherapy Is Currently A Field In Crisis: Professional Publications Tell Of The Recent Mental Health Care Revolution, In Which Public And Private Sector Funding And Support For Both Short- And Long-term Psychotherapeutic Care Are Declining Rapidly. Ironically, While The Prestige And Financial Rewards To Be Gained In The Field Of Psychotherapy Appear To Be Decreasing, The Overall Number Of New Psychotherapists Has Grown. On The Shoulders Of Women Maintains That The Fate Of Psychotherapy And Its Increasingly Female Body Of Practitioners Speaks To Our Society's Devaluation Of Care-giving In General And Women's Identification With This Arena Of Life. Describing How The Public And Private Sectors Withdraw Support And Observe From A Distance The Single Mother, The Inner-city School Teacher, And The Woman Psychotherapist, Forcing Each To Work Under Increasingly Adverse Circumstances, The Author Demonstrates That The Responsibility For Tending To The Well-being Of Children, The Elderly, And The Mentally Ill Has Come To Rest More And More On Women's Shoulders Alone. Finally, This Volume Points Out That What Is Occurring In The Field Of Psychotherapy Reveals A Disturbing Trend That Haunts Our National Priorities, Our Collective Sense Of Social Welfare, And Our Deeply Gendered Notions Of Who Carries Out The Responsibilities Of Tending To Our Emotional Pain And Under What Conditions.. Presenting An Unerringly Accurate Analysis Of Developments That Will Have Far-reaching Consequences, The Book Is Invaluable To All Mental Health Practitioners And Those Interested In Women's Issues.

0-226-73544-3,Marguerite Yourcenar: Inventing a Life,"Savigneau, Josyane",University of Chicago Press,546.0,1993-10-01,,Hardcover,"<p>Marguerite Yourcenar was born Marguerite de Crayencour in Brussels in 1903. She lost her mother at birth, her native Belgium at the age of six, and was forced to flee her adopted France at twelve. It is little wonder that Yourcenar, whose own early past receded so quickly into personal legend, would one day describe her writing as the ""passionate reconstitution , at once detailed and free, of a moment or a man out of the past."" One of the most respected writers in the French language, best known as the author of <i>Memoirs of Hadrian</i> and <i>The Abyss</i>, she was awarded countless literary honors, culminating with her election in 1980 to the Académie Française (she was the first woman ever to be so honored). As complex, erudite, and intriguing as her work, Yourcenar's life has resisted its own passionate reconstitution until now, in part because of the writer's deliberate elusiveness, even in her autobiographical trilogy.</p>
<p>Here, in its intricate and often contradictory detail, is Marguerite Yourcenar's story, one in which loss and learning intertwined almost from the first and in which love assumed a strangely paradoxical place. Drawing on letters, diaries, and interviews with Yourcenar's friends, colleagues, and lovers, Josyane Savigneau's biography paints an intimate portrait of an artist who lived according to her own, occasionally contrary, terms: a Frenchwoman ardently in love with her native tongue, yet who lived half her life in New England; an avid seductress of women, who spent nearly forty years with one woman, yet fell in love early and late in her life with two young men; a powerful female writer whose most memorable protagonists were male, from Alexis of her first novel to the later historical characters Hadrian and Zeno. Savigneau weaves these and other contraries of Yourcenar's life into a vibrant and engrossing pattern.</p>
<p>Editor of ""<i>Le Monde</i> des Livres,"" the literary pages of France's most influential newspaper, Savigneau first met Marguerite Yourcenar on assignment in 1984. What began as a professional relationship gradually turned into a friendship. Her personal insights into that life enrich this exhaustively documented text. Following the lead set by Yourcenar in her memoir <i>Dear Departed</i>, the biographer found herself ""searching for a truth that is multiple, unstable, evasive, sometimes saddening, and at first glance scandalous but that one cannot approach without often feeling for human beings in all their frailty a certain measure of kinship and, always, a sense of pity."" Yourcenar's profound intelligence and sympathy, her foibles and obsessions, her accomplishments and trials: all are revealed here in an uncompromising portrait of an incomparable artist.</p>


                        <p>One of the most respected writers in the French language and best known as the author of Memoirs of Hadrian and The Abyss, Yourcenar received countless literary honors and became the first woman to be elected to the Academie Francaise. An uncompromising and intimate portrait. 50 halftones.

Is it possible for women to enjoy sensuality and pleasure with men that does not increase male power? Lynne Segal's unflinching examination of feminist thinking on sexuality over the past twenty-five years tackles these questions head on. Straightforward and challenging, she invites an exploration of sex in our culture—an exploration that could reverse the traditional male gaze and phallic construction of the heterosexual woman. Only two decades ago, politically aware women often declared themselves both sexual liberationists and feminists—their right to sexual fulfillment symbolized their right to selfhood. However, the most positive women's writing on female sexuality in recent years has come primarily from the lesbian community. Segal addresses the silence of heterosexual feminists on questions of sex and love and notes the shift toward sexual conservatism. She looks at the trs that followed Sixties radicalism: sex as a subversive activity, the ""liberated orgasm,"" sex advice literature, ger uncertainties, Queer politics, antipornography campaigns, the rise of the moral right. The hidden anxieties of male sexuality are also discussed. For both men and women, says Segal, our wildest dreams and worst fears are often projected onto sex. She urges an understanding of how our personal pleasures and pains remain public issues, and how a rethinking of sexual liberation could inspire a truly progressive politics for our time.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/12/9780520200012.jpg,Success,98.0,17.3

Her Basic Principle Is That Knowledge And Morality Are Generated In Collective Action, And She Develops It Through A Critical Examination Of Theories In Philosophy, Sociology And Women's Studies, Most Of Which Hide The Collective Nature And As A Result Hide The Lives And Knowledge Of Many People. At Issue Are The Questions Of What Morality Is, And How Moral Theories (whether Traditional Or Feminist) Are Implemented. Addelson Takes Up A Large Number Of Historical Cases And Contemporary Social Problems, Including Teen Pregnancy, Contraception And Abortion, And Gay Rights. These Cases Allow Her To See How The Knowledge And Lives Of Some People Are Declared Deviant Or Immoral, While Those Of Others Appear To Show The Public Consensus. One Case She Uses Throughout The Book Is Margaret Sanger's Early Work On Birth Control With The Anarcho-syndicalist Movement--a Revisionist History That Reveals Rather Than Hides The Collective Nature Of Morality And Knowledge. Addelson Shows How The Usual Individualist Philosophies Promote Theories Which Hide The Authority Of The Professionals Who Make Them. A Collectivist Approach, She Argues, Must Show The Part Professionals Play In Collective Action. Her Aim Is To Allow Professional Knowledge Makers To Be Morally And Intellectually Responsible. Based On Addelson's Twenty Years Of Work In Feminist Philosophy And Interactionist Sociology As Well As Her Long-standing Involvement In Women's Community Organization, Moral Passages Investigates How Morality And Knowledge Are Collectively Enacted In Today's World. 1.

<p>""What lingers at the end of <i>A Coin in Nine Hands</i> is the shadowiness and puppetlike vagueness of the Dictator, and the compelling specificity of the so-called 'common people' revolving all around him.""—Anne Tyler, <i>The New Republic</i></p>
<p>""Within a few pages we have met half the major characters in this haunting, brilliantly constructed novel. . . . The studied perfection, the structural intricacy and brevity remind one of Camus. Yet by comparison, Yourcenar's prose is lavish, emotional and imagistic.""—Cynthia King, <i>Houston Post</i></p>
<p>""Transcends its specific time and place to become a portrait of vividly delineated characters caught in the vise of a tragically familiar political situation.""—<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p>
<p>Best known as the author of <i>Memoirs of Hadrian</i> and <i>The Abyss,</i> Marguerite Yourcenar (1903-87) achieved countless literary honors and was the first woman ever elected to the Académie Française.</p>


                        <p>Set in Rome, where a ten lire coin passes through the hands of 9 people and becomes the symbol of contact between human beings each lost in his own passions.

Considered together, these critical views constitute a formidable challenge to traditional ways of conceptualising punishment. Yet, for all the advances made, the new critical perspectives remain deeply flawed in a significant, but as yet barely acknowledged, way - with very few exceptions they are profoundly masculinist. Punish and Critique begins the task of exploring what a theoretically-informed feminist analysis of penality might look like and, in the process, uncovers a series of disjunctions in the recent critical analyses - for example, disjunctions between 'social histories' of prison regimes on men and feminist histories of the imprisonment of women. Most crucially, the book unveils a radical disengagement between two current critical theoretical projects: masculinist studies of the emergence of punishment regimes in the context of the state's power to punish, and feminist studies, which map the differential impact of disciplinary power on lived female bodies. In Punish and Critique Adrian Howe argues that a more fully social understanding of punishment must be informed by feminist research on women's imprisonment and by poststructuralist studies of the disciplining of women's bodies. Punish and Critique will be invaluable reading to all students, lecturers and professionals in criminology, women's studies and sociology as well as to those working in prisons and the probation service.",en,1,"Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.79807338844 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches",67.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/10/9780415051910.jpg,Success,121.0,17.3

0-8147-1217-7,The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women,"Barry, Kathleen",NYU Press,1.0,1994-12-01,,Hardcover,"<p>In 1979, Kathleen Barry's landmark book, Female Sexual Slavery, pulled back the curtain on a world of abuse prostitution that shocked the world. Documenting in devastating detail the lives of street prostitutes and the international traffic in women, Barry's work was called powerful and compassionate by Adrienne Rich and a courageous and crusading book that should be read everywhere by Gloria Steinem. The Los Angeles Times found it a powerful work filled with disbelief, outrage, and documentation . . . sexual bondage shackles women as much today as it has for centuries.<br>
In The Prostitution of Sexuality, Barry assesses where we are 15 years later, how far we've come and, more importantly, how far we have still to go. Shifting her focus from the sexuality of prostitution to the prostitution of sexuality, Barry exposes the practice of teenage sexual exploitation and the flourishing Asian sex tour industry, emphasizing the world-wide role of the expanding multi-billion dollar pornography industry. The work identifies the global conditions of sexual exploitation, from sex industrialization in developing countries to te normalization of prostitution in the West. The Prostitution of Sexuality considers sexual exploitation a political condition and thus the foundation of women's subordination and the base from which discrimination against women is constructed and enacted. Breaking new ground, Barry convincingly argues for the need to integrate the struggle against sexual exploitation in prostitution into broader feminist struggles and to place it, as one of several connected issues, in the forefront of the feminist agenda.<br>
Barry concludes the book with a sampling of strategies-- international, regional, local, and personal--that feminist activists have employed successfully since the early 1980s, highlighting new international legal strategies for human rights resulting from her work.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",45.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/77/9780814712177.jpg,Success,96.0,17.3

<br>
Writing provides a valuable medium through which the voices of women artists can be heard. Although all artists' writings are important sources for analyzing the art they have produced, those by women artists have had special significance. While artists of both genders ask similar questions (such as What is an artist? Am I an artist?), women artists have often had another level to negotiate to claim their artistic vocations. In this volume, fourteen contemporary women artists articulate the personal and aesthetic issues that shape their lives and their works.<br>
<br>
Like the earlier, critically acclaimed <i>Voicing Our Visions: Writings by Women Artists</i> (Universe, 1991), which offered the writings of 19th and 20th-century women artists, much of the material in this sequel is only now made widely accessible. Each artist is introduced by a representative work of art and brief biographical sketch that examines her place in the history of art.

                        <p>Women artist, such as Barbara Kruger, Eva Hess, Mary Kelly, and Adrian Piper, give voice to the visions that shape their work. This lively collection of texts provides a clear understanding and deeper enjoyment of the work of these leading women artists. 102 illustrations.

Efronia Was Born In 1894 To A Christian Armenian Family Living In The Ottoman Empire. Though Her Father Was Brutally Murdered When She Was An Infant, His Death Was Only A Foreshadowing Of The Greater Tragedies That Would Befall The Armenian Community And Dramatically Alter The Young Girl's Life. Efronia Grew Into A Beautiful Young Woman And Was Pursued By Many Elegible Suitors. Despite Her Desires For Stability And Freedom From Her Irresponsible Brother, She Spurned Them All. But Ramzi Was Different; She Fell In Love With Him When They First Met. However, Their Passionate Feelings For Each Other Could Not Surmount The Cultural, Political, And Religious Obstacles To Their Marriage, For He Was A Persian Moslem, She An Armenian Christian. Even If There Was Some Hope That Her Family Would Eventually Consent To The Union, That Hope Was Destroyed After The Eruption Of World War I And The Massacre And Deportation Of Armenians Living Within The Ottoman Empire. For Half A Century, Efronia Told No One Of Her Secret Love For Ramzi. Only When She Was In Her Late Eighties, Living In Northern California With Her Son And His Wife, Did She Write Her Memoirs, Finally Revealing The One Love Of Her Youth, Which Never Diminished Throughout Her Lifetime. After His Mother's Death, Herant Katchadourian Translated Her Tragic Account, Discovering Much That Was New Even To Him. Stina Katchadourian Has Woven Into The Work Her Memories Of Her Mother-in-law And Provided The Historical Backdrop That Is Frighteningly Familiar In This Age Of Final Solutions And Ethnic Cleansing. The Result Is An Unforgettably Poignant And Moving Narrative. Told With Great Warmth, This Gripping Account Of A Strong And Spirited Woman Evokes A Place And Time That, Though Destroyed Forever, Will Never Be Forgotten By Armenians In Exile Throughout The World.

She discusses surgery and its options, life after mastectomy, treatment alternatives—including diet, herbs, acupuncture, manual lymph drainage, and yoga—as well as spiritual and emotional rehabilitation. She stresses the connection between the destruction of the environment and our deteriorating health. To cure the breast cancer epidemic, she insists, we must look beyond the disease and beyond our selves to heal our planet.</p>
<p>Currently, one out of every nine American women will hear the dreaded diagnosis of breast cancer at some time in her life—every twelve minutes this year a woman will die of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Despite advanced technology and early detection, incidence of the disease is actually rising while long-term survival rates are not.</p>
<p>The author points out the need to focus on prevention and political action. She shows how to start a grassroots organization, and offers advice for supporting loved ones with the disease.</p>
<p>A collection of fine art created by women recovering from breast cancer, accompanied by their own poignant commentary, highlights the text.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/80/9780892814480.jpg,Success,51.0,17.3

Opal's childhood diary, published in 1902, became an immediate bestseller, one of the most talked-about books of&nbsp;its time. Wistful, funny, and wise, it was described by an admirer as ""the revelation of the ...life of a feminine Peter Pan of the Oregon wilderness—so innocent, so intimate, so haunting, that I should not know where in all literature to look for a counterpart.""</p>
<p>But the diary soon fell into disgrace. Condemning it as an adult-written hoax, skeptics stirred a scandal that drove the book into obscurity and shattered the frail spirit of its author.</p>
<p>Discovering the diary by chance, bestselling author Benjamin Hoff set out to solve the longstanding mystery of its origin.

At the same time, it has attracted many general readers, largely because it expresses the personal, social, and intellectual crises faced by feminists during the last thirty years. In this study, Alice Templeton looks at the ways in which feminist thinking has influenced Rich's poetics while, simultaneously, her poetic practice has shaped her feminist conceptions. Templeton begins by exploring the tensions between epic, eulogistic, and lyric claims made in the poems collected in Diving into the Wreck (1973). She then examines the strategies Rich uses in subsequent collections to test and refine her feminist thinking. Templeton focuses, in particular, on the ""dialogic moments"" of cultural participation that Rich's poetry provides for the poet and the reader. These ""moments,"" Templeton argues, can dispel myths of social determinism even as they implicate readers in an ethically charged communal bond. By demonstrating the contributions that Rich has made both to feminist thinking and to our ways of reading poetic tradition, The Dream and the Dialogue treats Rich as a poet of ideas and places her work solidly in the context of contemporary literary theory.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",28.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/96/9780870498596.jpg,Success,101.0,17.3

0-226-00139-3,Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure of Health Care in Urban America,"Abraham, Laurie Kaye",The University of Chicago Press,297.0,1994-11-15,,Paperback,"<p><i>Mama Might Be Better Off Dead</i> is an unsettling, profound look at the human face of health care. Both disturbing and illuminating, it immerses readers in the lives of four generations of a poor, African-American family beset with the devastating illnesses that are all too common in America's inner-cities.</p>
<p>The story takes place in North Lawndale, a neighborhood that lies in the shadows of Chicago's Loop. Although surrounded by some of the city's finest medical facilities, North Lawndale is one of the sickest, most medically underserved communities in the country. Headed by Jackie Banes, who oversees the care of a diabetic grandmother, a husband on kidney dialysis, an ailing father, and three children, the Banes family contends with countless medical crises. From visits to emergency rooms and dialysis units, to trials with home care, to struggles for Medicaid eligibility, Abraham chronicles their access (or lack of access) to medical care.</p>
<p>Told sympathetically but without sentimentality, their story reveals an inadequate health care system that is further undermined by the direct and indirect effects of poverty. When people are poor, they become sick easily. When people are sick, their families quickly become poorer.</p>
<p>Embedded in the family narrative is a lucid analysis of the gaps, inconsistencies, and inequalities the poor face when they seek health care. This book reveals what health care policies crafted in Washington, D. C. or state capitals look like when they hit the street. It shows how Medicaid and Medicare work and don't work, the Catch-22s of hospital financing in the inner city, the racial politics of organ transplants, the failure of childhood immunization programs, the vexed issues of individual responsibility and institutional paternalism. One observer puts it this way: ""Show me the poor woman who finds a way to get everything she's entitled to in the system, and I'll show you a woman who could run General Motors.""</p>
<p>Abraham deftly weaves these themes together to make a persuasive case for health care reform while unflinchingly presenting the complexities that will make true reform as difficult as it is necessary. <i>Mama Might Be Better Off Dead</i> is a book with the power to change the way health care is understood in America. For those seeking to learn what our current system of health care promises and what it delivers, it offers a place for the debate to begin.</p>


                        <p>Describes how Medicaid &amp; Medicare works/hosp. financing in the inner city/organ transplants.

India (Marxist) in West Bengal and Shramik Sangathana in Maharashtra, this ground-breaking new work examines<br>

Investigating institutional change at the state level and protest at the village level, Amrita Basu traces the paths of two kinds of political activism among these women. With insights gleaned from extensive interviews with activists, government officials, and ordinary men and women, she finds that militancy has been fueled by pronounced sexual and class cleavages combined with potentially rancorous ethnic division.<br>

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a woman today in Italy, a country with the lowest birthrate in the world and the heaviest maternal stereotype? Does being a feminist exclude practices of cultural femininity? What are Italian women's cultural productions? These questions are at the center of this volume, which looks at how feminism and femininity are embedded in a broad spectrum of Italian cultural practices.</p>
In recent years, several books have introduced the American public to Italian women's voices. This volume goes beyond others in its range of theoretical topics and modes, considering cultural practices not only in their popular, material appearance, but also in the disciplines and forms of knowledge that order information and circumscribe behavior.<br>
<br>
The essays, all by well-known scholars in Italian studies, reflect the authors' specific critical interests in cinema, fashion, literary texts, feminist theory, and popular culture, past and present. Some address the culture of everyday life, while others examine feminism and femininity in the context of philosophy, ethics, or national identity within a global culture. Some begin with the conviction that performing ""femininity""—whether in appearance or in nurturing practices—can be culturally liberating. Others put this notion to the critical test. <br>
<br>
By situating the problem of femininity within the discussion of feminism, this volume takes on larger issues withinfeminist discourse. Its bold examination of the component of femininity within the context of women's experiences offers readers rare insight into Italian women's culture and into the multicultural possibilities of feminism.<br>

<p>The most popular citizen of Virginia has been dead for nearly 170 years. That hasn't stopped the good people of tiny Crozet, Virginia, from taking pride in every aspect of Thomas Jefferson's life. But when an archaeological dig of the slave quarters at Jefferson's home, Monticello, uncovers a shocking secret, emotions in Crozet run high—dangerously high.</p>

Mrs. Murphy and corgi Tee Tucker will stick their paws into the darker mysteries of human nature to solve murders old and new—before curiosity can kill the cat—and Harry Haristeen.</p>

It tells the story of an American woman escaping into the French language and of a scholar and teacher coming to grips with her history of learning. Kaplan begins with a distinctly American quest for an imaginary France of the intelligence. But soon her infatuation with all things French comes up against the dark, unimagined recesses of French political and cultural life.<p>The daughter of a Jewish lawyer who prosecuted Nazi war criminals at Nuremburg, Kaplan grew up in the 1960s in the Midwest. After her father's death when she was seven, French became her way of ""leaving home"" and finding herself in another language and culture. In spare, midwestern prose, by turns intimate and wry, Kaplan describes how, as a student in a Swiss boarding school and later in a junior year abroad in Bordeaux, she passionately sought the French ""r,"" attentively honed her accent, and learned the idioms of her French lover.<p>When, as a graduate student, her passion for French culture turned to the elegance and sophistication of its intellectual life, she found herself drawn to the language and style of the novelist Louis-Ferdinand Celine. At the same time she was repulsed by his anti-Semitism. At Yale in the late 70s, during the heyday of deconstruction she chose to transgress its apolitical purity and work on a subject ""that made history impossible to ignore&#58;"" French fascist intellectuals. Kaplan's discussion of the ""de Man affair"" &#8212; the discovery that her brilliant and charismatic Yale professor had written compromising articles for the pro-Nazi Belgian press&#8212;and her personal account of the paradoxes of deconstruction are among the most compelling available on this subject.<p><i>French Lessons</i> belongs in the company of Sartre's <i>Words</i> and the memoirs of Nathalie Sarraute, Annie Ernaux, and Eva Hoffman. No book so engrossingly conveys both the excitement of learning and the moral dilemmas of the intellectual life.<p></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Kaplan teaches French literature at Duke University. She traces her emotional and intellectual entanglement with French and France, teasing out the sources of her fascination in her personal history and that of her parents, and interweaving personal and critical experiences in her academic career and intellectual development.

In this collection of interviews, eighteen East German women describe the excitement, chaos, and frustration of this transitional period. The interviewees discuss candidly the problems they have faced as women in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and in the new Germany. Although the East German government proclaimed equal rights for men and women and promoted women in the dual role of worker and mother, the interviewees often take issue with those policies. The perspectives contained here are as diverse as the women who voice them. Ranging in age from twenty to sixty-nine, the women work at a variety of occupations, including filmmaker, mental health therapist, water safety instructor, university professor, housekeeper, writer, and representative to Parliament. In telling their stories, they present a wide range of experience that offers the reader a multidimensional view of life in the former GDR. The interviews challenge conventional notions about what East German women gained under socialism as well as what they lost after unification. The book shows that many women are successfully negotiating the obstacles of the transition, taking responsibility for their lives in ways that were not possible in the GDR.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Just as most every American of a certain age remembers where they were the day John Kennedy was shot, Germans will remember November 9, 1989-the day the Berlin Wall came down and borders between East and West were open for the first time in 28 years. While the media portrayed that day and the subsequent unification of Germany as overwhelmingly positive, many East Germans are not so sure that their lives are any better for it. The Wall in My Backyard collects 18 interviews with East Berlin women of various professions and backgrounds who relate their experiences before the unification and since. Many women were thrilled with the Wende (the ``turn'' or ``change'') and the first taste of freedom-intellectual, professional and physical-since childhood. Others mourned the lost stability that the GDR provided, the steady work, day care and health care. The editors write of one woman who lost her job in 1990: ``She came to realize that people developed greater self-respect when a government subsidized their employment (as had been the case in the GDR) than when it subsidized their unemployment.'' The compilation will strike a chord within women's studies circles and, with a little more editorial flair, it could have had mass appeal. But by burying some of the most tender quotes and not providing transitions within the body of the interviews, the book seems oddly unfinished. Photos.

As Murdock demonstrates in The Hero's Daughter, these exclusive relationships can be more harmful than supportive - the emotional enmeshment is so complete that the relationship is difficult to untangle. Every aspect of a woman's life is affected - from fearing commitment to recklessly choosing a mate, among a host of many other professional and personal problems. Yet, separating from a father means sacrificing the privileges of a favored daughter, a position most women wish to maintain. With revealing case studies, and through explorations of hidden truth in myths, dreams, and fairy tales, The Hero's Daughter makes clear that the rewards for this separation are great - as a woman will learn to take herself seriously, reclaim the authority she projects onto men, and establish a healthy, balanced sense of herself as a woman.                        <p>Using case studies and explorations of the hidden truth in legends, dreams, and fairy tales, The Hero's Daughter reveals the unspoken truth about daughters who identify with their fathers, rejecting the feminine within. Maureen Murdock shows that women who separate from destructive fathers will gain a healthier, more balanced sense of themselves.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",19.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/21/9780449909621.jpg,Success,104.0,17.3

Drawing on in-depth interviews and on-site observations, and using the actual words of students and teachers, the authors take the reader into the classrooms of seventeen feminist college professors at six colleges and universities - Lewis and Clark College, Wheaton College, the University of Arizona, Towson State University, Spelman College, and San Francisco State University. As these teachers integrate feminist and multicultural content into the curriculum, they demonstrate that pedagogy concerns not only ""teaching techniques"" but the whole process of the construction of knowledge in classrooms. Learning derives from relationships and interactions among teachers, students, and subject materials, not from any single perspective. In showing how the integration of feminist and multicultural content revitalizes the classroom, the book portrays innovative teaching in action. Feminist and cultural studies scholars have demonstrated that American higher education has traditionally represented the world in terms of the perspectives and achievements of a dominant minority. To educate students for a complex multicultural World, the voices of those who have been excluded need to emerge. There is widespread concern today about the quality of teaching in our colleges, particularly the predominance of lecturing and passive modes of learning. This important book presents a vision of teaching that counteracts the silence and alienation these practices engender.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",25.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/27/9780465033027.jpg,Success,111.0,17.3

If so, what would these connections be and to what degree are these prejudices reinforced or even generated by nineteenth-century science? This book explores these compelling questions by discussing two Italian authors of the late nineteenth century, a period when both antisemitism and misogyny were crucial concerns to society, as they still are today.
<p>One author, Cesare Lombroso, was a famous criminologist whose ideas about juvenile court, indeterminate sentencing, and parole still influence the American justice system. He was Jewish himself, yet wrote a book about antisemitism which blamed the Jews for their condition and proposed assimilation as an answer to the problem of prejudice. He also wrote highly derogatory work on women.</p>
<p>The other author, Matilde Serao, a well-known journalist and novelist, built a brilliant career for herself but in her newspaper editorials advised other women to stay home. In her novels she often demonstrated ambivalence and hostility towards women's condition, and she used antisemitic stereotypes in some of her work.</p>
<p><i>Antisemitism, Misogyny, and the Logic of Cultural Difference</i> demonstrates how similar is the 'logic' of these two authors' prejudice towards women and Jews, as they both depend on the science of their day, such as Darwinism, to justify their views. It raises as well the issues of why their prejudice focuses on women and Jews, since one author is Jewish and the other a woman, how prejudice towards different groups can intersect, and the role of the difficult and complex concept of self-hatred.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.87523518014 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",50.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/45/9780803223745.jpg,Success,99.0,17.3

Will I teach my daughter the right things? How do I correct the mistakes my mother made with me?
<p>Mother Daughter Revolution: From Betrayal to Power addresses all the issues that a mother guiding a budding woman could possibly need to know about. Authors Elizabeth Debold, Marie Wilson, and Idelisse Malave approach these dilemmas as would any other mother who is concerned with the survival of her daughter in a male-dominant society would. This book centers on women's attempts to build trusting relationships with their daughters. The foundation of this trust is based on removing the feeling of betrayal that develops when daughters feel that their mothers have not prepared them for the earthshaking changes they experience during adolescence. Lack of preparation for these changes leads to a lack of confidence and an inability to deal with competition.</p>
<p>Mother Daughter Revolution is written in a problem and solution style and describes the path from adolescence to womanhood through identifiable stories and anecdotes. Many mothers recount stories of being told by their mothers to ""be nice"" because ""nice girls get married and get good things."" Well, these new mothers opt to tell their daughters that being nice is not always an option, especially if ""being nice"" infringes upon their rights.</p>


                        <p>Essential reading for women of all ages, this compassionate and impassioned book looks at the astonishing phenomenon wherein young girls, initially so much more individual and self-assured than their male peers, find themselves subtly silenced--boxed in by the social standard of ""good girl"" behavior.

This is not only evident in post-communist Europe where centrally planned economies have slowly disintegrated, but also with the implementation of policies of liberalization and privatization that are currently sweeping the less developed world. While traditional theory predicts benign results from these changes, the practical outcome is less certain. Whatever its effect, it is clear that some citizens will pay a higher price than others.<p>In <b></b><b><i>Women in the Age of Economic</i></b> <b></b><b><i>Reform,</i></b> the contributors assess the impact of these dramatic structural changes upon women. Each chapter summarizes the changes that have taken place in a particular economy. This is developed further by an empirical analysis of the effect upon women. The contributors then discuss the evidence of gender bias and reach some telling, if unsurprising conclusions. Closely examining the socio-political conditions of women, they contend that regardless of the type of change involved, women suffer more in the transformation process than men do.
