return rate of 5% on purchases (excluding calendars,

discount point on all orders placed in 1996. Stores whose

Here’s what they're saying!
“Her voice is stronger, clearer and yet more gentle than ever ...” Nikki Giovanni

‘Carolina Gold’ RICE. This pot is well seasoned, rice boiled in pot liquor from greens,
tomatoes, okra, onions and bits of chicken and fish — with a lovely edge of sweetness."
Bernice Johnson Reagon
“... RICE feeds readers who are hungry for the deep love and lyricism that imbues Black life.
Nikky Finney is a writer who carries the traditions of her ancestors with the exquisite care
they deserve.” Evelyn C. White

|| THE ADVENTURES OF MONA PINSKY
by Harriet Ziskin
In this fantastical novel, a sixty-five-year-old Jewish woman
uncovers a complicated plot, faces alienation and ridicule, and
| ultimately is reborn on a heroine's journey.
One of the best, most delicate and intriguing novels it has
ever been my privilege to read. Her blend of politics and
. mysticism is completely delicious. — Judy Grahn

This fascinating account of gays and lesbians in the music industry considers the
lives of a host of performers. “A tell-all tome. . … … Pinpoints the contributions of
gay musicians throughout the century, showing how their sexuality shaped their
careers and their artistic visions. Curiously, during the Birth of the Blues, queer
noises were resounding. Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, both women of independent
means, were quite open about and in hearty pursuit of their sexuality. . . . This
engaging musical survey — which also looks at opera, avant-garde and punk —
deconstructs a century of repression and reclaims the contributions of gay
musicians for the world to see.” Publishers Weekly

issues often have a central place, although her social
commentary extends to the viciousness of the Klan

GREENER THAN GRASS
by Jennifer Fulton
When documentary filmmaker Blair Carroll comes home to the
Melbourne, Australia apartment she has borrowed for a month, she finds a
stranger, a young woman, asleep in her bed.
And so begins the story of two women of very different ages, back-
grounds, and experience.
Cassie, who works in the offices of an escort service, finds first love in a
form she never expected. And Blair . . . whose twenty-year relationship has
just come to an end.
Jennifer Fulton, says The Lesbian Review of Books, asks “universal
questions about friendship and love, intimacy and lust. The answers reflect
both depth and maturity. Girl gets girl is always popular; more inspirational
is when the girl gets to know herself.” ISBN: 1-56280-092-2 $10.95

In this new work you will come to know ten lesbian couples who have
been together from fifteen to thirty-seven years.
Some are non-white, some are Jewish, some Catholic, some are well-
educated, some not. Some have children. Five women are over seventy
years old. Some are the other’s first lover. One couple practices non-

The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many
Lives of Victoria Woodhull by Lois Beachy Underhill,
introduction by Gloria Steinem, chronicles the fasci-
nating political and personal life of Victoria Woodhull.
By the age of 34 (in 1872), she was the most famous
woman in America — it’s amazing that her name is
barely recognized today outside of feminist circles.
Besides running for president against Ulysses S. Grant
in 1872, Woodhull was also the first woman stockbro-
