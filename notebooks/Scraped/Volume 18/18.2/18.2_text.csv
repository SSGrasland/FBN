THE FEMME MYSTIQUE
Lesléa Newman, editor
A fascinating and insightful look at the world of femme identity within
the lesbian community, written by femmes, former femmes, femme
wanna-bes, femme admirers, and, of course, femmes fatales. Through
poetry, essays, short fiction, and photography, The Femme Mystique ex-
plores what it means to be a femme and a lesbian in a society that often
trivializes the feminine.

THE HADRA
Diana Rivers
This third book in Diana Rivers’s critically acclaimed series chronicles
the further adventures of the fiercely proud tribe of women, the Khal

Louise A. Blum
Maura Jaeger has hidden herself in the hills of rural Pennsylvania,
teaching English at a small state college and rigorously avoiding all rela-

ine the childhood that she has fought so hard to forget, Maura must
grant herself her own amnesty, and begin to live her life on her own terms.

Dear FBN,
Now that the Lambda Literary Awards are over,
I wanted to write thanking you for your thoughtful
Lammy piece in the May/June FBN. The item raises a
number of points that I'd like to try to address.
We've tried to make the process of administering
the awards as “neutral” as possible — not slanted
toward any particular author or point of view about
gay and lesbian life, nor toward any particular seg-
ment of the lesbian and gay publishing industry. As
we look over the books nominated by Lambda Book

busses and cabs back up for blocks on Lakeshore drive,
engendering 15-30 minute delays in disembarking.
The most dangerous situation occured Saturday
evening when the show closed and booksellers and
exhibitors left the floor and followed signs to shuttle
busses and cabs. But instead of transporation, conven-
tion goers found themselves in a nightmare that, for
some convention goers, lasted as long as two hours. A
shortage of cabs and shuttle busses resulted in lines
that snaked back into “entry” halls that were jammed
shoulder to shoulder and were fed constantly by esca-
lators pulling people off the convention floor and
dumping them into what turned into holding pens,
where exits were blocked by people waiting for busses
and cabs. People couldn't get out the way they came
in because of the flood of people who were still coming
off the floor. Eventually the entire area was so packed
with people that there was no place for people coming
off the escalators to go, and people on the escalators
were forced to “walk” up the moving escalators to
keep from landing on the people below. One woman
fell but was not seriously injured. Several people be-
came sick from breathing exhaust fumes trapped in
the entry tunnel.
It’s hard to know what is more appalling: that this
situation came into being in the first place or that
neither Reed Exhibition staff nor McCormick Place
staff were present and able to remedy the situation or
even turn off the escalators.
As I came down the escalator I heard a woman
near me whisper, “My God, what if there'sa fire?” It
was only then that I looked out and saw the crush of
people below. I was, at the moment, traveling with a
group of dykes from The Aisle. As we hit the bottom
of the escalator we still had a choice: to move forward
into the crowd, or to walk around behind the escala-
tors and go out a door there. We turned, as if with one
mind, and went out the door, to find ourselves at the
underground cab stand — where there was a line
stretching back into the morass we had just left and
very few cabs outside. We looked for sunlight and
started walking down the tunnel with no idea where
we were going. We walked until we got to open sky,
grass and and could breathe freely. Eventually we
jay-walked across ten lanes of freeway traffic and
caught cabs on the other side that took us back to the
city. It seemed to be a much safer alternative than
going back into the convention center.

standing in the hallway holding a placard, to “put
your sign down” by a McCormick Place security
guard. When she explained that she had a right to
stand peacefully and hold a sign, the security guard
grabbed it out of her hands and ripped it up. Later,

leaflets inside the lunchroom, but left when guards
told her not to leaflet there), she was told, “If you pass

Due out in July, Art on My Mind: Visual Politics
by bell hooks is thoughtful and provocative. In her
introduction hooks writes, “When I began these es-
says and conversations with individual artists, I did
not plan to focus the majority of my attention on the
work of Black women artists. The book evolved in this
direction only as I began to critically examine spaces
of lack. I found that even those Black women artists
whose work is widely acclaimed and receives atten-
tion on a number of fronts, both within the main-
stream art world and outside, rarely receive serious
consideration by art critics.” hooks interviews Alison

It seems a new psychological label is born every day. According to clinical psychologist and award-
winning author Christopher McCullough in his new book, NOBODY'S VICTIM, these labels, together
with the therapy and support groups that spawn them, are turning victimhood into America’s biggest
growth industry.
Based on the author's own practice as well as Eastern and Western philosophy, NOBODY'S VICTIM

life after victimhood, this groundbreaking book is a welcome antidote
to what really ails America, with chapters that cover:
° The allure and tyranny of victimhood
° The limitations of therapy and recovery
° Breaking free of the victim trap
° Asking the right questions
° Outgrowing “help”
° Life outside the victim cycle
“In his refreshing and insightful analysis of the proliferation of
12-step and other kinds of recovery programs, McCullough offers
self-help with a difference, which many may find liberating and
self-affirming.”-Publishers Weekly

Feminist Bookstore Sliding Scale: FBN is and has always been on a sliding scale for women’s book-
stores. Larger stores doing a higher volume of business help to subsidize FBN for small stores. The suggested range
is $225 for stores doing over $500,000, $190 or more for stores above $400,000, $165 for stores doing $350,000, $140
for stores doing $300,000, $115 for $250,000, $90 for $200,000, $70 for stores doing $100,000, $50 for stores doing
$75,000, and $20 to $55 for stores doing less than $75,000. (You decide, you know what you can afford!) Stores in ex-
treme financial difficulty: Please tell us. We'd far rather send you FBN for what you can afford than cut you off
because we haven't heard from you!
