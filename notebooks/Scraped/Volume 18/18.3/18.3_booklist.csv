0-06-251303-6,The Perfection of the Morning: An Apprenticeship in Nature,"Butala, Sharon",Harpercollins,221,1995,,Hardcover,"Through history, dream, vision and the reality of everyday life, Butala has created a rich portrait of her outer landscape - the southwest corner of Saskatchewan near the Montana border - and her inner one, the world of artistic imagination. Butala's home is one of vast grasslands and extreme climates, a territory where native bands first hunted and pioneers later attempted to settle. It is a world of farmers and ranchers who try to survive in spite of drought and cold, failing crops and isolation. It is a world as well of wildlife and endless prairie, of starlit nights and sweetsmelling grasses, where the growing writer is forced to confront not only her own solitude but her struggle to connect with the world around her. Faced with powerful visions and dreams that she at first cannot comprehend, Butala comes to understand that she can find in Nature a guiding force. What can she learn from ancient wisdom that will enable her to make this land her own? Can she ever find a place for herself in a community that is self-sufficient? Does she have the courage to turn her personal crisis both as a woman and as a writer into the stuff of fiction?",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/38/9780062513038.jpg,Success,124,18.3

Now, with While England Sleeps, available for the first time in two years, Leavitt moves beyond precisely controlled domestic drama to create a historical novel, one that has greater breadth and resonance than anything he has written before. Set against the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe, While England Sleeps tells the story of a love affair between the aristocratic young British writer Brian Botsford, who thinks homosexuality is something he will outgrow, and Edward Phelan, a sensitive and idealistic working-class employee of the London Underground and a Communist party member. When the strains of class difference, sexual taboo, and Brian's ambivalence impel Edward to volunteer to fight against Franco in Spain, Brian pursues him across Europe and into the violent chaos of war.</p>

0-253-20986-2,Rachel Calof's Story: Jewish Homesteader on the Northern Plains,"Calof, Rachel",Indiana University Press,176,9/22/1995,,Paperback,"<p>""Calof’s [story] has the ‘electricity’ one occasionally finds in primary sources. It is powerful, shocking, and primitive, with the kind of appeal primary sources often attain without effort.... it is a strong addition to the literature of women’s experience on the frontier."" —Lillian Schlissel [asking for approval to use quote]</p>
<p>In 1894, eighteen-year-old Rachel Bella Kahn travelled from Russia to the United States for an arranged marriage to Abraham Calof, an immigrant homesteader in North Dakota. Rachel Calof’s Story combines her memoir of a hard pioneering life on the prairie with scholarly essays that provide historical and cultural background and show her narrative to be both unique and a representative western tale. Her narrative is riveting and candid, laced with humor and irony.</p>
<p>The memoir, written by Rachel Bella Calof in 1936, recounts aspects of her childhood and teenage years in a Jewish community, (shtetl) in Russia, but focuses largely on her life between 1894 and 1904, when she and her husband carved out a life as homesteaders. She recalls her horror at the hardships of pioneer life—especially the crowding of many family members into the 12 x 14’ dirt-floored shanties that were their first dewllings. ""Of all the privations I knew as a homesteader,"" says Calof, ""the lack of privacy was the hardest to bear."" Money, food, and fuel were scarce, and during bitter winters, three Calof households—Abraham and Rachel with their growing children, along with his parents and a brother’s family—would pool resources and live together (with livestock) in one shanty.</p>
<p>Under harsh and primitive conditions, Rachel Bella Calof bore and raised nine children. The family withstood many dangers, including hailstorms that hammered wheat to the ground and flooded their home; droughts that reduced crops to dust; blinding snowstorms of plains winters. Through it all, however, Calof drew on a humor and resolve that is everywhere apparent in her narrative. Always striving to improve her living conditions, she made lamps from dried mud, scraps of rag, and butter; plastered the cracked wood walls of her home with clay; supplemented meagre supplies with prairie forage—wild mushrooms and garlic for a special supper, dry grass for a hot fire to bake bread. Never sentimental, Caolf’s memoir is a vital historical and personal record.</p>
<p>J. Sanford Rikoon elaborates on the history of Jewish settlement in the rural heartland and the great tide of immigration from the Russian Pale of Settlement and Eastern Europe from 1880–1910. Elizabeth Jameson examines how Calof ""writes from the interior spaces of private life, and from that vantage point, reconfigures more familiar versions of the American West."" Jameson also discusses how the Calofs adapted Jewish practices to the new contingencies of North Dakota, maintaining customs that represented the core of their Jewish identity, reconstructing their ""Jewishness"" in new circumstances.</p>",en,,"Height: 0.6 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 5.9 Inches",15,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/63/9780253209863.jpg,Success,107,18.3

The storytellers are frequently women (or were until men like Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen started writing down the women's stories), and Marina Warner asks how changing prejudices about women affect the status of fairy tales: are they sources of wisdom and moral guidance, or temptations encouraging indulgence in romantic and vengeful fantasies? From the Beast to the Blonde considers old wives' tales in all their luxuriant detail and with a strong sense of the historical contexts in which they developed. Ms. Warner's fresh new interpretations show us how the real-life themes in these famous stories evolved: rivalry and hatred between women (""Cinderella"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty""), the ways of men and marriage (""Bluebeard"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""), not to mention neglect, incest, death in childbirth, murder, and racial prejudice. As she suggests in her superb closing chapter, happy endings come only after stumbles and falls; yet in some sense the story of tale-telling is never done.

Mysticism is pervasive throughout the religions of the world, yet varies widely in its particulars. This comprehensive work surveys the mystical dimension of the world's major religions, beginning with a working description of mysticism as ""direct experience of ultimate reality,"" and examining how this understanding of mysticism holds up when set in interaction with Hindu, Buddhist, Chinese, Japanese, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions. The authors also examine the religious practices of North American, Latin American, African, and Australian native peoples, illuminating the history, principal beliefs, and teachings of each religion, and examining the lives and works of each tradition's outstanding mystics. The result is a dialogue between the particulars of mystical experience, which vary from tradition to tradition, and the generalities they share which make it possible to discuss mysticism across these traditions. This accessibly written introduction will appeal to students of mysticism, readers seeking mystical experience, and all those interested in religion as practiced throughout the world.",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",35,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/82/9780195088182.jpg,Success,105,18.3

It is the variety of the representations of women--as gods, Madonnas, witches, and so on--that we hope to capture, in its permanence as well as its many transformations."" Informed by the work of seventy-five distinguished historians, this five-volume series sets before us an engaging, panoramic chronicle that extends from antiquity to the present day. The inaugural volume brings women from the margins of ancient history into the fore. The authors' deft analysis offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. In the minds of the ancients, the roles for which women were destined were silent ones: motherhood and homemaking, tasks relegated to obscurity by scribes who focused exclusively on the deeds of men. Even the census neglected women; in Rome, only heiresses were counted. But the dearth of information about women in official archives and the near absence of writing by women from this era stand in stark contrast to the astonishing profusion of texts and images created by men that are concerned with women and gender. The number of women's representations is astonishing. The authors draw upon sources ranging from gravestones to floor plans, from stele inscriptions to papyrus rolls, from vase paintings to Greek and Roman literary works, to illustrate how representations of women evolved during this age. They journey into the minds of men--from the Greeks imagining their goddesses to the Church Fathers inventing the figure of the martyred female saint--and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes. The authors explore select aspects o

In a ""continuous thread of revelation"" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection&#58; the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.<P>Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South&#151;of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught&#151;would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who loves good writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity.</p><h3>William Maxwell - New Yorker</h3><p>In these lectures, thoughtful attention is given to a great many experiences...It is all wonderful...The parts of the book that are about her family...are by turns hilarious and affecting.

In eleven linked stories, Norman Wong observes the fragile world of the resilient Lau family through the eyes of their &quot;number one son,&quot; Michael, who must bear the weight of the family name while hiding his desire for white men. Bold and evocative, Cultural Revolution heralds the arrival of a major new voice in American fiction.<br>&quot;A MOVING COLLECTION by a gifted new writer with the wit and sympathy to make four generations of family experience all sound like his own...[Cultural Revolution] recalls a number of fine debut volumes from writers like Maxine Hong Kingston, Gish Jen, Cynthia Kadohata, and David Wong Louie.&quot;<br>&#151;The Village Voice<br>&quot;COMPELLING...COMPASSIONATE...Wong has a strong, distinct, storyteller's voice, he has a vision, and a real point of view.&quot;<br>&#151;Hungry Mind Review<br>&quot;A UNIQUE VIEW of a world that is both distant and remarkably close to our own.

A woman's reluctant journey from mainland China to Hong Kong as she escapes the invading Japanese frames the brief, absorbing opening section, ``Mai Wah.'' Dreams shape several stories in the second section, in which Mai Wah's grown grandson, Wei, and his family adapt to their new lives in Honolulu. In ``A Nice Chinese Girl,'' Wei dreams of owning a car in order to properly date Marie, who dreams of owning a restaurant; in ``Open House,'' Wei's cousins dream of buying a new home in the suburbs. The best stories deal with Michael, Wei's son, inching toward accepting his homosexuality. In ``The Chinese Barber,'' Michael develops an infatuation with an American boy he meets at a mall; in ``Ordinary Chinese People,'' he attempts suicide, distraught over the inattentiveness of his track coach. Irony fuels the final section, ``Cultural Revolution,'' in which Wei returns to China to retrace his grandmother's escape for Michael, who now eschews everything Chinese. Wong's choppy prose works well in conveying his characters' difficulty with English, but it robs these finely crafted stories of rich detail and prevents them from achieving the lyrical moments the material suggests.

[Hughes] is sumptuous and sharp, playful and sparse, grounded in an earthy music&#151;. This book is a glorious revelation.&quot;&#151;Boston Globe<P>Spanning five decades and comprising 868 poems (nearly 300 of which have never before appeared in book form), this magnificent volume is the definitive sampling of a writer who has been called the poet laureate of African America&#151;and perhaps our greatest popular poet since Walt Whitman.&#160;&#160;Here, for the first time, are all the poems that Langston Hughes published during his lifetime, arranged in the general order in which he wrote them and annotated by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel.<P>Alongside such famous works as &quot;The Negro Speaks of Rivers&quot; and Montage of a Dream Deferred, <b>The Collected Poems</b> includes the author's lesser-known verse for children; topical poems distributed through the Associated Negro Press; and poems such as &quot;Goodbye Christ&quot; that were once suppressed.&#160;&#160;Lyrical and pungent, passionate and polemical, the result is a treasure of a book, the essential collection of a poet whose words have entered our common language.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>At last Hughes has gotten his first collected edition; it is overdue. The editors have attempted to collect every poem (860 in all) published by the writer in his lifetime, and have also provided a brief but informative introduction, a detailed chronology and extensive textual notes that include the original date and place of publication for each poem. In fact, this edition corrects the many errors and omissions of the standard Hughes bibliography, and the editors plan to update the text as more unpublished work surfaces. Although Hughes is best known for his poems celebrating African African life, he was also a passionately political poet who paid dearly for his communist affiliations and radical views. The chronological arrangement of the poems allows the reader to follow the course of Hughes's career-long political engagement, though probably Hughes will mainly be read for the clarity of his language, his wise humor and his insight into the human condition.

<p>Twenty thousand years ago, women were making and wearing the first clothing created from spun fibers. In fact, right up to the Industrial Revolution the fiber arts were an enormous economic force, belonging primarily to women.</p>
<p>Despite the great toil required in making cloth and clothing, most books on ancient history and economics have no information on them. Much of this gap results from the extreme perishability of what women produced, but it seems clear that until now descriptions of prehistoric and early historic cultures have omitted virtually half the picture.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Wayland Barber has drawn from data gathered by the most sophisticated new archaeological methods—methods she herself helped to fashion. In a ""brilliantly original book"" (Katha Pollitt, <b>Washington Post Book World</b>), she argues that women were a powerful economic force in the ancient world, with their own industry: fabric.</p>


                        <p>New discoveries about the textile arts reveal women's unexpectedly influential role in ancient societies. Barber ""weaves the strands of mythology and literature, archaeology, ethnology, and documented history into a rich tapestry"" says John Noble Wilford, New York Times Book Review.

There are insights from experts from New York's Hetrick-Martin institute, Los Angeles's Project 10, and Minneapolis's District 202 Teen Center, as well as the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, P-FLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and the American Psychiatric Association. Their findings are often sobering: A 1986 study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on Youth Suicide stated that ""gay youth are 2 to 3 times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people."" The National Advocacy Coalition on Youth and Sexual Orientation found that 86 percent of secondary-school students said they would be upset if they were labeled gay or lesbian. The Seattle Commission for Lesbians and Gays reported that 75 percent of those surveyed had been physically or verbally assaulted.

The characters-as many men as women come alive on these pages-enjoy good fortune and suffer pain in a tradtional African manner: through brilliant, witty, defiant, image-laden speech. The style of these stories renders African orality dramatically; characterization emerges as much through the unique voice as through physical appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special strength of these stories lies in Aidoo's sensitivity to men's as well as women's lives. Sometimes one can feel even more compassion for the men who are often set in ways counter-productive to living in an African-controlled but tightly-hierarchical society. Even the most critical consciousness-the Western-educated African living abroad or returning home-sometimes doesn't ""get it,"" for the changes are too vast, the future too uncharted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title story suggests more than meets the eye. If there is no ""sweetness,"" there is the salt essential to life, even if it comes from tears, and the strength that comes from a history of endurance. There is also the wit of the word and the compassion of family and friends. The volume is at once entertaining and deeply instructive not only about a changing Africa, but about such universal themes as love, marriage, work, family, sacrifice, privilege, and hierarchy.</p>",en,48886th,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.4960400895 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/91/9781558611191.jpg,Success,72,18.3

Graham and her co- authors argue that women bond with men and adopt men's perspective in an effort to escape the threat of men's violence against them.<p> <p>Dee Graham's announcement, in 1991, of her research on male-female bonding was immediately followed by a national firestorm of media interest. Her startling and provocative conclusion was covered in dozens of national newspapers and heatedly debated. In <I>Loving to Survive</I>, Graham provides us with a complete account of her remarkable insights into relationships between men and women.<p> <p>In 1973, three women and one man were held hostage in one of the largest banks in Stockholm by two ex-convicts. These two men threatened their lives, but also showed them kindness. Over the course of the long ordeal, the hostages came to identify with their captors, developing an emotional bond with them. They began to perceive the police, their prospective liberators, as their enemies, and their captors as their friends, as a source of security. This seemingly bizarre reaction to captivity, in which the hostages and captors mutually bond to one another, has been documented in other cases as well, and has become widely knownas Stockholm Syndrome.<p> <p>The authors of this book take this syndrome as their starting point to develop a new way of looking at male-female relationships. <I>Loving to Survive</I> considers men's violence against women as crucial to understanding women's current psychology. Men's violence creates ever-present, and therefore often unrecognized, terror in women. This terror is often experienced as a fear for any woman of rape by any man or as a fear of making any man angry. They propose that women's current psychology is actually a psychology of women under conditions of captivitythat is, under conditions of terror caused by male violence against women. Therefore, women's responses to men, and to male violence, resemble hostages' responses to captors. <p> <p><I>Loving to Survive</I> explores women's bonding to men as it relates to men's violence against women. It proposes that, like hostages who work to placate their captors lest they kill them, women work to please men, and from this springs women's femininity. Femininity describes a set of behaviors that please men because they communicate a woman's acceptance of her subordinate status. Thus, feminine behaviors are, in essence, survival strategies. Like hostages who bond to their captors, women bond to men in an effort to survive. <p> <p>This is a book that will forever change the way we look at male-female relationships and women's lives.<p></p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.13097140406 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/91/9780814730591.jpg,Success,109,18.3
0-8165-1565-4,Gender and Agricultural Development: Surveying the Field (Studies in Industry and Society; 8),,University of Arizona Press,161,9/1/1995,"Women & Employment, Women & Politics, Agricultural Labor, Development",Paperback,"<p>Agricultural planning and development are crucial to human survival, but they usually proceed without any consideration of the importance of gender issues at the production level. Although women have long been prime movers in agriculture, their contribution to the world's food supply has been largely ignored, and consequently their stake in development has been undermined. This book is both a resource guide and a review of major issues in gender and agriculture which demonstrates that recognizing the contribution of women to agricultural production is a necessary step in development planning. It presents relevant information and research literature regarding women's roles in agriculture in a consolidated and accessible format, offering insights into how the inclusion or exclusion of appropriate information at the planning stage can have an impact during implementation. It also provides guidelines for locating information on gender-related agricultural issues and incorporating it into development planning, research, and training. The literature reviewed not only calls attention to the work women do in order to improve their access to technology and training but also challenges existing development paradigms. The issues discussed present women's experiences and local knowledge and allude to gender and class inequities that farming women face. Each chapter is intended to help the reader address major gender issues in a specific subject in order to access relevant information and thereby better design and implement appropriate agricultural planning and policies. By synthesizing twenty years of international research, <i>Gender and Agricultural Development</i> provides an effective tool for development practitioners to use in training programs or surveys in order to ensure the appropriate collection of gender disaggregated data and for educators to integrate gender issues into courses dealing with social aspects of agricultural systems. Its findings are presented in such a way as to allow them to be easily incorporated into innovative planning for more sustainable and equitable agricultural policies.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.36 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/53/9780816515653.jpg,Success,112,18.3

1-57322-512-6,Prozac Nation,"Wurtzel, Elizabeth",Riverhead Books,368,10/1/1995,,Paperback,"<p>Full of promise is how anyone would have described Elizabeth Wurtzel at age ten, a bright-eyed little girl who painted, wrote stories, and excelled in every way. By twelve she was cutting her legs in the girls' bathroom and listening to scratchy recordings of the Velvet Underground. College was marked by a series of breakdowns, suicide attempts, and hospitalizations before she was finally given Prozac in combination with other psychoactive drugs, all of which have worked sporadically as Elizabeth's mood swings rise and fall like the lines of a sad ballad. This memoir, both harrowing and hilarious, gives voice to the high incidence of depression - especially among America's youth. Prozac Nation is a collective cry for help, a generational status report on today's young people, who have come of age fully entrenched in the culture of divorce, economic instability, and AIDS. ""This private world of loony bins and weird people which I always felt I occupied and hid in,"" writes Elizabeth, ""had suddenly turned inside out so that it seemed like this was one big Prozac Nation, one big mess of malaise. Perhaps the next time half a million people gather for a protest march on the White House green it will not be for abortion rights or gay liberation, but because we're all so bummed out."" Writing with a vengeance (Nirvana, Joni Mitchell, and Dorothy Parker all rolled into one), Elizabeth Wurtzel will not go gentle into that good night. She wants off medication, she wants a family, and most definitely, a life worth living.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Twenty-six-year-old Wurtzel, a former critic of popular music for New York and the New Yorker, recounts in this luridly intimate memoir the 10 years of chronic, debilitating depression that preceded her treatment with Prozac in 1990. After her parents' acrimonious divorce, Wurtzel was raised by her mother on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The onset of puberty, she recalls, also marked the onset of recurrent bouts of acute depression, sending her spiraling into episodes of catatonic despair, masochism and hysterical crying. Here she unsparingly details her therapists, hospitalizations, binges of sex and drug use and the paralyzing spells of depression which afflicted her in high school and as a Harvard undergraduate and culminated in a suicide attempt and ultimate diagnosis of atypical depression, a severe, episodic psychological disorder. The title is misleading, for Wurtzel skimps on sociological analysis and remains too self-involved to justify her contention that depression is endemic to her generation. By turns emotionally powerful and tiresomely solipsistic, her book straddles the line between an absorbing self-portrait and a coy bid for public attention.

Ann Zwinger's is that of a naturalist, an ""observer at the river's brim."" Teamed with scientists and other volunteer naturalists, Zwinger was part of an ongoing study of change along the Colorado. In all seasons and all weathers, in almost every kind of craft that goes down the waves, she returned to the Grand Canyon again and again to explore, look, and listen. From the thrill of running the rapids to the wonder in a grain of sand, her words take the reader down 280 miles of the ""ever-flowing, energetic, whooping and hollering, galloping"" river. Zwinger's book begins with a bald eagle count at Nankoweap Creek in January and ends with a subzero, snowy walk out of the canyon at winter solstice. Between are the delights of spring in side canyons, the benediction of rain on a summer beach, and the chill that comes off limestone walls in November. Her eye for detail catches the enchantment of small things played against the immensity of the river: the gatling-gun love song of tree frogs; the fragile beauty of an evening primrose; ravens ""always in close attendance, like lugubrious, sharp-eyed, nineteenth-century undertakers""; and a golden eagle chasing a trout ""with wings akimbo like a cleaning lady after a cockroach."" As she travels downstream, Zwinger follows others in history who have risked—and occasionally lost—their lives on the Colorado. Hiking in narrow canyons, she finds cliff dwellings and broken pottery of prehistoric Indians. Rounding a bend or running a rapid, she remembers the triumphs and tragedies of early explorers and pioneers. She describes the changes that have come with putting a big dam on a big river and how the dam has affected the riverine flora and fauna as well as the rapids and their future. Science in the hands of a poet, this captivating book is for armchair travelers who may never see the grandiose Colorado and for those who have run it wisely and well. Like the author, readers will find themselves bewitched by the color and flow of the river, and enticed by what's around the next bend. With her, they will find its rhythms still in the mind, long after the splash and spray and pound are gone.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.25443027078 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/61/9780816515561.jpg,Success,112,18.3

The reality is more sobering. In <i>Divided Sisters</i>, Midge Wilson and Kathy Russell, the acclaimed authors of <i>The Color Complex</i>, tackle the nature of relationships between black and white women, and explore how they do, and don't, get along.<br>
<br>
Based on scores of interviews, cultural literature and extensive research, <i>Divided Sisters</i> examines relations between black and white women as children, as adults, at school and in college, at work and at home. Truthfully as adults relatively few women feel they are close friends with a woman from another racial background. The book exposes many of the challenges and obstacles that complicate interracial relationships in a society with a long history of racial inequality. What Midge and Kathy discover is that the concerns and frustrations of black and white women are often different, and that these differences are frequently not communicated. For example, women thrown together for the first time in college are often ill-prepared to handle cultural differences in dress, customs, attitudes and background. In addition, peer pressure, economic and historical inequality, real or perceived racism, and fear, play a role in dividing rather than uniting women.<br>

Not many novels,"" says Lessing in her first chapter of what is destined to be one of the best autobiographies of our time. Although Lessing has incorporated her life into nearly all of her novels, most notably the Martha Quest series, and has published some short autobiographical sketches, this is her first full-length autobiography, with a second volume projected to cover 1950 onward. From her childhood in the wilds of what was then Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) through her young married life in Salisbury to her Communist years during World War II, Lessing is able both to capture the immediacy of her youthful feelings and to comment on her past self with both compassion and the distance that maturity brings. This is a wonderfully vivid memoir that reveals the origins of a remarkable writer. It also gives the reader a direct connection to the physical and emotional experiences of childhood and youth that are universal and timeless.

Dykes, Jr., Oakland University</I><p>From the introduction&#58;<BR> This book was put together to reclaim, and to create heightened awareness about, individuals, contributions, and struggles that have made African-American survival and progress possible. We cannot accurately comprehend either our hidden potential or the full range of problems that besiege us until we know about the successful struggles that generations of foremothers waged against virtually insurmountable obstacles. We can, and will, chart a coherent future and win essential opportunities with a clear understanding of the past in all its pain and glory.</p><p>Here, in a single volume, is a sweeping panorama of black women's experience throughout history and across classes and continents. Containing over 30 crucial essays by the most influential and prominent scholars in the field, including Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Linda Gordon, and Nell Irvin Painter, <B>We Specialize in the Wholly Impossible</B> is a comprehensive assessment of black women's lives. <p>The book is divided into six sections&#58; theory; Africa; the Caribbean and Canada; 18th-century United States; 19th-century United States; and 20th-century United States. A remarkably diverse range of topics are covered, with chapters on such subjects as working-class consciousness among Afro-American women; the impact of slavery on family structure; black women missionaries in South Africa; slavery, sharecropping, and sexual inequality; black women during the American Revolution; imprisoned black women in the American West; women's welfare activism; SNCC and black women's activism; andproperty-owning free African-American women in the 19th-century South. </p><br></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Similar in format to the other volumes of the series, this book is a collection of 32 scholarly articles, most reprinted from journals since 1989. The first dozen articles address theory in black women's history and black women in Africa, Canada, and the Caribbean, while the bulk of the essays concentrates on black women in 18th-through 20th-century American history. The quotation in the title was a motto of a training school for black women. Hine also edited the well-received Black Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia (LJ 2/15/93).

Drawing upon his own experience as a clinical psychologist and a decade-long involvement with AIDS/HIV issues, Walt Odets explores the largely unrecognized matters of denial, depression, and identity that mark the experience of uninfected gay men.<br>Odets calls attention to the dire need to address issues that are affecting HIV-negative individuals-from concerns about sexuality and relations with those who are HIV-positive to universal questions about the nature and meaning of survival in the midst of disease. He argues that such action, while explicitly not directing attention away from the needs of those with AIDS, is essential to the human and biological well-being of gay communities. In the immensely powerful firsthand words of gay men living in a semiprivate holocaust, the need for a broader, compassionate approach to <i>all</i> of the AIDS epidemicâs victims becomes clear. <i>In the Shadow of the Epidemic</i> is a pathbreaking first step toward meeting that need.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.23 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/81/9780822316381.jpg,Success,45,18.3

The Empress has 300 aliens crammed into her belly - all are victims of the Asian slave trade, and all are paying very handsome fees for these luxurious accommodations to Kao Lee, Chinatown's notorious crime lord and leader of the feared Chi Who gang. But Kao's worried because his astrologer has cautioned him that Jupiter is on the rise, that danger is on its way and will come with the water. What Kao Lee doesn't know is that trouble's already on board and it goes by the name Pharoah Love. Gay, black, and always proud, with his earring and ponytail, Pharoah Love is unlike any other New York City homicide detective - past, present, and, probably, future. Now it's Love versus Lee, and things don't look good for the sassy detective. His boss, Lieutenant Lombardo, suspects that one of his men is in Kao's pocket. Pharoah's best snitch has been killed with a deadly Oriental poison, and his only clue is a very queer kind of umbrella indeed. But the stars say that Kao's days are numbered, and Pharoah is the worthy adversary who plans to fulfill this prophecy.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/64/9780684814964.jpg,Success,140,18.3

0-684-80160-4,Serpent's Gift,"Lee, Helen Elaine",Scribner,384,10/1/1995,,Paperback,"<p>One of the most striking and heartening developments in American letters in recent years has been the flowering and attendant celebration of African-American writers and of books that have introduced to readers everywhere people, situations, and events that have, hitherto, largely been ignored, denied, or unknown. Now comes Helen Elaine Lee's supremely assured <i>The Serpent's Gift,</i> a first novel that gives to us — with the fullest emotional resonance, humor, and exultation in the novelist's art — the intertwined stories of two families from early in this century to our own times.</p>
<p>Central to this haunting (and sometimes haunted) novel are the mothers, a study in contrast in strength and rigidity, Ruby Staples and Eula Smalls, and their children: LaRue Smalls, adventurer, storyteller, and chronicler of his people; his sister Vesta, intimidated by life from an early age, yet determined, valiant even, to hold her disparate family together; and Ouida Staples, a rare beauty who elects, in the face of convention, to spend her life with another woman. Each will face trials and challenges and sometimes be transformed, shedding like the serpent, an old skin, reborn by the art of invention.</p>
<p> From its opening pages, which recount in eerily compelling detail, the death that will bring these people together, to its almost pastoral conclusion, <i>The Serpent's Gift</i> creates a world that is both realistic in its detail and lyrical in its presentation — it is a superb, triumphant debut.</p>


                        <p>A lyrical, multigenerational story about two African-American families, written by a writer who captivates in the tradition of Toni Morrison and Gloria Naylor. Tracing the lives of the highly memorable matriarchs of the Staples and Smalls families over nearly a century, Lee creates a world that is starkly real and magically haunting.

And as Karim renews contact with his family and surveys the misery and needs of his war-torn country, he begins to question where he can best achieve his ideals.<P>In sensuous and elegant prose, Rachlin weaves the interlinking stories of a man and a woman and their contrasting cultures with balance and sympathy.<P>Nahid Rachlin is an Iranian who lives in New York City, where she teaches creative writing at Barnard College. She is author of Veils&#58; Short Stories and Married to a Stranger (both published by City Lights) and Foreigner (W. W. Norton).</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Rachlin (Veils) tries not to judge anyone in this story of an American woman married to an Iranian mantact that may be admirable in life but that makes for a somewhat bland novel. Artist Jennifer and professor Karim leave their comfortable home in Athens, Ohio, with their six-year-old son, Darius, to visit Karim's family shortly after the end of the Iran-Iraq war. An accomplished Farsi speaker, Jennifer remains intrigued by Teheran on her second visit but finds it much changed, with an anti-Americanism that makes her uncomfortable. At the same time, Karim's recollections of growing anti-Iranian feeling in the United States are weighing on him. Jennifer's and Karim's relationship has been strained of late anyway, as after 12 years together, he seems to be rediscovering his ethnicity. While in Iran he gets word that his department head back home has given away one of his courses, and he begins to toy with the idea of remaining in Iran. Trouble erupts when Karim leaves on a short trip with his uncle and Karim's mother kidnaps Darius in order to enroll him in religious school. One can learn a lot from this novel, but while these observations are interesting, many (particularly on Jennifer's part) have the feel of pedagogical exposition rather than narrative necessity.

On A Fishing Trip In Northern Minnesota, She Recalls Her Troubled Older Sister's Death At 22 From An Overdose Of Antidepressants; On Another Trip, She Works Up The Courage To Tell Her Husband That She Is Leaving Him And That She Is Attracted To Women. Although Consistently Insightful, These Essays Occasionally Ramble A Little Too Far And Wide. For Example, An Examination Of Gender-defined Clothing And Accessories Struggles To Contain References Both To A Catalogue Of Sensual Devices And To Diana, Goddess Of The Hunt; And The Latter, Like Legler's Other Classical References And Quotes, Seems Forced. Still, These Rare Disjointed Moments Are Clearly The Result Of The Experimentation And Openness That Infuse This Book With Realism And Wisdom.

We meet her grandparents and her parents, who plant corn and worship their gods much as their own grandparents did. We meet her husband and her children, whose lives straddle two worlds - ancient and modern, sacred and profane. As their stories unfold, we come to appreciate the Navajo society into which Ella was born - still in the 1950s an almost nineteenth-century world of visions and spirits, a world ordered by the unambiguous demands of religious tradition and ritual. We see that now, because of the genius of the Navajo culture for incorporating change, it is a world in which the established has made room for the new while at the same time maintaining its unique bond with the past.

                        <p>The moving account of an Indian woman and her family as she moves from the traditional life of the Navajo reservation into the white world. Ella Bedonie points the way toward comprehending both the difficulties her children will face as they increasingly inhabit the white world, and the many strengths they have to offer that world.

Inspired by activist and writer Rebecca Walker, they speak out, challenging many of their assumptions about the women's movement and demanding that readers recognize a new relationship between the personal and the political. Black and white, male and female, gay and straight, they fearlessly describe their liberation from the feminist ""ideals"" that conflict with the reality of who they are, expose ""shocking"" secrets, and acknowledge long-hidden accommodations and anomalies. Controversial and provocative, To Be Real is a blueprint for the creation of a new political force.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Edited and introduced by Walker, journalist, Ms. editor, and coauthor of House and Home: Spirits of the South (Univ. of Washington Pr., 1994), this anthology adds to the growing body of work by and about younger feminists.

Other topics include sex in cyberspace, women and aggression, the politics of taking names, feminist hip-hop, how to hold a nonsexist stag party, and the trials of an aspiring corporate attorney.

Chronicling the lives of women from low-income communities who have been physically battered, sexually assaulted, emotionally abused, and involved in illegal activity, the book illustrates the degree to which these women's devastated and deteriorating circumstances represents a socially constructed position--but one from which there is little escape.<br>
<br>
Borrowing the phrase ""gender entrapment"" from the legal notion of the term--which implies a circumstance whereby an individual is lured into a compromising act--author Beth Richie uses gender entrapment to describe the process whereby African American women who are vulnerable to men's violence in their intimate relationships are penalized for criminal behaviors they engage in when these behaviors are logical extensions of their racialized gender identities, their culturally mediated gender roles, and the violence in their private lives.<br>
<br>
The book documents in graphic detail the lives of these women--often marred by drug use, prostitution, and violence culminating in illegal activity. Richie charts the women's gender entrapment by considering a number of factors in their early lives--whether the women were privileged in their homes as girls and how such benefits actually might have handicapped them; their relationships with males; the presence or absence of childhood abuse--and how these factors contributed to their sense of vulnerability and fear of success later in life. Richie then analyzes how the women's circumstantial and emotional vulnerability in the early years sets the stage for theviolence in their intimate relationships with men as adults, and how the women's feelings of self-blame, emotional trauma, and desperation lead them--perhaps inexorably--into illegal, often violent activity.<br>
<br>
<i>Compelled to Crime</i> also gives special consideration to the complicated set of reasons why some low income African American battered women resort to illegal activity. By contrasting their experiences with two smaller comparison groups, Richie offers important methodological and analytical contributions to the scholarship on gender, race, violence, and crime. In reaching her conclusions, Richie makes the disturbing point that in the end because these women are involved in illegal activity and hence labelled ""criminal,"" they did not have access to services for battered women, sexual assault survivors, or other crime victims.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 5.98 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.46 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/50/9780415911450.jpg,Success,138,18.3

But not long ago, being serious about sport was considered appropriate only for men and boys. Throughout the twentieth century, women's increasing participation in sport has challenged our conception of womanhood. Some celebrated the female athlete as the embodiment of modern womanhood, but others branded her mannish or lesbian. Ultimately, she altered the perception of sport as an exclusively male domain.</p><p>Susan Cahn's story of how sport has changed women's lives and women have transformed sport is an important chapter in the wider history of women's struggles to define their role in the twentieth century. For the women who dared to compete, participation in sport enabled them to expand the boundaries of women's activities and to claim that strength, skill, physicality, and competitiveness could be authentic attributes of womanhood. This is the legacy they passed on to the new generation of women for whom athleticism is becoming a way of life.</p>                        <p>Drawing on historical records and contemporary interviews, Cahn chronicles the remarkable transformation made by women's sports in the the 20th century, revealing the struggles faced by women to overcome social constraints and behavior codes, and how sport has changes their lives.

How did Hill's allegations leak to the press? Why was the Senate Judiciary Committee unable to solve the mysteries surrounding the case? But as Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson show, the story of Thomas's ascension to the Court goes far beyond what emerged during the hearings. Over the course of their investigation, the authors conducted hundreds of interviews - including the first on-the-record interview with Anita Hill about her role in the controversy - and uncovered many documents that were never shared with the public. For the first time, we learn about Thomas's ten-year campaign for the high court and the doubts about him that haunted the White House from the start. We see the profound cynicism behind the administration's campaign for Thomas: its canny manipulation of the weak and scandal-ridden Senate, its quiet collaboration with the religious right, its calculated creation of ""grassroots"" black support. In the end, we learn the truth about who Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill really are and how both were treated unfairly by Washington's establishment.",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/90/9780452274990.jpg,Success,130,18.3

Yet, While Such Conversations Have Focused Primarily On Gender And The Traits Of Masculinity, Little Attention Has Been Paid To Male Sexuality Itself Or To The Problems It Engenders For Men. Eilberg-schwartz Here Opens That Issue, Contending That Making God In A Man's Sexual Image Either Requires The Feminization Of The Man Or Implies A Homoerotic Relationship Between Father And Son. Through A Detailed Study Of The Hebrew Bible, The Talmud And Freud, The Author Demonstrates The Tensions Latent In Any Tradition Within Which Men Must Engage The Image Of God's Phallus. Eilberg-schwartz Brings To This Study A Rich Experience Of Writing About Both The Body And Judaism, And Readers Will Be Greatly Rewarded By His Careful Scholarship And Crisp Writing. While The Book Challenges Feminist Assertions About Gender And Religion, It Is A Significant Contribution To The Ongoing Conversation About The Centrality Of Sexuality To Religion.

In Her Intriguing And Provocative Book About Females And Sex, Small Concentrates On Primates - The Prosimians, Monkeys, And Apes, Whose Ancestry We Share - To Show How Females Have Evolved To Be Highly Sexual Creatures. Using Nonhuman Female Primates As A Gauge, She Describes The Sexual And Reproductive Strategies Of Our Nearest Cousins To Demonstrate That Just As Males Are Strategists In The Reproductive Game, Females Also Search For Good Partners, Enjoy Sex, And Keep Their Own Reproductive Interests In Mind. Female Choices Opens With The Evolution Of Sexual Reproduction And Of Males And Females As Distinct Forms. Small Then Introduces Primates And Gives A Detailed History Of The Average Female's Life Cycle. After Devoting Chapters To Sexuality, Reproduction, And Sexual Selection Theory - The Theory Behind Female Mate Choice - She Discusses What Female Primates Actually Do. Drawing On Her Own Firsthand Observation Of Nonhuman Primates, She Shows That Some Are Highly Promiscuous, Others Prefer Several Unfamiliar Males, And Some Apparently Make No Choices At All. The Behavior Of The Undiscriminating Females Often Affects The Evolution Of Relationships Between The Sexes And Can Influence The Social Structure Of A Species. In A Final Chapter On Human Behavior, Small Maintains That The Human Pair-bond Is A Tenuous Compromise Made By The Two Sexes To Bring Up Highly Dependent Infants. But, She Writes, Because Both Sexes Also Have A Natural Tendency To Seek Out Other Partners, That Bond Is Always At Risk. Small Insists That Female Choice Is Not Necessarily Sexual Selection, But Is Nonetheless Important To Female Fitness. Sure To Provoke Controversy, Her Book Will Add A New Twist To An Exciting Field Of Research While Offering Significant Clues As To The Origins Of Our Own Sexuality.--jacket. 1.

Three days later, her body, badly bruised and waterlogged, was found floating in the shallow waters of the Hudson River just a few feet from the Jersey shore. A long celebrated unsolved mystery, this case became the subject of endless commentary and speculation in the new penny press and the popular novel, and received its most famous exposition in Edgar Allan Poe's pioneering detective story The Mystery of Marie Roget. <p>In <i>The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers</i>, historian Amy Gilman Srebnick brilliantly recaptures the story of Mary Rogers, showing how Rogers represented an emerging class of urban women and how her death became a touchstone for mid-nineteenth century concerns over sexual license, the changing roles of women, law and order, and abortion. Rogers' death, first thought due to a murderous gang of rapists and later tacitly understood to be the result of an ill-performed abortion, quickly became a source of popular entertainment, a topic of political debate, and an inspiration to public policy, including the 1845 New York State law criminalizing abortion. The incident and the city's response to it provides a fascinating window into the urban culture and consciousness of the mid-1800s.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.56 inches, Length: 6.5 inches, Weight: 1.28 Pounds, Width: 0.878 inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/73/9780195062373.jpg,Success,105,18.3

This book documents a wide variety of different forms of feminist activism in the 1990s, from organisations such as Rights for Women and Southall Black Sisters to Asian Women's Work in Refuges. It raises questions about the meaning of feminist activism and its interpretation within women's studies and other academic disciplines. The chapters suggest, against much current representation within women's studies and elsewhere, that feminism is still alive.; With a comprehensive introduction providing an historical overview of the development of feminist activism from second wave feminism onwards, this text is intended to be of use as a resource for all students of women's studies and related courses.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Essays document feminist activism in the UK, describing the work of organizations such as Southall Black Sisters, Lesbians Organizing Together, and Women Against Fundamentalism, and highlighting the institutionalization and professionalization of the women's movement since the 1980s and its increasing diversity.

In this novel about love surpassing conventional barriersdeemed too revolutionary during its day (the early 1840s) for wide dissemination and only now translated into EnglishSand lets rip her radical views on egalitarianism of the classes and equality between the sexes. Set in Paris during the student unrest against the bourgeois king, Louis-Philippe, in 1832, Horace concerns the coming-of-age of a law student from a provincial family whose head is utterly turned by the opportunities in the big city to better himself both in fortune and in love. Horace is smooth but vain and boastful; he wins the lovely grisette Marthe because he must have passion and the Viscountess de Chailly because he must have glory, though in the end he loses his honor. While some of the characters, such as Marthe, are bland paradigms of working-class virtue, others, like Horace and the Viscountess, have teeth: they were evidently modeled on people in Sand's life.

Here Irving is concerned again with people who do not feel at home in the world: immigrants, social outcasts, pariahs because of physical handicaps, those uncomfortable with their sexual orientation. The characters include a Bombay-born physician and secret screenwriter who feels as much a foreigner in India as he does in his new home, Toronto; a movie star who is synonymous with the role he plays; his twin brother, who aspires to be a priest but doubts his vocation; assorted circus performers, dwarfs and cripples, prostitutes, transsexuals, policemen, Hollywood figures, a blonde American hippie, Jesuit missionaries and more sad folk teeming with strange quirks and shameful secrets. The plot revolves around the murders of prostitutes by a transsexual serial killer, who carves a winking elephant on their bodies, and the legacies from the past that bring the main characters to the hunt for the murderer. The hefty narrative gives Irving plenty of room to speculate on outcasts of all kinds, the volatility of sexual identity, the false lure of organized religion, the insidious evil of class distinctions, the chasm between appearance and reality. For those looking for his trademark leitmotifs, Irving provides two: falling into the net and allowed to use the lift . He titillates by equipping a character with a giant dildo. He includes a strange homage to novelist James Salter. His attempt to provoke readers into empathy for humanity's lost souls is admirable, but his novel does not engage the reader until the last hundred pages, and that may not be soon enough to satisfy those yearning for a seductive story.

A woman of enormous courage, both in life-threatening situations and her challenging of women's traditional roles, Tina Modotti's life became the stuff of myth and legend. Based on years of painstaking research in Mexico, Europe and the United States, Tina Modotti - Photographer and Revolutionary includes a wealth of new material and is a major step toward demythologizing the life of one of the most fascinating women of an extraordinary era. In 1913 Tina Modotti left her native Italy for San Francisco, becoming a star of the local Italian theatre before marrying the romantic poet-painter Roubaix de l'Abrie Richey. By 1920, she had embarked on a Hollywood film career and immersed herself in bohemian Los Angeles, beginning an intense relationship with the respected American photographer, Edward Weston. On a trip to Mexico in 1922 to bury her husband, she met the Mexican muralists and became enthralled with the burgeoning cultural renaissance there. Increasingly dissatisfied with the film world, she persuaded Weston to teach her photography and move with her to Mexico. Her Mexico City homes became renowned gathering places for artists, writers and radicals, where Diego Rivera courted Frida Kahlo and Latin American exiles plotted revolution. Turning her camera to record Mexico in its most vibrant years, her photographs achieve a striking synthesis of artistic form and social content. Her contact with Mexico's muralists, including a brief affair with Rivera, led to her involvement in radical politics. In 1929, she was framed for the murder of her Cuban lover, gunned down at her side on a Mexico City street.

Reading from the Heart is an engrossing exploration of the needs and desires that lead to a reading habit. Part paean to the reading life, part autobiography, it shows that reading and real life are not warring enterprises but interrelated experiences, each composed of need and fantasy, yearning and satisfaction. As every reading woman knows, novels are not escapes from reality but spaces of the possible, where they can experiment with other ways of feeling and being. Interweaving the story of her journey to self-discovery with her girlhood infatuation with Little Women, her adolescent immersion in Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, and her adult experiences reading Gloria Naylor's Mama Day and Isabel Miller's famous lesbian novel Patience and Sarah, Juhasz convincingly demonstrates that the romance plot of finding, losing, and regaining true love is as much about identity as it is about love. And she makes the provocative argument that women's fantasy of true love is a version of mother love, in which the hero of a novel offers the unconditional, maternal acceptance that enables the heroine to develop an authentic self. Like Mary Catherine Bateson's Composing a Life and Carolyn Heilbrun's Writing a Woman's Life, Reading from the Heart is a personal book that transcends the purely personal. It will be a touchstone for women who love to read and believe that reading can change their lives.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Juhasz, an English professor at the University of Colorado, explores the intriguing notion that identification with characters in romantic fiction assists women with issues relating to selfhood. Drawing on novels she has read and theories of mother-infant bonding by psychologist D. W. Winnicott, she provides an autobiographical analysis of her relationships to literary figures. Juhasz posits, for example, that Jane Austen was her ``author-mother'' during a reading of Pride and Prejudice while in her teens, because she identified emotionally with Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, in her search for true love. Connections with other heroines created by such authors as Charlotte Bronte, Louisa May Alcott and Gloria Naylor helped her focus on many aspects of her own life. From reading lesbian romantic fiction, Juhasz was able to let bloom repressed sexual feeling toward women. A close and thoughtful look at varieties of romantic love for women.

Her bold and controversial work reflects a poet's sensitivity and a scholar's insights."" --Rabbi David Teutsch, President, Reconstructionist Rabbinical College 
<p>""Marcia Falk recasts the English of our blessings with her exquisite poetry and uniquely refacets the Hebrew with the caution, precision and artistry of a jeweler."" --Susan Weidman Schneider, Editor-in-Chief, Lilith: <i>The Independent Jewish Women's Magazine</i></p>
<p>Through the act of blessing, we awaken our appreciation of the world's abiding gifts. In <i>The Book of Blessings</i>, Marcia Falk re-creates Jewish prayer by offering new blessings, poems and meditations that focus on the sacred potential of each moment. Evoking the diversity of human experience, <i>The Book of Blessings</i> provides a collage of poetic form that invites us to celebrate ""the dynamic, alive and unifying wholeness within creation."" Steeped in dialogue within rabbinical tradition, it calls into question the tradition's patriarchal assumptions and challenges hierarchical structures of power.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking work in the literature of spirituality, <i>The Book of Blessings</i> offers, for the first time, a complete new liturgy, in Hebrew as well as English, for use in both house and the community on weekdays, Sabbaths and the festival of the New Moon. The liturgy is enhanced by a Commentary that illuminates its meanings for scholars and general readers alike.</p>
<p><i>The Book of Blessings</i> is for those who are in the habit of praying and for those who are not. It is for those dissatisfied withthe traditional liturgy and for those who wish to supplement it. <i>The Book of Blessings</i> is a part of an ongoing conversation that seeks to keep Judaism vital and responsive to our spiritual needs and moral concerns.</p>
<p>Poet and translator Marcia Falk received a B.A. in philosophy from Brandeis University and a Ph.D. in English and comparative literature from Stanford. She was a Fulbright Scholar and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she studied Bible and Hebrew literature. A university professor for many years, she now lectures widely. Her other books include <i>The Song of Songs: A New Translation and Interpretation</i> and <i>With Teeth in the Earth: Selected Poems of Malka Heifetz Tussman</i>. She is currently at work on further volumes of blessings for the major and minor festivals, the High Holidays, the Passover Haggadah and the ordinary and extraordinary events of the life cycle.</p>
<p>More Praise for <i>The Book of Blessings</i>:</p>
<p>""Not since Miriam danced at the Red Sea or Deborah praised God in song has the voice of women's soul in prayer been so passionately articulated."" --Rabbi Naamah Kelman, Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism</p>
<p>""Marcia Falk's work on Hebrew blessings is as beautiful as it is innovative; and it is innovative in the sweetest, most nourishing sense, saturated in love for the language itself (its overtones and melodies as well as its deep structure), its history, its people. Even those who do not hear the traditional liturgies as exclusionary will respond to the meticulously flowering poet's passion of Marcia Falk's wholly original contribution."" --Cynthia Ozick</p>
<p>""If anyone can revive the habit of praying, it is Marcia Falk. <i>The Book of Blessings</i> is a collection of eloquent and inspiring prayers that avoid anthropomorphisms and male domination. Marcia Falk invites the so-called secularist to pray without sacrificing intellectual or moral integrity."" --Rabbi Ira Eisenstein, President Emeritus, Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, and Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, Ph.D., Hebrew Union College</p>
<p>""Falk's rare poetic, spiritual, and intellectual gifts ensure that this long-awaited volume of feminist prayer will remain an enduring treasure, expanding the vocabulary of Jewish liturgy and awakening and deepening awareness of the holy in every aspect of life."" --Judith Plaskow, author of <i>Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective</i></p>
<p>""This is a work of art, a comprehensive revisioning of Judaism's liturgical genius from the pen of consummate poet and Hebraist Marcia Falk."" --Rabbi Lawrence A. Hoffman, Professor of Liturgy, Hebrew Union College</p>
<p>About Marcia Falk's <i>The Song of Songs: A New Translation and Interpretation</i>:</p>
<p>""An exceptional poetic job. Marcia Falk has great power in her language."" --Isaac Bashevis Singer, Nobel Laureate</p>

The law has proved a primary battleground, for it is the law that establishes the contours of sexuality itself and mediates social questions such as how ""open"" lesbians and gay men can be about their sexuality, where and under what conditions gay people can work, whether they can marry or adopt children, and so on. In a fresh attempt to focus attention on this rapidly evolving field, William B. Rubenstein, the director of the ACLU's national Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, designed for Harvard Law School one of the first courses in the United States to examine both the history of the legal treatment of lesbians and gay men and the many current arenas in which related debates are raging. Rubenstein's anthology, Lesbians, Gay Men, and the Law is the first published casebook in this field. Rubenstein places reported cases and other legal readings in a historical framework and complements the legal texts with selections ranging from fiction and poetry to psychology, sociology, theology, oral history, and journalism. Organized according to the life experience of lesbians and gay men, the book includes chapters entitled, ""What we talk about when we talk about sexual orientation,"" ""Having sex/making love,"" ""Coming out/speaking out/joining in,"" ""Working,"" ""Coupling,"" and ""Parenting."" The result is a pathbreaking documentary reader and an essential sourcebook for anyone interested in gay and lesbian issues.",en,Subsequent,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/26/9781565843226.jpg,Success,129,18.3

The four Ford children were taught the value of learning and hard work by their father, a cowboy with a serious love of poetry, and their mother, a Texas woman whose rural roots did not prevent her from mastering Latin or reading all of Shakespeare. Susan became a noted classics scholar, while John's work in Republican politics led to his appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in the Reagan Administration, from which he resigned in frustration to become active in the American Farm Movement. Just two weeks before his death, he was given the Heroes of American Agriculture Award. When disaster struck and John was diagnosed with AIDS, Susan began writing a work reminiscent of May Sarton's journals, Madeleine L'Engle's Two-Part Invention, and Jessamyn West's The Woman Said Yes. Drawing on the force of family bonds and her humanistic training in classical studies for comfort and guidance, she shows us two siblings sharing an agonizing but special journey, finding opportunities rather than resignation, commitment rather than withdrawal, and strength instead of defeat. This is, in short, a good and inspiring story - one that will help point the way for the millions of others - those who are HIV positive as well as their friends and families - who bear the emotional wounds this disease is inflicting on ever-increasing numbers of us.

                        <p>When disaster struck and her brother John was diagnosed with AIDS, Susan Ford Wiltshire and her brother began an agonizing but special journey together. This is the story of that journey--a story of finding possibilities rather than resignation, of finding strength instead of defeat. Wiltshire's memoir gives voice to all family members touched by this terrible disease.

Probing, dramatic, rich in anecdote, Martina reveals the happiest—and the most painful—moments in the controversial life of the only woman ever to win nine Wimbledon singles titles. Martina's childhood was a grudge match against the Communist Czech government. When she won that difficult contest, she was given a shot at the American dream. Withstanding extraordinary political and personal pressures, Martina repeatedly reinvented herself, decisively changing her life as she changed the women's game. When the media exposed her lesbian relationships, Martina displayed a courageous and unprecedented candor. No other sports champion has figured so prominently in the arenas of world and sexual politics. Now Adrianne Blue tells the unvarnished story of an astonishing life and speculates on what will become of the woman who broke all the rules, emerging a winner time after time. Included are interviews with people who have been important in Martina's private and professional lives, among them Judy Nelson, Rita Mae Brown, and Billie Jean King; a revealing examination of the inside world of women's tennis; and keen insights into why it is Martina's nature to tempt fate.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/08/9781559723008.jpg,Success,93,18.3
1-57322-509-6,Mary Magdalen: Myth and Metaphor,"Haskins, Susan",Riverhead Trade,528,12/1/1995,,Paperback,"Mary Magdalen has always been a predominant and fascinating figure for Christianity. But who was she really? The Gnostics hailed her as the companion of the Savior and the woman He loved most. Early Christian writers called her the Bride of Christ and the apostle to the apostles. But for centuries her most durable image has been that of a prostitute who repented and devoted her life to Jesus - an image that both shaped and to some extent reflected the Church's attitude toward women. Yet this figure does not appear in the New Testament. All that we know of the real Magdalen are the four facts noted in the Gospels: she was one of Christ's followers; she was present at His crucifixion; she was one of the earliest witnesses of His resurrection; and she was the first person to be charged with proclaiming the Christian message. But somewhere along the line she was confused with Mary, the sister of Lazarus, and with the woman taken in adultery whose life Jesus saved. Using evidence from early Christian writings, medieval sermons, devotional works, and the art and literature of nearly two thousand years, Susan Haskins shows how Mary Magdalen merged with other figures in the New Testament until she came to epitomize the condition of women in the Church and in society. Today, when women are assuming more active roles in both, Mary Magdalen is once again being reevaluated.",en,,"Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 5.62 Inches, Weight: 1.45064168396 Pounds, Width: 1.18 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/90/9781573225090.jpg,Success,133,18.3
