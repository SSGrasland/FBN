The Mystical Initiation of a Contemporary Woman
Janet Adler • Foreword by Joan Halifax ° 0-89281-577-9 © $19.95 hardcover
“Rarely are we given the gift of reading a story of a direct embodied
experience of the numinous. Janet Adler's account of her initiation
rings with authenticity as she is taken through the mystical spirals of
hell and heaven. A splendid book!”
Marion Woodman, author of Leaving My Father's House
“An eloquent and lyrical prose poem, riveting testimony from a
modern mystic. Adler offers this narrative of her extraordinary
journey, traversing territory both intensely intimate and primordial,
luminous and transcendent. This is a heroine's mythic journey, as
fascinating as it is mysterious.”

Women have always been healers, but with the rise of male-
dominated religious and political systems, the value of their
contributions to medicine were gradually discredited to the
point of persecution. Elisabeth Brooke corrects centuries of
wrongs in her reconstructive history of women healers from
ancient times to the present.
“Elisabeth Brooke's women healers are gentle and compassionate
people, less concerned with the brilliance of developing technology
than with the care of the patient.” The Daily Mail

Vandalism
The Book Garden reports an unpleasant bit of
vandalism: someone came by one night and pulled all
the flowers in their planter boxes — roots and all.
Their not-always-cheery landlord came by early in the
morning and was so outraged that he replanted them
all. Frustrated at not causing enough damage, the
vandals came back and poured something on the
grass that killed it.

lingering grief over the loss of her first female lover.
Louise finally musters the courage to take action when
her best friend’s teenage daughter is caught smug-

unsavory truths about her ex-husband, comes to
terms with her unfulfilled past and eventually stum-

The Stained-Glass Ceiling
ChSurcahesl alndy Th eir WBom.en P asPtorsurvis Paper $11.99
As record numbers of women graduate from seminaries, they are increasingly filling positions once held
exclusively by men. Sally Purvis documents what happened in the lives of two congregations that appointed
women senior pastors and the impact these appointments had on all concerned. She deals head-on with the
day-to-day realities of women in church leadership and offers an indication of what the future may hold for
women in church leadership tomorrow. ""A fascinating study of two women pastors who broke the
stained-glass ceiling!' . . . Recommended reading for all who are about renewal of congregational life in the late
twentieth-century United States."" — Letty Russell, Yale Divinity School
The Engendering God
Male and Female Faces of God
CarDl A. e Rascchkee andm Susan b Dougehtyr Ras chk ePaper $17.99
The authors argue that God's own self-revelation is neither exclusively male nor female but both at once. They
contend that the scriptures are actually a radical proclamation of gender equality.
Reimagining God
The Case for Scriptural Diversity
Johanna W. H. van Wijk-Bos Paper $12.99
""'Reimagining' is a crucial and indispensable interpretive practice already at work in the Bible itself. Bos shows
herself not only to be in the middle of the conversation concerning how God will be respoken, she demonstrates
in this thoughtful and careful discussion how to do it, why it must be done, and what an enormous difference it
makes.""— Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary

radical methodology to an English-speaking audience. Offering a fundamentally different theory of the parables,

many of these essays, written during the past 20 years, with challenges

from the introduction of Killing Rage:
“When race and racism are the topic in public discourse
the voices that speak are male. There is no large body of social and political
critique by women on the topic of race... Traditionally seen as a discourse
between men just as feminism has been seen as the discourse of women...
It presumes that the business of race is down and dirty stuff, and therefore like
all male locker rooms, spaces no real woman would want to enter.”

OURIKA
An English Translation
FOREWORD BY JOHN FOWLES
Introduction by Joan DeJean and Margaret Waller
John Fowles presents a remarkable translation of a nineteenth-century work that
provided the seed for his acclaimed novel The French Lieutenant’s Woman and that
will astonish and haunt modern readers. Based on a true story, Ourika relates the
experiences of a Senegalese girl who is rescued from slavery and raised by an
aristocratic French family during the French Revolution. Brought up in a household
of learning and privilege, she is unaware of her difference until she overhears a con-
versation that makes her suddenly conscious of her race—and of the prejudice it
arouses. As the Reign of Terror threatens her and her adoptive family, Ourika
struggles with her unusual position as an educated African woman in eighteenth-

PROFESSIONS OF DESIRE
Lesbian and Gay Studies in Literature
EDITED BY GEORGE E. HAGGERTY AND BONNIE ZIMMERMAN
A collection of eighteen essays on pedagogical issues concerning lesbian and gay
studies in the undergraduate classroom, Professions of Desire will challenge teachers
and students of literature with new materials, new approaches, and new ideas.
Professions of Desire includes examples of lesbian and gay critical analysis and
thoughtful discussions about what it means to be lesbian, gay, or queer in the class-
room. The four essays in the first section, “Teaching Positions,” examine teaching
from a theoretical perspective, analyze the role of the professor in the classroom,
PROF! , and seek to redefine what instructors ask of their students as well as of themselves.
In “Canons and Closets,” five essays discuss curricular and organizational shifts
related to lesbian and gay studies. “Sameness and Differences” presents five essays
that explore the influence of race, gender, and sexuality on gay and lesbian identity.
Finally, the section “Transgressing Subjects” gathers critical readings of various
works of literature and art.
