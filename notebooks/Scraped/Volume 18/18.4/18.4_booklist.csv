She Spent Much Of Her Short Life In North Africa, Where She Was Converted To Islam And Learned To Speak Fluent Arabic. Her Eccentric Behavior Shocked The French Colonials.

Then a local girl who looks like Peggy vanishes without a trace.<P>Although she was once famous, Peggy has no fondness for the old times. Those days are best left forgotten for Spencer Arrowood, too. But sometimes the past can't rest, and those who try to forget it are doomed to relive it....</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>McCrumb surpasses lauded earlier novels, including 1988 Edgar winner Bimbos of the Death Sun , with this inventive mystery. Sheriff Spencer Arrowood remembers Peggy Muryan, a newcomer to Hamelin, Tenn., as a moderately popular folksinger of the 1960s. Hoping to compose fresh songs in the quiet town, Peggy instead attracts messages from a secret killer. Arrowood and Deputy Joe LeDonne answer her call for help and the latter, a Vietnam veteran, recognizes descriptions of the war's horrors in the threats. Peggy's dog is killed, and later a girl with a strong resemblance to her, but it's a long, suspenseful struggle for the sheriff and his right-hand man to learn the terrible, astonishing facts in the case.

Learn from their inspiring and instructive stories.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Brooks's (Texas A&M, psychology) supposition is that men have been given the Penthouse and Playboy centerfolds as a cultural idea of the perfect woman to seek out. Unfortunately, the icon does not usually live up to reality, and the discrepancy can prevent mature male/female interpersonal relations and intimacy. The centerfold syndrome, indoctrinated sometimes subtly, depersonalizes women, perpetuates anatomical falsities, and creates idealized and unreal fantasies about sex and sexuality; in short, it makes women objects of conquest, not people to interact with. The elements of this syndrome include (1) voyeurism (omnipresent images of naked and near-naked women), (2) objectification (women become objects to be observed), (3) need for validation through sexual conquest, (4) trophyism (women's bodies as trophies to be ""collected""), and (5) fear of intimacy (insensitivity to emotional needs and issues). Brooks presents discussion in one of his men's groups as an example of the syndrome, goes on to debunk conventional wisdom, then provides some dozen modi operandi for overcoming it (to create harmony in one's sensual, sexual, social, spiritual, and emotional self).

<li>methodological issues associated with conducting research with older lesbians</li>
<li>an analysis of ethical dilemmas associated with conducting research in lesbian communities</li>

Then came disaster: Thread fell like rain. Humans struggled to survive. Now -- centuries later -- dragonriders and dolphins face a new era, reviving the bond between land and ocean dwellers.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this latest addition to McCaffrey's popular Pern series (Chronicles of Pern: First Fall, etc.), the humans of Pern are reunited, after eons of noncontact, with the intelligent dolphins who had originally settled the planet with them. When a boy, Readis, is rescued by ``shipfish'' and realizes that they can talk, he develops a lifelong obsession with the fascinating creatures. But, though his interest is shared by the young dragonrider T'Lion and his dragon, Gadareth, it is forbidden by his mother, who has feared the unusual ever since she was kidnapped by outlaws because of her ability to hear and talk with dragons. Readis pursues his briney friendships nonetheless, reporting his findings to the computer, Aivas, which is attempting to guide the humans to a new era by freeing Pern forever from the devastating, life-consuming Thread. Meanwhile, the leading dragonriders and holdlords must act to contain the lust for land and power of Toric, Lord Holder of the South. Expanding upon events related in All the Weyrs of Pern, McCaffrey here adds yet another dimension to her colorful and vivid saga by focusing on the attractive dolphins and their highly believable society.

Both black and white writers are represented and all share, and are divided by, a common heritage of racism, gender bias, and social stratification. Drawing on letters, journal entries, essays, poems, and fictional pieces, the compilers trace the evolution of the Southern feminine point of view from the early 18th century to the late 20th century. The first writer featured, Eliza Lucas Pinckney, was born in 1772, and, the last, Leigh Allison Wilson, in 1959. Because of its richness and accessibility, the anthology will probably become a standard text in college courses in American Southern literature and women's studies, making it essential for all academic libraries and enthusiastically recommended for all others. Downhome contains 21 previously published short stories by contemporary Southern female writers. Eight of the writers are included in the Weaks-Perry anthologyKatherine Anne Porter, Zora Neale Hurston, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Doris Betts, Bobbie Ann Mason, Alice Walker, and Ellen Gilchristbut only one selection, Bobbie Ann Mason's ""Shiloh,"" appears in both books. Brief paragraphs at the end of the book identify the authors, though editor Mee (fiction, NYU) strains to make her points about a ""shared legacy"" and ""distinctive language."" The stories trace the life cycle from ""Growing Up"" to ""The Pleasures and Miseries of Marriage"" to ""Passing On."" Although this is a good group of stories, as a whole the collection is not unique and not as rigorously researched as Southern Women's Writing.

For those qualified, the Guild was said to provide careers, security, and the chance for unimaginable wealth. But once you'd sung crystal, there was no going back. Killashandra's first season on Ballybran was everything she had hoped for: She had sung Black Crystal, grown wealthy, and met a man who could make her forget her own sorrowful past. But then, a year later, everything had changed. She was broke, she had crystal sickness so bad she thought she'd die, and the only way she could be true to the man she loved was to leave him. Crystal singing changed the singer forever, bringing ecstasy and pain, near-eternal life ... and gradual loss of memory. Killashandra had a lot of painful memories she could afford to lose. What she hadn't counted on was the loneliness she felt when her heart still remembered what her mind had forgotten. Then she found she might have a chance to salvage what was left of her mind. But to do that, she would have to learn to open herself - to another person, and to her own unhappy past.                        <p>Available for the first time in a single volume, the three complete adventures of Killashandra Ree, musician on the planet Ballybran, home of the fabled Black Crystal.

<p>With this scene begins a remarkable, deeply personal narrative by acclaimed fiction writer Merrill Joan Gerber. In a journal covering just less than a year, Gerber weaves together two journeys - one into the joy and renewal of emerging life, the other into the anguished helplessness of again.</p>
<p>Gerber brings unmatched skill, an unerring eye, and unflinching honesty to her first non-fiction book. No one who has ever loved a pet can fail to be moved by Gerber's descriptions of Maxie the kitten - his first days of fear and mistrust, his growing devotion to his owner, his delightful explorations, the profound sense of peace that a purring cat can inspire.</p>
<p>Anyone who has witnessed the gradual decline of a beloved parent will be deeply moved to find the experience reflected in Gerber's words. To her mother's grim refrain - ""I wish i were dead"" - Gerber registers the full spectrum of human response: sorrow and sympathy, impatience and rage, and - along with enormous love - lacerating guilt.</p>
<p>With the complex realities of an aging population bearing upon us as never before, Old Mother, Little Cat is clearly an e-book for our times.</p>

These testimonies reveal the views and experiences of women as fighters, participants, refugees, victims caught between warring factions, organisers for peace and rehabilitation, carers, and mothers, relatives and partners of the dead and the disappeared. Women from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Tigray (Ethiopia), Uganda, Somaliland, Liberia, Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam, Lebanon, Bosnia and Croatia speak of the psychological and physical damage of war, and the battle for economic survival.

Rona and Cassie. Two women on a driving holiday in Northern France. A caustic, coruscating and deeply funny account of morality, dysfunctional relationships and women abroad, Foreign Parts is that rare hybrid&#58;a strikingly original novel about real life, told with accuracy, compassion and a truly saturnine delight.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>``Cassie and Rona/Rona and Cassie have eaten sandwiches in Amsterdam and Gouda, Copenhagen, York, Warsaw, Munich and Lerwick... It's what we always do. We get no richer, no more sophisticated, no more included.'' Cassie and Rona, two 40-ish, single Scotswomen take a trip to France. Simple enough. But what Galloway uncovers through following their often hellish tour is the rawness of an individual out of context, the need for the familiar and the facts of friendship. Capturing the tawdriness and petty humiliations possible en route, Galloway's tumultuous, evocative prose is interrupted by the banal exhortations of a guide book (``Car drivers should NOT MISS the opportunity of driving through the beautiful, winding roads of the Layon Valley'') and by Cassie's slide show as she describes photographs of past trips and the men who dominated them. Ultimately, however, travel is a backdrop for a sharp, funny, tender but never maudlin dissection of what it means to be friends. It's not that Rona and Cassie don't get on each others nerves, but there is equality, caring, everyday kindness, patience and loyalty that neither woman has found with men. ``You only get the one shot at things and men use up too much energy,'' says Rona. ``Dependencies build up, then the power games: the moral blackmail, the intellectual blackmail, the guilt, the guilt-it goes on forever.''

The essays offer both new directions for, and new insights into, reading O'Connor's fiction. Some essays probe issues that, until recently, had been ignored. Others reshape long-standing debates in light of new critical insights from gender studies, rhetorical theory, dialogism, and psychoanalysis. Topics discussed include O'Connor's early stories, her canonical status, the phenomenon of doubling, the feminist undertones of her stories' grotesqueries, and her self-denial in life and art. Commentary on O'Connor has most often centered on her regional realism and the poetics of her Catholicism. By regarding O'Connor as a major American writer and focusing on the variety of critical approaches that might be taken to her work, these essays dispel the earlier geographic and religious stereotypes and point out new avenues of study.<p></p><h3>Booknews</h3><p>Brownell draws on her experiences, observations, and fieldwork as a combination athlete and social scientist in China 1985-87 to locate the bodies of Chinese athletes within the larger universe of ideas.

Craig Monson reconstructs the daily lives of Italian nuns, often in their own words, and relates their musical life to the broad social context in which it unfolded. He introduces a virtually unknown nun composer, relating her family history and how the convent allowed her creativity to flower. The study is meticulously researched, marvelously detailed, and entertaining to read.<br>
<br>
In sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century Bologna, approximately one-seventh of the entire female population lived behind convent walls. Santa Cristina became home for a number of gifted women musicians, many from among the upper classes, who sought ""respectable"" musical careers. Monson documents the struggle of these women as they fought to maintain their musical and ritual traditions in the face of persistent opposition from church officials. Figuring prominently in the story of Santa Cristina is Lucrezia Vizzana (1590-1662), Bologna's only published nun composer, who entered the convent at the age of eight.<br>
This study is as much about social and cultural history as it is about music.

One of the most important feminist thinkers, Fatima Mernissi here makes a major contribution to the theorisation of gender roles and sexual identity in the Islamic world.<br>
<br>
The book first explores some of the concrete issues fundamental to the status of muslim women, such as the production of statistics which mask women's contribution to the economies of Arab states. Mernissi also looks at a variety of demographics including education and literacy - she shows their importance not only for empowering women but also for improving their health. She analyses the role of the state in prescribing women's roles, activities and spheres and explores the insidious consequences of state supported inequality - not only for women but for the creative and spiritual life of a culture.<br>
<br>
She goes on to look at the position of women in Islamic thought and history and the construction of femininity in the muslim unconscious. She presents a sustained analysis of some of the Koranic formulations of gender, and demonstrates how very partisan the collective Islamic memory - of both history and theology - can be. Throughout, Mernissi argues that the emancipation of women is vital for the development of the Arab world.<br>",en,,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/87/9781856493987.jpg,Success,86,18.4

Paradoxically, doctors and mental health professionals have also seen a staggering increase in the numbers of young women suffering from an epidemic of depression, eating disorders, and other physical and psychological problems. In <b>The Cost of Competence</b>, authors Brett Silverstein and Deborah Perlick argue that rather than simply labeling individual women as, say, anorexic or depressed, it is time to look harder at the widespread prejudices within our society and child-rearing practices that lead thousands of young women to equate thinness with competence and success, and femininity with failure. They argue that continuing to treat depression, anxiety, anorexia and bulimia as separate disorders in young women can, in many cases, be a misguided approach since they are really part of a single syndrome. Furthermore, their fascinating research into the lives of forty prominent women from Elizabeth I to Eleanor Roosevelt show that these symptoms have been disrupting the lives of bright, ambitious women not for decades, but for centuries.<br>
 Drawing on all the latest findings, rare historical research, cross-cultural comparisons, and their own study of over 2,000 contemporary women attending high schools and colleges, the authors present powerful new evidence to support the existence of a syndrome they call anxious somatic depression. Their investigation shows that the first symptoms usually surface in adolescence, most often in young women who aspire to excel academically and professionally. Many of the affected women grew up feeling that their parents valued sons over daughters. They identified intellectually with their successful fathers, not with their traditional homemaker mothers. Disordered eating is one way of rejecting the feminine bodies they perceive as barriers to achievement and recognition.<br>
 Silverstein and Perlick uncover medical descriptions matching their diagnosis in Hippocratic texts from the fourth century B.C., in anthropological studies of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in case studies of many noted psychologists and psychiatrists, including the ""hysteric"" patients Freud used to develop his theories on psychoanalysis. They have also discovered that statistics on disordered eating, depression, and a host of other symptoms soared in eras in which women's opportunities grew—particularly the 1920s, when record numbers of women entered college and the workforce, the boyish silhouette of the flapper became the feminine ideal, and anorexia became epidemic, and again from the 1970s to the present day.<br>
 The authors show that identifying this devastating syndrome is a first step toward its prevention and cure. <b>The Cost of Competence</b> presents an urgent message to parents, educators, policymakers, and the medical community on the crucial importance of providing young women with equal opportunity, and equal respect.</p>

In contemporary metropolises, there are trauma centers, where highly trained medical staffs use the latest in technology to treat the devastating wounds of inner-city gunfire and highway disaster. Cat takes the reader behind the scenes, into one of Chicago's most impressive trauma centers, to see from the inside how one really works.

Dr. Hannah Grant, director of the trauma center, had graciously welcomed Cat, so it's a particular shock when Dr. Grant is found murdered in the staff lounge, a gauze pad stuffed down her throat. Because the unit is isolated from the rest of the hospital complex, Cat knows one of the staff must be the killer. Is it the trauma surgeon who had recently been replaced as director? The young student nurse from downstate who was being cautioned by the director because of poor work? The attending physician who may have a hidden financial motive that the director discovered?

When Cat finally discovers the trauma center's darkest secret, she must fight for her own life, stalked through the hospital kitchens by a desperate killer.

The author's philosophy is frequently cited as the first presentation of reader-response theory, but she differs from her successors in emphasizing both the reader and the text. Her transactional theory of literature examines the reciprocal nature of the literary experience and explains why meaning is neither in the text nor in the reader. Each reading is a particular event involving a particular reader and a particular text under particular circumstances. And teachers of literature, Rosenblatt argues, play a pivotal role in influencing how students perform in response to a text. Students, teachers, and scholars reading the book for the first time will be as enlightened and challenged by this classic work as earlier generations have been.

An inhabitant of this country for five years, Lim-Wilson's legal status is that of resident alien, a disturbing but apt description given the clash of cultures the immigrant encounters daily. Although she still dreams in her native Tagalog, Lim-Wilson writes in her borrowed language, and it is through attempting to understand the cleaving of her own tongue that she works to redefine her place and that of other immigrants here. How can memories of green mangoes, miniature fish, and the landscape of seven thousand islands fit in with, let alone contribute to, a North American cultural identity?

Through a series of interviews with participants at all levels in the resistance, Margaret Randall recounts the lives of ordinary women who became pillars of strength and perseverance during their decades-long involvement in the Sandinista struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. Believing firmly that women's liberation was inextricably linked with national liberation, many of these women were in the vanguard of the movement inspired by Augusto Sandino. At the peak of revolutionary activity, women from all classes and backgrounds comprised 30 percent of the Sandinista army. For many of these women, politics became one with the personal. Hindsight perhaps offers the greatest irony of the women's alliance with the FSLN in the fact that it was a woman, Violeta Chamorro, who challenged and defeated the Sandinistas in the free elections of 1990. Though lured by the revolutionary quixotism of a promise that lasted slightly more than a decade, the women of Sandino's Daughters will stand as a monument to all those who yearn to be free.",en,Revised edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",28.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/42/9780813522142.jpg,Success,88,18.4

She examines the social and demographic foundations of the Hanoverian women's movement, interweaving local history with developments on the national level. Using the German experience as a case study, Reagin explores the links between political conservatism and a feminist agenda based on a belief in innate gender differences.</p>
<p>Reagin's analysis encompasses a wide variety of women's organizations—feminist, nationalist, religious, philanthropic, political, and professional. It focuses on the ways in which bourgeois women's class background and political socialization, and their support of the idea of 'spiritual motherhood,' combined within an antidemocratic climate to produce a conservative, maternalist approach to women's issues and other political matters. According to Reagin, the fact that the women's movement evolved in this way helps to explain why so many middle-class women found National Socialism appealing.</p>",en,3rd ed.,"Height: 9.26 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.10892517786 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches",42,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/57/9780807845257.jpg,Success,90,18.4

Psychologists and scholars can benefit from Meredith Kimball’s analysis and the tensions she creates because they ultimately broaden feminist visions. She informs the political analysis of those working on the inside and those on the outside of feminism to end all forms of discrimination and oppression.</p>
<p>In opening the dialogue between the two traditions, Kimball</p>
<ul>
<li>presents a brief history of gender research and equal-rights feminisms in the early twentieth century, with an in-depth analysis of the work of Leta Stetter Hollingworth.</li>
<li>analyzes women’s experience in and feminist critiques of science and technology.</li>
<li>analyzes research on gender-related similarities and differences in mathematics achievement.</li>

<p>The educated reader, whether actively involved in feminism or the general political arena, can apply the non-reductionist political analysis to their own theories and research. Because all oppressed groups face dilemmas of integrating into the dominant culture versus changing the dominant culture, members of these groups will appreciate the over-arching political analysis that forms the theme of Feminist Visions of Gender Similarities and Differences.</p>

Analytically astute.""—Ursula R. Mahlendorf, University of California, Santa Barbara</p>
<p>""An important new view of German fascism under Hitler and after. . . .&nbsp; Makes a convincing argument that the division of gender in our Western society (including democracies) constitutes fascist practice. . . .&nbsp; Rejects the idea that fascist practice could thrive only in a totalitarian government.""—Helga W. Kraft, University of Florida</p>
<p>""Superbly designed to draw in readers. . . . Instrumental in shaping and reshaping the way we go about assessing the complex relationship of women and the texts of literature and history.""—Patricia Herminghouse, University of Rochester</p>
<p>In this critical women's history, Marie-Luise Gättens focuses on the intersecting of gender and fascism and on the problems of feminist historiography.<br>
 &nbsp;Virginia Woolf's <i>Three Guineas</i> (written in Britain in the 1930s) argues that fascism depends on a patriarchal notion of gender and provides a European framework for the four contemporary German women writers that Gättens studies.&nbsp; Ruth Rehmann <i>(Der Mann auf der Kanzel: Fragen an einen Vater)</i> describes a daughter who attempts to understand why her father, a Protestant pastor, refused to perceive the criminal nature of National Socialism.&nbsp; Christa Wolf's autobiographical novel <i>(Patterns of Childhood)</i> reconstructs the way that practices under National Socialism created ""the German girl"" who is in opposition to men as well as to all non-German women.&nbsp; Helga Schubert <i>(Judasfrauen)</i> confronts women's collaboration with National Socialism, as she retraces the cases of ten women who informed for the Secret Security Police (Gestapo).&nbsp; Finally, Monika Maron <i>(Silent Clove 6)</i> , writing after the fall of the Berlin Wall, stages a struggle between a female historian and a high functionary of the German Democratic Republic in the late 1980s.<br>
 &nbsp;In each of the works, ""making sense of the past"" is explicitly treated as a complicated interpretive process.&nbsp; Gättens writes from the premise that our understanding of the past is written overwhelmingly in terms of men's historical experience and that studying women's accounts will deepen our understanding of National Socialism.&nbsp; She shows, however, that feminist history does not offer pat answers for a nonfascist society.<br>
 &nbsp;This study draws on recent work of feminist theoreticians who work within the framework of semiotics, Marxism, and ""the poststructural discussion of the subject,"" as well as Michel Foucault's notion of the disciplines.</p>
<p>Marie-Luise Gättens is associate professor of German at Southern Methodist University.&nbsp; She is the author of articles and book chapters in English and German that deal with feminist theory, women's history, and German and contemporary women's literature.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.12 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",26.69,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/12/9780813014012.jpg,Success,90,18.4

Concepts derived from writings about one area of the world cannot simply be transposed to another area, in some sort of global theoretical move. Moreover, place in the discourse of Victorian imperialism is a matter of gendered as well as geographic terms. Taking up works by Anna Forbes and Marianne North on the Malay Archipelago, by Margaret Brooke and Harriette McDougall on Sarawak, by Isabella Bird and Emily Innes on British Malaya, by Anna Leonowens on Siam, Morgan also makes extensive use of theorists whose work on imperialism in Southeast Asia is unfamiliar to most American academics. This vivid examination of a different region and different writings emphasizes that in Victorian literature there was no monolithic imperialist location, authorial or geographic. The very notion of a ""colony"" or an ""imperial presence"" in Southeast Asia is problematic. Morgan is concerned with marking the intersections of particular Victorian imperial histories and constructions of subjectivity. She argues that specific places in Southeast Asia have distinctive, and differing, masculine imperial rhetorics. It is within these specific rhetorical contexts that women's writings, including their moments of critique, can be read.",en,1st Ed.,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Width: 1 Inches",28,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/94/9780813522494.jpg,Success,88,18.4

From queer readings of early modern medical texts to transcribing and interrogating pre-modern documents of sexual transgression, the contributors bring together current theoretical discourses on sexuality while emphasizing problems in historicist interpretation of early textualizations of sexuality. <i>Premodern Sexualities</i> clarifies the contributions literary studies can make--through its emphasis on reading strategies--to the historiogrphy of sexuality.<p>Editors Louise Fradenburg and Carla Freccero construct a genealogy for the history of sexuality, sexual practices and sexual identities, by expanding the recent abundance of work in the history of sexuality, most notably popularized by John Boswell's <i>Same-Sex Unions in Pre-modern Europe</i>. Expanding on a special issue of the GLQ which explored the role of pleasure in the construction of narratives about premodernity and modernity, Fradenburg and Freccero call for a rethinking of the categories of history and sexuality in ways that mutually transform each other in the much needed encounter between historicism and queer theory.<p><i>Premodern Sexualities</i> is organized into sections that address some of the most significant concerns in sexuality studies today, with essays by scholars from a wide range of literay and historical disciplines.

0-8203-1757-8,Discovering the Women in Slavery: Emancipating Perspectives on the American Past,,University of Georgia Press,336,1/1/1996,,Paperback,"<p><i>Discovering the Women in Slavery</i> is a collection of fourteen original essays on women's experiences of slavery in America, researched and written from gender- and women-focused perspectives. The essays discuss not only slave women, but also plantation and slaveholding mistresses and free women of color, in contexts ranging from the colonial era to the Civil War South. Intended for wide readership, this book is especially designed to bring attention to the new questions and findings about American slavery that are engendered by today's exploration of the experience and roles of the women generally left invisible, stereotyped, or both, by conventional American slavery history.</p>
<p>As Patricia Morton notes in her historiographical introduction, <i>Discovering the Women in Slavery</i> continues the advances made, especially over the last decade, in understanding how women experienced slavery and shaped slavery history. In addition, the collection illuminates some emancipating new perspectives and methodologies. Throughout, the contributors pay close attention--over time and place--to variations, differences, and diversity regarding issues of gender and sex, race and ethnicity, and class. They draw on such qualitative sources as letters, novels, oral histories, court records, and local histories as well as quantitative sources like census data and parish records.</p>
<p>The collection is structured in two sections that demonstrate, through complementary approaches, how the diverse and intersecting worlds of women and slavery can be discovered. The first section comprises pioneering individual case studies. One essay, for example, uses racist sources to shed light on a former slave woman's major contribution to the South's internal rebellions against the Confederacy. Another discusses a mistress who, by her own initiative, first became a slave owner while her husband was at war. In the second section, which presents group studies, one finds equally pathbreaking explorations of such topics as the religious experience and culture of early slave women and also the clothing and self-adornment of enslaved and free African American women as material culture artifacts and evidence. All of the essays in the collection point to additional sources for study and research.</p>
<p>Reconstructing the histories of women who struggled to shape their own lives and who, in the context of slavery and its legacies, often struggled tragically against each other, this collection richly contributes to the humanization of America's slavery past.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.2499815 Inches, Length: 6.12498775 Inches, Weight: 1.0692419707 Pounds, Width: 0.90999818 Inches",30.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/71/9780820317571.jpg,Success,90,18.4
