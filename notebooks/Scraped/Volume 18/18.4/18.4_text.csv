AUSCHWITZ
A Doctor's Story
Lucie Adelsberger, M.D.
Foreword by Deborah E. Lipstadt
Historical advice and annotations by Arthur J. Slavin
“A taut, terse Holocaust narrative that is all the more
powerful for its ironic reserve.” — Kirkus Reviews
Now available in English for the first time, this
moving memoir by a physician who survived the
horrors of the Nazi death camp is one of the few
testimonies to give voice to the experience of
women at Auschwitz.
“Doctor Adelsberger, to her magnificent credit, writes
about Auschwitz exactly as it was. I honor her for
honoring the six million with the truth.”
— Isabella Leitner

Vahm-e-Sabz, a 27-year-old Iranian lesbian femi-
nist poet, was granted political asylum on Wednesday,
October 18, by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, on the grounds that she would be persecuted
if she returned to her country. Sabz faces the possibil-
ity of execution in her native Iran because she is a
lesbian and an outspoken feminist and advocate for
women’s rights.
A rape crisis and violence reduction counselor,
Sabz has been involved with many women’s organi-
zations, is a member of the Iranian Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Network, and has been involved with the
International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Com-
mission (IGLHRC).
Sabz is also the author of a chapter in an IGLHRC
human rights report that documents the extent of
persecution against Iranian lesbians who must con-
tend with strict anti-lesbian interpretations of Islamic
belief by the Iranian government.
“I hope that my case will not be used to perpetuate
the existing anti-Iranian sentiments, but instead will
assist other lesbians who are living in fear of persecution
and are seeking asylum,” Sabz said in a press statement.

look at something, they just had to let someone
know what they were doing.”
Across the country, other women’s and
lesbian centers were following suit. Margaret
Johnston, a member of the feminist booksell-
ing community, explains how the two
institutions evolved in almost symbiotic man-
ner. “They were highly mimetic. As women
had a safe place to explore the politics of fem-
inism, they began to write about it. When they
wrote fiction and lesbian nonfiction, publish-
ing companies owned by feminist collectives
evolved to fill the need, as did women’s book-
stores and printers. Women’s centers were
having a hard time paying the rent and
thought selling books would help. That’s why
there are several bookstores, publications,
publishers, and centers all celebrating their
25th anniversaries over the next few years.”
In Minneapolis, though, Brown and
Hanson eventually realized that “Amaon
wouldn't survive without a storefront.”

LESBIAN FICTION... surprised when they actually realized what it was.”
That location was the first of several unsafe neighbor-
hoods and several bone-chilling winters for the
collective members and volunteers who staffed the
bookstore in the early years.
Still, like other bookstores across the continent, it
was an exciting place to be. The bookstores of the 70s
were often the hub of the community, doubling as
bookstore and lesbian center. “I had just come out, and
it was really exciting,” Como recalls. She doesn’t gloss
over the hard work or rough conditions of Amazon's
first years, though, adding that “the back room leaked,
and you had to wear double the clothes in the winter
to stay warm.” The heating would be an ongoing
problem. In the Hennepin store, the last before
Amazon found its present home on the north side of
Loring Park in 1985, there were also leaks and no heat.
“It was impossible for people to be warm,” Como goes
on. “But they worked anyway...with fans and space

By Suzanne
Two Sisters Bookshop /Menlo Park CA
When my sister and I opened the bookstore
seven years ago, we didn’t know much, but we did
know we wanted to carry sidelines. Besides being
fun, þeautiful and interesting, we knew the 50%
margin would help offset the 40% we'd make on
books. The first year was 50/50 books and sidelines.
Two years later we were 40% books and 60% side-
lines. That percentage has held now for about five
years. I don’t do anything to manage it one way or
the other. I regularly choose new gift items and
eliminate slow-moving book categories and side-
lines. I do get a pit in my stomach at the thought of
our books decreasing. It doesn’t matter if sales are
great, it’s an identity problem for me. The bookstore
was my sister's idea, so when I start straying seri-
ously far from the original idea, I have to soothe my
anxiety. I wander around the store admiring how Painting by Deborah A. Bowman, from the '96 Luna

that there's a lot of love around our sidelines. Our
customers describe our displays as altars everywhere

growing, lesbian erotic publications were beginning a Some other
dramatic improvement in both volume and variety.

The Other Side of Silence: Women Tell About
Their Experience with Date Rape edited by Christine
Carter reveals the pain of being violated by someone
thought to be trustworthy. This book collects personal
accounts presenting the views of survivors — per-
spectives that are often misunderstood if they are
heard at all. The Other Side of Silence addresses the
elements of date rape and how it differs from stranger
rape and examines how American culture builds and
reinforces behavior that can lead to rape. The book
also presents the findings of health educators and
sexual assault experts who examine the socialization
of women and men, highlight exemplary programs,
and recommend a path for change. $19.95 cl, 0-

“Eleven presidents and four wars ago Louise Rosenblatt gave us her magnum opus,
Literature as Exploration. Since its publication in 1938 it has remained one of the most
widely read books on literature and its teaching—an extraordinary feat of endurance.
Written in an accessible, jargon-free style, it eloquently escorts the reader to a place where
transactions with literature become personally crafted moments of discovery.”
TEACHING AND LEARNING LITERATURE
Literature as
Exploration
Fifth edition • Louise M. Rosenblatt
Foreword by Wayne Booth
January 1996
Advertising in major literary reviews and scholarly journals
6x9 xx & 319 pp. ` Index
Trade paperback ISBN 0-87352-568-X © $12.50
Available from Ingram Book Company
In Literature as Exploration, Louise Rosenblatt presents
her unique and influential theory of literature and
focuses on the immense, often untapped, potential
for the study and teaching of literature in a democra-
tic society. First published in 1938, Rosenblatt’s clas-
sic is reissued here with a new foreword by Wayne
Booth, a new preface and retrospective chapter by the
author, and an updated list of suggested readings.
During the last decade, Literature as Exploration
sold more than 15,000 copies, confirming its status as
one of the most durable works of literary theory of
modern times. Owners of the previous, mass-market
edition will want to purchase this special inexpensive
trade edition, with its attractive cover, larger format,
elegant typography, and new supporting materials.
Students, teachers, and scholars reading the book for
_ the first time will be as enlightened and challenged as
previous generations have been by this enduring work.
Louise M. Rosenblatt is professor emerita of New York University, where she taught comparative literature
and literary theory while developing a doctoral program in English. She is the author of The Reader, the Text,
the Poem: The Transactional Theory of the Literary Work (1978; Southern Illinois UP, 1994) and recently contributed
an essay for Writing Theory and Critical Theory (MLA, 1994). She lives in Princeton and is working on a book about
contemporary theories of communication.

Enthusiasm for the Inland purchase was high
among the Koen staff that FBN interviewed. Bob
Koen summed it up saying, “Bringing these Inland
publishers aboard will make them available to a
wider range of customers, making their books more
accessible to everyone. In a like fashion, Inland cus-
tomers will be able to consolidate their orders
through Koen and purchase...everything from main-
stream bestsellers to academic studies. It is a
continuation of the direction we have been tracking
all along: making every book possible accessible to
everyone. [The Inland purchase] expands what we
can offer, and it expands the audience we reach, all
in one fell swoop.”
The sale of Inland assets to Koen will earn
Inland /Connecticut, an estimated $150,000.
Koen is not acquiring InBook or WomanSource.
The sale of both InBook and WomanSource to Login
(see News) is progressing. If the Login sale goes
through, InBook and WomanSource will be moved to
Login’s Chicago facility and will continue to exist as
entities within the Logan superstructure.

$150/retail. Titles ordered in multiples of 5-9 copies
