0-8032-7956-6,Tomorrow's Tomorrow: The Black Woman,"Ladner, Joyce A.",University of Nebraska Press,306,8/1/1995,,Paperback,"<i>Tomorrow’s Tomorrow</i> is a pioneering sociological study of black girls growing up in the city. The author, in a substantial new introduction, considers what has changed and what has remained constant for them since the book was first published in 1971.&nbsp;Joyce A. Ladner spent four years interviewing, observing, and socializing with more than a hundred girls living in the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis. She was challenged by preconceived academic ideas and labels and by her own past as a black child in rural Mississippi. Rejecting the white middle-class perspective of “deviant” behavior, she examined the expectations and aspirations of these representative black girls and their feelings about parents and boyfriends, marriage, pregnancy, and child-rearing.&nbsp;Ladner asked what life was like in the urban black community for the “average” girl, how she defined her roles and behaviors, and where she found her role models. She was interested in any significant disparity between aspirations and the resources to achieve them. To what extent did the black teenager share the world of her white peers? If the questions were searching, the conclusions were provocative. According to Ladner, “The total misrepresentation of the Black community and the various myths which surround it can be seen in microcosm in the Black female adolescent.”",en,REPRINT,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.85098433132 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/68/9780803279568.jpg,Success,98,18.5

Her most recent assignment? Trying to stop the naked protesters running through the Berkeley hills, decrying the recent city ordinance against nudity. Flagging one of them down, she runs smack into Bryn Wiley - ex-Olympic diver, owner of a thriving neighborhood health club, and local legend. Bryn knows a cop when she sees one, and she distracts Jill from the matter at hand by immediately issuing a vandalism complaint. The likely suspect? Hostile sixties radical Sam Johnson. Along with his old grudges, Sam now has a competing gym of his own. And a $400,000 house in the hills next door to Bryn's that he's noisily renovating. But fellow neighbor Karl Pironnen - a reclusive loner with a passion for chess and large dogs - is not exactly a friend to the cops either. And there are all those angry nudists, streaking around au naturel. The stakes turn unexpectedly serious when someone is shot at close range. On the heels of her unearned demotion, Jill now must seek a murderer as bitter and burned out as she sometimes feels herself.

When Detective Jill Smith is called upon to put a stop to a slew of naked protesters, she soon finds herself halted by a much larger crime: the founder of a local gym is shot at close range, and Jill must find out why.

Still a Hollywood literary agent and still a beleaguered single mom, she's also still at war with her own mother, Edwina, who just happens to be an already volatile personality made even more so by the onset of her ""change of life."" But are Edwina's hormonal fluctuations enough to make her homicidal? Exasperated but loyal, Charlie's sure the answer is no - yet out on a remote stretch of Utah desert, where the two women find themselves in the middle of warring film crews, such truths aren't as clear as they might be closer to civilization and such things as hot baths and working telephones. A biologist whose area of specialization is rats, Edwina has no patience whatsoever with the two-legged variety. And schlock horror film director Gordon Cabot, with his brutal disregard for the plants and creatures currently serving as background for his costly special effects, certainly fulfills her definition. So when he turns up quite seriously dead, the local sheriff is more than willing to take Edwina at her word: the delicate desert ecosystem is far more valuable than any single human life. Thus, Charlie's problem is how to get her mother out of jail...and herself out of Utah and back to work negotiating deals that don't involve capital crimes. But at the same time Romance, in the person of swoon-making movie star Mitch Hilsten, long one of Charlie's fantasy heros, offers unusual opportunities for diversion from daughterly duty.

                        <p>Charlie Greene, last seen in Death of the Office Witch matching disembodied voices to discarded corpses, is back! In Murder in a Hot Flash, Charlie's mother, Edwina, has been accused of murder. And Charlie is off to Utah to help clear her name.

In a quieter, but equally vital arena, women have been wielding their influence in the business world for some time. Yet, their accomplishments go largely unnoticed by the press, robbing the public in general - and aspiring women in particular - of much needed role-models. On Our Own Terms fills the information vacuum by providing a look into the lives of fifteen highly successful business women. The women selected represent a cross-section of American women in ethnicity, age, geography, and business experience. All of these women have had to make sacrifices to meet the challenges along their diverse routes to leadership. Rather than relying on the traditional business school model of how to succeed in the workplace, each of these women has invented her own path to success by drawing on the unique resources available to her - from her natural talents, instincts, and passions, to family values, ethnic heritage, and distinctive approaches to business and life.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>The 15 women executives profiled here are intended as role models, so they are seen primarily through their own eyes. About half of each entry consists of direct quotes from the profilee. These are interspersed with comments by the authors (Enkelis is a photographer, Olsen an art director, Lewenstein an editor), with flattering photographs taken by Enkelis. Some names, such as Wilma Mankiller, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, may be familiar from the news, but most will not. These women have encountered problems such as divorce, difficulty in obtaining financing, or being discounted due to their gender, but the emphasis is on success and what they have done right. Coverage spans a variety of industries, including nonprofit. The graphics quality is noteworthy.

In Fact There Were Black Pubs And Clubs, Balls For Blacks Only, Black Churches, And Organizations For Helping Blacks Out Of Work Or In Trouble. Many Blacks Were Prosperous And Respected: George Bridgtower Was A Concert Violinist Who Knew Beethoven; Ignatius Sancho Corresponded With Laurence Sterne; Francis Williams Studied At Cambridge. Others, Like Jack Beef, Were Successful Stewards Or Men Of Business. But Many More Were Servants Or Beggars, Some Turning To Prostitution Or Theft. Alongside The Free Black World Was Slavery, From Which Many Of These People Escaped. In Particular, It Was The Business Of Kidnapping Blacks For Export To The West Indies That Made Granville Sharp An Abolitionist And Brought The Celebrated Somerset Case Before Lord Justice Mansfield. Those Men Are Now Heroes Of Human Rights, Yet Sharp Probably Did Not Believe In Racial Equality; And Mansfield, Whose Own Much-loved Great-niece Was Black, Was So Worried About Property Rights That He Did All He Could To Avoid A Judgment That Would Set Blacks Free.

Listen to their stories - of moving beyond fears of aging and changing, of learning to steer their own course and discovering a new sense of freedom and power. Funny and poignant, savvy and intimately personal, Red Hot Mamas doesn't skirt the issues. Colette Dowling's account of her own midlife transition is bracingly honest about the challenges of growing older as a woman in our society - from the politics of appearance to the need to come to grips, once and for all, with money issues, and the family pressures created by older parents and departing children. But whether she's discussing the latest scientific debates over hormone replacement, the risks of career change at fifty, or strategies for midlife sexual satisfaction, she gives readers the information they need to make life-changing decisions - and to comfort the really big questions: What is the most exciting and fruitful way I can make use of the next thirty or forty years? Where, how, and in whose company shall I spend them? and How can I best protect my options and harness my energy?

There are insights from experts from New York's Hetrick-Martin institute, Los Angeles's Project 10, and Minneapolis's District 202 Teen Center, as well as the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, P-FLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and the American Psychiatric Association. Their findings are often sobering: A 1986 study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on Youth Suicide stated that ""gay youth are 2 to 3 times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people."" The National Advocacy Coalition on Youth and Sexual Orientation found that 86 percent of secondary-school students said they would be upset if they were labeled gay or lesbian. The Seattle Commission for Lesbians and Gays reported that 75 percent of those surveyed had been physically or verbally assaulted.

Then she discovers that a young woman, Kadi Hopkirk, has been hiding in her junk closet for two days. Kadi spills out an improbable story - that since a chance meeting with a childhood friend she has been followed by persons unknown in a sinister van. She's convinced that the henchmen inside are hellbent on finding her. A little experiment on Mrs. P's part proves at least this part of the story correct.<P>Kadi soon confides the rest of the story - a close tie with an assassinated foreign president and an item in her possession that makes both her and our sleuth moving targets for - someone. When Mrs. P puts in a call for help to her old CIA crony Carstairs, he's wrapped up in the kidnap of a wealthy financier. Before she knows it, what began as a dash for safety and a call for help expands into an assignment that leads to hair-trigger violence in exotic places.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In her 10th adventure, the observant and unflappable Mrs. P. discovers a young woman hiding in a closet of her Connecticut home on the same day that she observes a suspicious white van patrolling the neighborhood. Kadi Hopkirk says the men in the van have been following her ever since she met Sammy, a childhood friend from the African country of Ubangiba, in New Haven, where he told her he was being guarded and secretly gave something for safekeeping. Mrs. Pollifax hides Kadi in the car and takes to the highway but is unable to shake the van until she calls on two former colleagues at the CIA, who send a helicopter to whisk them away to a traveling carnival in rural Maine. Mrs. Pollifax, last seen in Mrs. Pollifax and the Second Thief (1994), poses as a journalist, and Kadi becomes the lower half of the woman who is sawed in two, while the CIA pals find out who Sammy is and why he is being so heavily guarded. Like a magician pulling a rabbit from a hat, Gilman, a deft stylist, adroitly resolves her plot's mysteries, finally bringing together a stabbing at the carnival, Kadi and Sammy's story and the abduction of a wealthy executive.

Introduction by the Author.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>As the number of regional and thematic anthologies swells to meet academic and general demand, it also threatens any sense of a cumulative American literature. Only a rare editor of Mee's talents can pull together such an exclusive collection of stories and render them inclusive in their broader human concerns. Featuring work by such contemporary Southern celebrities as Ellen Gilchrist, Lee Smith, Bobbie Ann Mason and Dorothy Allison, and such established icons as Zora Neale Huston, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter and Flannery O'Connor, Mee's collection shines a light on the concerns of women born and raised below the Mason-Dixon line. Using seven thematic sections which address ``The Pleasures and Miseries of Marriage'' or ``Settings, Customs, and Artifacts,'' Mee reveals how experience tends toward a certain commonality that transcends time, race, and religion when the land itself seems to keep a grip on its history. ``Full voice, all out, late evening gospel music filled the car and shocked passing traffic,'' says the narrator of Allison's ``Gospel Song.'' The same could be said for Downhome, except Mee (The Girl Who Loved Elvis) hasn't constructed her chorus of voices to strike up a mystical religious fervor. Instead, these stories haunt the reader with their intimacy, their language, and their keen eye for the telling detail.

From its offices to its boardrooms, heterosexuality is continuously on display: alluded to in conversation and family photos, symbolized by wedding rings, and endorsed by personnel policies that award benefits to spouses and children. For the estimated ten percent of the population that is gay, including the millions of gay professionals in the corporate world, the ""sexual culture"" of these organizations forces a series of difficult choices. Now, drawing on hundreds of interviews with men all across the country and in different kinds of companies, from chief executives to recent college graduates, James Woods explores the professional lives of gay men and the various strategies they have developed for managing sexual identity at work. Whether they disguise their sexuality, reveal it, or try to avoid the subject altogether, each choice has its consequences and benefits and has profound implications for their careers, their companies, and their colleagues. This pathbreaking book explores the significance of each alternative, and in tracing the process by which gay men make the choice it illuminates the stressful realities of gay life in corporate America. In the short run, it is the men's self-esteem, productivity, and job satisfaction that suffer from the struggle of accommodating to heterosexual norms. But in the long run, the sexual culture of the workplace affects all professionals. Woods' fascinating inquiry explores the dynamics of sexuality in professional life and the way it shapes our own self-definitions, values, and most deeply held ideas about work. As the workplace becomes increasingly diverse, it is time for us to look more closely at the boundaries between the sexual and the professional, and the many ways in which these worlds overlap.",en,Reprint,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/43/9780029356043.jpg,Success,71,18.5

This new collection of documents - letters, songs, poetry, diary extracts - charts the visions that inspired women and the obstacles that confronted them. Exploring twentieth-century Australia, Freedom Bound II shows how intertwined were women's public and personal lives, and how bound by custom, ties, affections and duties. The different meanings of freedom have been shaped by the nature of women's oppression, their quests given focus by their different points of departure. Aboriginal women sought self-determination and the right to keep their children; migrant women sought to affirm culture and family ties, and escape discrimination and poverty. Overburdened mothers wanted relief from continual childbearing and a measure of self-fulfillment. Numerous women have campaigned for freedom from domestic tyranny and male violence. Together with its companion volume, Freedom Bound I, which deals with the period of colonisation, this volume documents the dreams that inspired women, the pleasures and pain that informed their politics and the desires that enthralled them, even as they bade them to be free.

Tracing the roles of working women from the Colonial Era to the present, Harris describes a powerful push-pull dynamic between mothers and daughters.

This collection of stories, originally published in Lebanon as <i>Ala La'ihat al-Intizar</i>, is the most recent of her five publications. Her stories intimately reflect women's experiences in the chaotic worlds of the Lebanese civil war and the rise of Saadam Hussain as Iraq's leader. Set in Iraq, Cyprus, and Lebanon, the stories shed light on an unusual Middle East refugee experience—that of a cultural refugee, a divorced woman who is educated, affluent, and alone.
<p>Al-Amir is also a poet and novelist, whose sensual prose grows out of a long tradition of Iraqi poetry. But one also finds existential themes in her works, as Al-Amir tries to balance what seems fated and what seems arbitrary in the turbulent world she inhabits. She deals with time and space in a minimalist, surreal style, while studying the disappointments of life through the subjective lens of memory. Honestly facing the absence of family and the instability of place, Al-Amir gives lifelike qualities to the inanimate objects of her rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>In addition to the stories, two examples of the author's experimental poems are included. In her introduction, Mona Mikhail places these stories and poems in the context of contemporary Islamic literature and gender studies.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.28880556322 Pounds, Width: 0.2 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/74/9780292790674.jpg,Success,45,18.5

Soon ardent lovers, Nell and Gauguin depart for life in cities (including New York and its Jewish deli delights). But passion cools with marriage, ridiculous in-laws and the prospect of daily reality in ``Minneapolis, for good.'' Gauguin turns unconvincingly bossy and square, annoyed by Nell's caf art show, her carefree ``women's libber'' ways and her Jewishness, which she fiercely protects amid the alien Midwestern corn. For solace, Nell turns to Anna Gates, whose mountaintop funeral opens and closes the novel as a frame and comment on the Gauguin/Nell relationship. In life, Anna was willowy and fair, a writer of guileless little sketches and ``a six-foot-one-inch lesbian'' whom Nell had tenderly loved but slept with only once. Finally, Nell's painful losses spur her to redemptive literary activity. Sentence by sentence, Goldberg's writing is, not surprisingly, sensitive and quick, but her plot meanders like a sleepy bee, settling down now and then for a scene as sweet as nectar but too often simply buzzing around in the air.

Change - the movement from one life structure to the next - is, as Levinson has said, part of the nature of our existence. Almost half our adult life is spent in developmental transitions, and these are almost invariably difficult, sometimes agonizing. Yet if the developmental timetable is surprisingly similar in men and women - and this fact is one of Levinson's principal new findings - The Seasons of a Woman's Life also illuminates a number of profound differences. Many relate to the phenomenon of gender splitting, the rigid division between male and female, masculine and feminine, that has existed throughout history. In an epochal shift, this division is now being eroded. But the shape of women's lives, and the circumstances of their passages through the phases of adult development, are still uniquely affected by gender issues. This emerges with poignant clarity from the stories told by the women interviewed here.                        <p>Firmly grounded in scientific research, this book reveals that women follow a predictable developmental course through adulthood. Work and marriage relationships, personal crisis, emotional states, and behavior can all be related to this grand pattern. But in the case of women, the situation is made far more complicated by gender biases.</p>",en,1,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.55 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/56/9780394532356.jpg,Success,110,18.5

Three days later, her body, badly bruised and waterlogged, was found floating in the shallow waters of the Hudson River just a few feet from the Jersey shore. A long celebrated unsolved mystery, this case became the subject of endless commentary and speculation in the new penny press and the popular novel, and received its most famous exposition in Edgar Allan Poe's pioneering detective story The Mystery of Marie Roget. <p>In <i>The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers</i>, historian Amy Gilman Srebnick brilliantly recaptures the story of Mary Rogers, showing how Rogers represented an emerging class of urban women and how her death became a touchstone for mid-nineteenth century concerns over sexual license, the changing roles of women, law and order, and abortion. Rogers' death, first thought due to a murderous gang of rapists and later tacitly understood to be the result of an ill-performed abortion, quickly became a source of popular entertainment, a topic of political debate, and an inspiration to public policy, including the 1845 New York State law criminalizing abortion. The incident and the city's response to it provides a fascinating window into the urban culture and consciousness of the mid-1800s.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.56 inches, Length: 6.5 inches, Weight: 1.28 Pounds, Width: 0.878 inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/73/9780195062373.jpg,Success,95,18.5

For the first time, Gilmartin reveals the extent to which revolutionaries in the 1920s were committed to women's emancipation and the radical political efforts that were made to overcome women's subordination and to transform gender relations.<br>
Women activists whose experiences and achievements have been previously ignored are brought to life in this study, which illustrates how the Party functioned not only as a political organization but as a subculture for women as well. We learn about the intersection of the personal and political lives of male communists and how this affected their beliefs about women's emancipation. Gilmartin depicts with thorough and incisive scholarship how the Party formulated an ideological challenge to traditional gender relations while it also preserved aspects of those relationships in its organization.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",33.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/64/9780520203464.jpg,Success,97,18.5

Instead, One By One African Americans Began Returning To Some Of The Least Promising Places, Places The Department Of Agriculture Calls Persistent Poverty Counties. In Call To Home, Carol Stack Tells Us Why. Here Are The Stories Of People Trading Their Apartments In The City For Trailers, Old Cabins, Or Brick Houses Built Along Dusty Southern Back Roads. Some Were Pushed Rather Than Drawn Back By Rootlessness, Joblessness, And Urban Decay. Others, Made Stronger By The Uncompromising Demands Of City Life, Came Home Determined To Apply The Hard Lessons They'd Learned Up North To Build New Lives In The South. Still Others Returned To Recover What They Had Lost. Children Often Were Sent Home First, Either To Be Cared For Or To Help Care For Grandparents Who Never Left. Call To Home Is The Story Of Hardships - Of Starting Over, Of Poverty, Of Rural Life - But Is Also The Story Of Success, Of How People Determined To Build Real Communities And To Set Things Right Helped To Establish The Right Of Black Americans To Participate As Full Citizens In The American South.

Dykes, Jr., Oakland University</I><p>From the introduction&#58;<BR> This book was put together to reclaim, and to create heightened awareness about, individuals, contributions, and struggles that have made African-American survival and progress possible. We cannot accurately comprehend either our hidden potential or the full range of problems that besiege us until we know about the successful struggles that generations of foremothers waged against virtually insurmountable obstacles. We can, and will, chart a coherent future and win essential opportunities with a clear understanding of the past in all its pain and glory.</p><p>Here, in a single volume, is a sweeping panorama of black women's experience throughout history and across classes and continents. Containing over 30 crucial essays by the most influential and prominent scholars in the field, including Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Linda Gordon, and Nell Irvin Painter, <B>We Specialize in the Wholly Impossible</B> is a comprehensive assessment of black women's lives. <p>The book is divided into six sections&#58; theory; Africa; the Caribbean and Canada; 18th-century United States; 19th-century United States; and 20th-century United States. A remarkably diverse range of topics are covered, with chapters on such subjects as working-class consciousness among Afro-American women; the impact of slavery on family structure; black women missionaries in South Africa; slavery, sharecropping, and sexual inequality; black women during the American Revolution; imprisoned black women in the American West; women's welfare activism; SNCC and black women's activism; andproperty-owning free African-American women in the 19th-century South. </p><br></p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Similar in format to the other volumes of the series, this book is a collection of 32 scholarly articles, most reprinted from journals since 1989. The first dozen articles address theory in black women's history and black women in Africa, Canada, and the Caribbean, while the bulk of the essays concentrates on black women in 18th-through 20th-century American history. The quotation in the title was a motto of a training school for black women. Hine also edited the well-received Black Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia (LJ 2/15/93). A shorter, older reader, Ellen Dubois's Unequal Sisters (Routledge, 1990), offers articles not only on African American women but other minority women as well.

The attack tore away her childhood and irrevocably changed her world - a change she would spend many years pretending never happened. <i>Where I Stopped</i> is a compassionate rendering of Martha the young girl, as she lives through rape and its repercussions in her life, and Martha the adult, as she turns to face the meaning of her memories. As a girl, Martha had to cope with her family's shock and with the inept responses of teachers and schoolmates. She survived the insensitivity of the police when they had her reenact the moment of the attack, in an attempt to identify a suspect. She testified in an open courtroom. And she tried, without guidance from anyone, to make sense of what the rapist did. As the years passed, Ramsey told herself that the rape had caused her no lasting harm. She grew up to pursue a rewarding life as a published poet and teacher. She made a happy marriage. But she had chronic doubts. Did she help convict the wrong man? Might she have brought the rape on herself by inviting it somehow? Did it damage her sexuality? She tried to ignore her recurrent childlike cravings for help and love. Twenty years later, her unease finally compels her to examine her memories and attempt to understand what really happened. With gripping suspense and poignancy, this powerful memoir conveys the peculiar way the psyche resists knowing what it has suffered from sexual abuse, and what it is like to arrive haltingly at a truthful connection with one's own history. The first autobiography to address adolescent rape compellingly, <i>Where I Stopped</i> is indispensable reading for anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of rape, how to come to terms with it, and how to be of help.

Now, with Among Women, Bianchi proves himself equal to the task of capturing women's relationships - between friends, between mother and daughter, between sisters, between lovers - in all their affectionate and generous love. In collaboration with the women in this book, Bianchi has thrown out the old cliches and roles into which women are usually cast and broken new ground in this exploration of the female nude. By inviting these women to be portrayed as they wished to be seen, Bianchi provided them a comfortable stage on which to be themselves and, as a result, was rewarded with wonderfully varied and compellingly rich portraits. Marked by an independent spirit and the subjects' confident strength in their physical presence, the work in Bianchi's Among Women is perhaps his strongest to date.

At pride marches, in films such as Go Fish, at academic conferences, the role and status of bisexuals is hotly contested.</p>
<p>Within lesbian communities, formed to support lesbians in a patriarchal and heterosexist society, bisexual women are often perceived as a threat or as a political weakness. Bisexual women feel that they are regarded with suspicion and distrust, if not openly scorned. Drawing on her research with over 400 bisexual and lesbian women, surveying the treatment of bisexuality in the lesbian and gay press, and examining the recent growth of a self-consciously political bisexual movement, Paula Rust addresses a range of questions pertaining to the political and social relationships between lesbians and bisexual women.</p>
<p>By tracing the roots of the controversy over bisexuality among lesbians back to the early lesbian feminist debates of the 1970s, Rust argues that those debates created the circumstances in which bisexuality became an inevitable challenge to lesbian politics. She also traces it forward, predicting the future of sexual politics.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.13097140406 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/58/9780814774458.jpg,Success,29,18.5

A brightly illustrated, bilingual picture book, Pepita Talks Twice/Pepita habla dos veces depicts an active young girl's frustration at being stopped constantly to translate for neighbors, relatives and classmates. Her decision to stop speaking Spanish leads to problems she had not anticipated, including not being able to communicate with her beloved grandmother who speaks only Spanish and with her dog Lobo, who refuses to come to her when she calls him by his English name, Wolf. It is only when Lobo's life is in danger that she comes to fully appreciate the value of her bilingual skills.
<p>Pepita Talks Twice/Pepito habla dos veces will delight both English- and Spanish-speakers and give them insight into the value of speaking two languages. Both dialogue and illustrations are delightful in capturing the full flavor of biculturalism.</p>

Many of the pieces are confessional, but readers (or readers likely to buy this book) will find that the guilt, the disapproval, not to mention the mechanics, sound familiar. Some writing is jargon-filled (``culturally I am woman-identified''; ``I told Becky it was a little hard for me to be nonreductive'') or just bad (``maybe she's desirous in general currently and I'm receptive to desirousness.''). There is some good writing: notably Lisa Palac's delightful, bemused description of sexual experimentation through the personals and Guinevere Turner's touching account of a chance encounter with a woman who shared her childhood in a commune. Two straight women, perhaps because they are outsiders among outsiders, give very clear readings of social and political complications: Ann Powers discusses the muddled issue of straight women committed to queer politics, while Daphne Merkin is painfully honest in her opinion that male homosexuality has a greater validity than lesbianism: ``When I think of two women together, I think of it as the default position... I have no doubt that somewhere in this assessment floats a sadder, more insidious piece of reality, having to do with the way women continue to be perceived by society at large and how we in turn assess one another.''

Would-be biographers were held at arm's length, and any so foolhardy as to persevere found doors slammed and projects aborted. Only Hazel Rowley managed to stay the course, persuading Stead's estate as well as her friends, colleagues, and family members to cooperate, thereby gaining access to private papers and privileged memories. The result is an intellectually rigorous yet dramatically riveting book that brings alive this odd and furious woman who was often her own worst enemy but who stands with very few as one of the truly important literary figures of her age. Born in Australia in 1902, Christina Stead sailed for England at the age of twenty-six, not to return home until she was seventy-two. An intensely private person and an incredibly cantankerous one, Stead lived a life that was stormy, eccentric, and brave. She was highly political and maddeningly contentious - few would call her easy in life or in fiction. And yet, in her lifetime, her work was likened to that of Balzac, Joyce, Ibsen, and Tolstoy. But, in fact, it was uniquely her own.",en,,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.85 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/27/9780805042627.jpg,Success,109,18.5

Instead, Plant calls Hurston a writer of resistance who challenged the politics of domination both in her life and in her work. One of the great geniuses of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston stands out as a strong voice for African American women. Her anthropological inquiries as well as her evocative prose provide today's readers with a rich history of African American folk culture - a folk culture through which Hurston expressed her personal and political strategy of resistance and self-empowerment. Through readings of Hurston's fiction and autobiographical writings, Plant offers one of the first book-length discussions of Hurston's personal philosophy of individualism and self-reliance. From a discussion of Hurston's preacher father and influential mother, whose guiding philosophy is reflected in the title of this book, to the influence of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Plant puts into perspective the driving forces behind Hurston's powerful prose.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/31/9780252021831.jpg,Success,97,18.5

Psychologists and scholars can benefit from Meredith Kimball’s analysis and the tensions she creates because they ultimately broaden feminist visions. She informs the political analysis of those working on the inside and those on the outside of feminism to end all forms of discrimination and oppression.</p>
<p>In opening the dialogue between the two traditions, Kimball</p>
<ul>
<li>presents a brief history of gender research and equal-rights feminisms in the early twentieth century, with an in-depth analysis of the work of Leta Stetter Hollingworth.</li>
<li>analyzes women’s experience in and feminist critiques of science and technology.</li>
<li>analyzes research on gender-related similarities and differences in mathematics achievement.</li>
<li>presents a brief history of psychoanalytic gender theory and maternal feminisms in the early twentieth century, with an in-depth analysis of the work of Karen Horney.</li>
<li>analyzes Kohlberg’s and Gilligan’s models of moral development.</li>
<li>gives a broad overview and analysis of women’s caregiving in North America and cross-culturally in motherist-based political movements.
<p>The educated reader, whether actively involved in feminism or the general political arena, can apply the non-reductionist political analysis to their own theories and research. Because all oppressed groups face dilemmas of integrating into the dominant culture versus changing the dominant culture, members of these groups will appreciate the over-arching political analysis that forms the theme of Feminist Visions of Gender Similarities and Differences.</p>

At the same time, a steadily growing number of companies seek to attract and cultivate talented employees regardless of their sexual orientation. These companies and their employees have found they share a common cause in their search for the most productive and creative of work environments. This guide includes strategies for both, as well as an illuminating evaluation of 100 of the most gay-friendly companies - including large, small, nonprofit, publicly held, privately owned, and public agencies, in a wide variety of industries coast to coast. Companies are ranked as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" or ""trying,"" based on both hard data and more subtle criteria regarding attitudes and social pressures. The 100 Best Companies For Gay Men and Lesbians offers a thoughtful explanation of gay and lesbian workplace issues, including: coming out - should you do it? when? how? what are the risks? the advantages?; discrimination and harassment - whether lesbian and gay employees receive equality in promotion and compensation, how companies do (or don't) respond to claims, and whether employees feel safe enough to make claims; domestic partner benefits - what are they? what do they really cost the company? what are the different approaches that various companies use?; finding and working with allies - labor unions, employee associations, individual managers, and more. For gay men and lesbians just starting out in the working world, for those contemplating career changes, for corporate managers, career counselors, recruiters and educators, for socially conscious investors, and for all those interested in harmonious and dynamic workplaces, The 100 Best Companies For Gay Men and Lesbians is essential reading.

                        <p>Mickens' invaluable guide examines the problems and challenges faced by gay professionals in today's workplace, from discrimination and harassment to unequal compensation and more.

But, as Nadine Strossen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, forcefully argues, this view of sexuality as inherently dangerous does profound damage to human rights in general, and to women's rights in particular. In Defending Pornography, Strossen shows that, since the late 1970s, a new and startling alliance has been fused between procensorship feminists, most notably Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, and conservatives, many of whom oppose women's rights causes. Together they are campaigning against a wide range of sexually oriented expression, including not only art and literature, but also materials concerning abortion, contraception, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, sexism, and sexual orientation. One of America's most visible and articulate advocates of both feminism and free speech, Strossen is in the vanguard of an increasingly vocal group of feminist women who adamantly oppose any effort to censor sexual expression. Women's rights, Strossen demonstrates, are far more endangered by censorship than by sexual words or images. Strossen eloquently argues that women do not have to choose between speech and equality, between dignity and sexuality, between safety and our freedoms to read, think, speak, sing, write, paint, dance, dream, photograph, film, and fantasize as we wish. Offering a feminist's unique perspective on the history of obscenity laws, she shows that censorship has long been - and continues to be - used as a tool to repress information vital to women's equality, health, and reproductive autonomy. As Defending Pornography makes devastatingly clear, those who would restrict freedom of expression ultimately restrict women's rights.                        <p>The president of the American Civil Liberties Union explains why censoring pornography undermines women's rights. Strossen claims that free speech and women's rights are not at odds--if we protect the law from the forces that would limit our constitutional right to free expression.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/31/9780385481731.jpg,Success,104,18.5

As the only woman leader of the Industrial Workers of the World she organized immigrant factory workers in the East, iron ore miners on Minnesota's Mesabi Range, and lumberjacks in the Northwest.

Lesbians are often overlooked or under-represented in both academic research and popular literature, as they suffer from the double discrimination of both homophobia and sexism.

It also shows how to identify other areas in which research is needed.

<ul>
<li>a literature review of research conducted about lesbians and lesbianism from 1950—1990</li>
<li>an examination of single-subject design use for evaluating psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men</li>
<li>an exploration of the feminist participatory model for studying partner abuse in lesbian relationships</li>
<li>methodological issues associated with conducting research with older lesbians</li>
<li>an analysis of ethical dilemmas associated with conducting research in lesbian communities</li>
<li>fusion and conflict resolution in lesbian relationships
<p>Each chapter contains an excellent reference list to help the novice and the experienced scholar continue the development of research that provides valid and reliable data on and about lesbians.

Growing up in a refugee family, Estes learns the art of storytelling in the ancient tradition. In graceful prose, she relates the story of her Hungarian Uncle Zovar, a concentration camp survivor, in his struggle to release himself from the horrors of camp life. A story within a story is illustrated through the uncle's narration of the burning death and rebirth of his forest during World War II. Estes includes her own rendition of the Christmas tree story: the tree in the forest cut down, adorned at the house, then burned as firewood in the end. She relates the story of her own urban forest started in her back yard, inspired by her uncle's thoughts on nature. Estes's style is charming, spellbinding, and lyrical.

0-8032-8953-7,Hotel Splendid (European Women Writers),"Redonnet, Marie",Bison Books,117,9/1/1994,,Paperback,"<p>These three short novels are the first works to appear in English by a remarkable contemporary French author, Marie Redonnet. Born in Paris in 1947, Redonnet taught for a number of years in a suburban lyc&eacute;e before deciding to pursue a writing career full time. Since her volume of poetry Le Mort & Cie appeared in 1985, she has published four novels, a novella, numerous short stories, and three dramatic works. <p>In translator Jordan Stump's words, these three novels, ""unmistakably fit together, although they have neither characters nor setting in common. Redonnet sees the three novels as a triptych&#58; each panel stands alone, and yet all coalesce to form a whole."" Each is narrated by a different woman. H&ocirc;tel Splendid recounts the daily life of three sisters who live in a decrepit hotel on the edge of a swamp; Forever Valley is about a sixteen-year-old girl who works in a dance-hall and looks for the dead; Rose Mellie Rose is the story of another adolescent girl who assembles a photographic and written record of her life in the dying town of &Ocirc;at.<p>Redonnet's novels have been compared to those of Annie Ernaux, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Samuel Beckett. She has since acknowledged the crucial influence which Beckett's work has had upon her literary work. And yet she is also notably different from the great master of modern literature. ""Where Beckett's characters slide almost inevitably toward extinction, resignation, and silence,"" Stump points out, ""Redonnet's display a force for life and creation that borders on the triumphant. . . . [They] retain even in the darkest situations a remarkable persistence, openness, and above all hope, a hope that may well be, however unspectacularly, repaid in the end.""<p>Jordan Stump is an assistant professor of French at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Built at the edge of a swamp and over an underground lake, the Htel Splendid had given its owner, the book's narrator, ``nothing but satisfaction'' since she inherited it from her grandmother. Until, that is, she was visited by the plagues that drive this spare and darkly comic novel. The first plague comes in the form of the narrator's two sisters, who had left their grandmother's hotel to wander through Europe in search of sanitoria for the sickly Ada and a stage for the would-be actress, Adel. Spoiled and petulant, Ada and Adel offer their sister little help as she tries to cope with pests (flies, mosquitoes, rats, bedbugs, spiders, termites); workmen (carpenter, cabinetmaker, roofer, plumber) and their bills; and guests (prospectors, geologists, team foremen, engineers) associated with an ill-fated trans-swamp railroad line. The Splendid is the only home the narrator has ever known and she remembers its early history as a incongruously swank hotel (the grandmother had each room built with a toilet, the bane of her granddaughter's days) shimmering at the edge of nature's mucky, encroaching chaos. It's a great image and Redonnet makes skillful use of the broadly metaphoric possibilities. It is the kind of novel Edward Gorey could love and, sometimes, reading Redonnet's telegraphic prose, one it seems he might even have written. (``Adel had a fit of hysterics. She wears a corset to make her stand up straighter. It squeezes her too much, it constricts her heart and she has spells. Sometimes she faints in front of the guests.'')

This new collection of documents - letters, diary extracts, poems, public speeches - charts the visions that inspired women and the obstacles that confronted them. Dealing with the period from colonisation to Federation in 1901, Freedom Bound I shows how intertwined were women's public and personal lives, and how bound by custom, ties, affections and duties. The different meanings of freedom have been shaped by the nature of women's oppression, their quests given focus by their different points of departure. Convict women protested - often violently - at the indignities they endured; Aboriginal women protested at the cruelty of the frontier and the paternalism of the mission; and white middle-class women demanded the freedom to participate in the public world. Together with its companion volume, Freedom Bound II, which deals with the twentieth century, this volume documents the dreams that inspired women, the pleasures and pain that informed their politics and the desires that enthralled them, even as they bade them to be free. It is an essential resource for students and teachers of Australian women's history.",en,1,"Height: 8.49 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 0.8487797087 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/57/9781863737357.jpg,Success,82,18.5

Refusing to be regimented into the quiet habits of a nun's life, she escaped from a Basque convent at age fourteen dressed as a man, and continuing her deception, ventured to Peru and Chile as a soldier in the Spanish army. After mistakenly killing her own brother in a duel, she roamed the Andean highlands, becoming a gambler and a killer, and always just evading the grasp of the law. Distinguished for her fighting skills and cursed with a quick temper, Catalina de Erauso spent much of her life balancing precariously between valor and villainy. One of the earliest known autobiographies by a woman, Lieutenant Nun offers a portrait of a bold young girl who defied her society's gender roles, yet remained committed to its service as a participant in the conquest of the Americas. She is an adored folkloric hero of the Spanish-speaking world, and this delightful translation introduces a new audience to the audacious escapades of Catalina de Erauso, the Lieutenant Nun.

                        <p>""English version of Historia de la monja alfâerez (1988), the 'autobiographical' account of a Basque woman who fled convent life in Spain; made her way to the Indies disguised as a page boy; and spent 22 years as a soldier in the colonies, mostly in Chile and the Perus, in early 17th century. Traditionally rejected as a work of fiction, Catalina de Erauso's story has been verified - to the extent that verification is possible - as well as authenticated by recent scholarship.
