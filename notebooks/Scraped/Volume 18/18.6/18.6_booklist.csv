Weaving the stories of individual women together with systematic analysis of gendered litigation patterns, Cornelia Dayton argues that women's relation to the courtroom scene in early New England shifted from one of integration in the mid-seventeenth century to one of marginality by the eve of the Revolution.</p>
<p>Using the court records of New Haven, which originally had the most Puritan-dominated legal regime of all the colonies, Dayton argues that Puritanism's insistence on godly behavior and communal modes of disputing initially created unusual opportunities for women's voices to be heard within the legal system. But women's presence in the courts declined significantly over time as Puritan beliefs lost their status as the organizing principles of society, as legal practice began to adhere more closely to English patriarchal models, as the economy became commercialized, and as middle-class families developed an ethic of privacy. By demonstrating that the early eighteenth century was a crucial locus of change in law, economy, and gender ideology, Dayton's findings argue for a reconceptualization of women's status in colonial New England and for a new periodization of women's history.</p>",en,3rd ed.,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 inches, Weight: 1.30954583628 pounds, Width: 0.89 inches",21.44,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/15/9780807845615.jpg,Success,116,18.6

0-8165-1630-8,Earthquake Weather: Poems (Volume 33) (Sun Tracks),"Gould, Janice",University of Arizona Press,87,4/1/1996,,Paperback,"<p>It’s unmistakable, that strangely calm air and sky that signals big change ahead: earthquake weather. These are familiar signs to Janice Gould, a poet, a lesbian, and a mixed-blood California Indian of Koyangk’auwi Maidu descent. Her sense of isolation is intense, her search for identity is relentless, and her words can take one’s breath away. Sometimes accepting, sometimes full of anger, Gould’s work is rare, filtered through the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of a lesbian of Indian heritage. Over and over again, she speaks as an outsider looking in at the lives of others--through a doorway, out of a car window, or from the shambles of a broken relationship. Showing a steady courage in the midst of this alienation, her words are also stark testimony to the struggle of an individual caught in social and emotional contexts defined by others. In <i>Earthquake Weather,</i> as in an evolving friendship, Gould opens herself to the reader in stages. ""I did not know how lonely I was / till we began to talk,"" she writes in an opening section, setting the introspective tone of what’s to come. She begins with a focus on those universal truths that both bind us and isolate us from each other: the pain of loss, the finality of death, our longing to see beneath the surface of things. Next, the poet turns to her growing-up years during the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. She describes a family in turmoil and an Indian heritage that, oddly, was one of the factors that made her feel most disconnected from other people. And she writes poignantly about her increasing alienation from prescribed sexual roles. ""What’s wrong with me? / Where do I belong? Why / am I here? Why can’t I / hold on?"" Finally, as in a trusting friendship, Gould offers the reader vivid word portraits of relationships in her life--women she has loved and who have loved her. Erotic and deeply personal, these poems serve as both a reconciliation and affirmation of her individuality. ""Yet would you deny / that between women desire exists / that in our friendship a delicate / and erotic strand of fire unites us?"" The poems in this book, says critic Toby Langen, are most powerful for their ""courageous drawing on experience and feelings."" They will speak to many general readers as well as anyone interested in questions of gender and identity, including students of literature, lesbian/women’s studies, social/cultural studies, or American Indian studies.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.31526103466 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/08/9780816516308.jpg,Success,113,18.6

The issues addressed by the book were examined during three major conferences in 1994&#58; the annual conference of the British Sociological Association, the 2nd International Conference on the BioPsychoSocial Aspects of AIDS and the Xth International Conference on AIDS.

William Armstrong Percy III maintains that Cretan sages established a system under which a young warrior in his early twenties took a teenager of his own aristocratic background as a beloved until the age of thirty, when service to the state required the older partner to marry. The practice spread with significant variants to other Greek-speaking areas. In some places it emphasized development of the athletic, warrior individual, while in others both intellectual and civic achievement were its goals. In Athens it became a vehicle of cultural transmission, so that the best of each older cohort selected, loved, and trained the best of the younger. Pederasty was from the beginning both physical and emotional, the highest and most intense type of male bonding. These pederastic bonds, Percy believes, were responsible for the rise of Hellas and the ""Greek miracle"": in two centuries the population of Attica, a mere 45,000 adult males in six generations, produced an astounding number of great men who laid the enduring foundations of Western thought and civilization.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.3448197982 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",34.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/98/9780252022098.jpg,Success,75,18.6

Murray examines the emergence of gay and lesbian social life, the creation of lesbigay communities, and the forces of resistance that have mobilized and fostered a group identity. Murray also considers the extent to which there is a single ""modern"" homosexuality and the enormous range of homosexual behaviors, typifications, self-identifications, and meanings. Challenging prevailing assumptions about gay history and society, Murray questions conventional wisdom about the importance of World War II and the Stonewall riots for conceiving and challenging the notion of a shared oppression. He reviews gay complicity in the repathologizing of homosexuality during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. Discussing recent demands for inclusion in the ""straight"" institutions of marriage and the U.S. military, he concludes that these are new forms of resistance, not attempts to assimilate. Finally, Murray examines racial and ethnic differences in self-representation and identification. Drawing on two decades of studying gay life in North America, this tour de force of empirical documentation and social theory critically reviews what is known about the emergence, growth, and internal diversity of communities of openly gay men and lesbians. American Gay deepens our understanding of the ways individuals construct sexualities through working and living together.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1243575362 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",4.32,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/37/9780226551937.jpg,Success,72,18.6

And they still get ahead! Why? As psychologist Adrienne Mendell learned when she interviewed one-hundred male executives, the traits that women spend their entire lives erasing from their personalities are actually the qualities that men value in the world of work. And since men are still in the power positions, if you don't play it their way, you don't play at all.<br>Based on Mendell's interviews and her experience of counseling hundreds of frustrated career women, How Men Think identifies the seven rules that men learned by playing sports as children&#151;games that excluded girls. These rules may seem simple on the surface, but understanding them as men do is anything but easy. You may have fallen into many of these traps yourself&#58;<br>* You're mad because you want your male boss to let you control your projects. But you've got to take control&#151;that's the only way you'll get it.<br>* You're steamed because a male colleague consistently takes credit for your work. Do you make a point of touting your accomplishments?<br>* When you make a mistake you apologize. But the man you apologize to doesn't think you're polite&#151;he thinks you're admitting incompetence.<br>* A fight with a male colleague leaves you shaken. But the men in your office shout at each other for an hour and then go out for a beer.<br>These are the times that try women's souls! The strategies, insights, and eye-opening advice in How Men Think will help you get along better with the boys and propel you to the top where you belong.<br>&quot;The more women have opportunities to play sports the more proficient they will become in competing in this men's world of 'unwritten rules.' To bridge the gap, Mendell's book, How Men Think, is a necessary guide for women working with men.&quot;<br>&#151;Diane Everett, Ph.D.<br> Executive Director National Association for Girls and Women in Sport</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Psychologist Mendell offers guidance to female professionals seeking to understand the behavior patterns of men in the workplace.

0-385-47500-4,Joining the Tribe: Growing Up Gay and Lesbian in the '90s,"Due, Linnea",Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group,320,8/1/1995,,Paperback,"<p><P>As our country struggles to accept its gay and lesbian citizens, the debate for gay civil rights often focuses on the issue of choice, with the majority of Americans believing that to be gay is a choice, one that's embraced for its lifestyle. This belief ignores the presence and experience of one segment of the gay and lesbian population&#58; its youth. In <i>Joining The Tribe</i>, journalist Linnea Due travels America to create a portrait of gay and lesbian teenagers as an endangered and vulnerable community whose diversity, courage, and resiliency will inspire gay and straight readers alike. By vividly documenting the lives of gay and lesbian teenagers, Due shows that homosexuality is not about choice. It's about fights in the schoolyard, whispers in the locker room, cruel classmates, and oblivious or abusive parents. Most gay and lesbian youth endure severe humiliation and isolation for being gay, resulting in depression and low self-esteem for most, and suicide for some. Combining in-depth interviews with social analysis, Due reveals the realities gay and lesbian teenagers face, often without the support of family, peer groups, or adult gay and lesbian networks. With stories from across America, Due meets kids from a range of backgrounds and families, with some in the closet, some out, most somewhere-in-between, all struggling to grow into adulthood. By turns heartbreaking and infuriating, <i>Joining The Tribe</i> shows how against overwhelming odds, gay and lesbian teenagers continue to survive and bounce back, ready to join their brothers and sisters in gay America's fight for freedom and respect.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>If Due's (High and Outside) collection of poignant interviews with gay and lesbian youth reminds us of one thing, it is that greater visibility does not mean greater safety. Due (whose feature on gay and lesbian teenagers was declared one of the top six underreported stories of 1992 by Media Alliance/Project Censored) talked with lesbian, gay and bisexual adolescents of different ethnicities, classes and backgrounds across the U.S. They vividly recount the assaults they suffer in their families and schools and in the broader society, assaults including name-calling, beatings and death threats. Many testify eloquently to the fear, pain and shame that come not because of their sexual orientation per se, but because of the devastating results its disclosure had on many of their social relationships. At the same time, some speak touchingly of first love, of support from family and friends and of the efforts by some communities to provide services to gay and lesbian youth. Unlike many of the professional resources available for counselors, teachers and others concerned about these teens, Due lets her interviewees speak for themselves, while her sensitive editing provides background, commentary and balance between individual and collective experience. The result is a moving, vital pastiche. (Sept.)</p>",en,1st Anchor Bks Ed.

0-8071-2070-7,"Nella Larsen, Novelist of the Harlem Renaissance: A Woman's Life Unveiled","Davis, Thadious M.",LSU Press,496,5/1/1996,,Paperback,"<p>Nella Larsen (1891-1964) is recognized as one of the most influential, and certainly one of the most enigmatic, writers of the Harlem Renaissance. With the instant success of her two novels, Quicksand (1928) and Passing (1929), she became a bright light in New York's literary firmament. But her meteoric rise was followed by an equally sudden fall: In 1930 she was accused of plagiarizing a short story, and soon thereafter she disappeared from both the literary and African-American worlds of New York. She lived the rest of her life - more than three decades - out of the public eye, working primarily as a nurse. In a remarkable achievement, Thadious Davis has penetrated the fog of mystery that has surrounded Larsen to present a detailed and fascinating account of the life and work of this gifted, determined, yet vulnerable artist. The exact circumstances of Larsen's birth, especially the racial identities of her parents, probably cannot be definitively sorted out; but what is certain and most significant is that Larsen was a child of mixed race who was raised for a few years in Chicago as if she were white but then, while an adolescent, sent off to the Fisk University Normal High School with the understanding that she would prepare to assume a position among the black middle class. Throughout her life Larsen appears to have cultivated a sense of mystery about herself. She was born Nellie Walker but from childhood on changed her name several times to reflect different self-conceptions, and when she did offer information about herself, she gave differing versions of the basic facts. At first glance Larsen seems to have been a strange amalgam of arrogance and insecurity. But Davis' analysis of Larsen's personality and her position as a woman of mixed race in the America of her time - a person whom society defined as marginal in several ways - shows that such contradictions were only to be expected. In addition to unraveling the details of Larsen's personal life, Davi</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Davis, a professor of English at Brown University ( Faulkner's ``Negro'' Art ), rescues an African American writer from neglect in an oustanding, masterfully researched study that also provides a vivid picture of life in Harlem during the 1920s. Larsen (1891-1964), the daughter of a white mother and a black father, was initially raised as white by her mother and stepfather, then was sent to live and study at black schools. She married Elmer Imes, an African American physicist, and the two socialized with the Harlem Renaissance authors who were to inspire Larsen to write. Acclaimed for her novels, Quicksand and Passing , which dealt with women from racially mixed backgrounds, Larsen was later accused of plagiarizing a short story. After her marriage ended in divorce, she stopped writing and spent the rest of her life in obscurity, working as a nurse. Davis theorizes that Larsen's painful childhood caused her to continually reinvent herself and shroud herself in mystery. Illustrations not seen by PW.

When adolescent girls&#151;once assured and resilient&#151;silence or censor themselves to maintain relationships, they often become depressed, and develop eating disorders or other psychological problems. But when adolescent girls remain outspoken it is often difficult for others to stay in relationship with them, leading girls to be excluded or labeled as troublemakers. If this is true in an affluent suburban setting, where much of the groundbreaking research took place, what of girls from poor and working-class families, what of fading womanhood amid issues of class and race? And how might these issues affect the researchers themselves? In <i>Between Voice and Silence</i> Taylor, Gilligan, and Sullivan grapple with these questions. The result is a deeper and richer appreciation of girls' development and women's psychological health.<P>In an urban public school, among girls from diverse cultural backgrounds&#151;African American, Hispanic, Portuguese, and white&#151;and poor and working-class families, the authors sought a key to the relationship between risk, resistance, and girls' psychological development and health. Specifically, they found cultural differences that affect girls' coming of age in this country. In <i>Between Voice and Silence</i>, the story of the study parallels another, that of African American, Hispanic, and white women who gathered to examine their own differences and to learn how to avoid perpetuating past divisions among women. Together, these two stories reveal an intergenerational struggle to develop relationships between and among women and to hold and respect difference.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Public school girls ``at risk''-for early motherhood, dropping out of school, abusive relationships-are the subject of this collaborative study by three Boston-based psychologists. Earlier ``voice-centered'' (listening to) research on girls in a single-sex private school produced solid evidence for believing that at adolescence, girls lose a sense of self and undergo a developmental crisis that inhibits their expressive faculties. This report focuses on 26 girls in grades eight and nine who are culturally and racially different from one another, from poor and working-class urban backgrounds, who reveal their strategies for navigating the psychological distance between home and school. The researchers speak of their own learning to listen to girls who, at the start of high school, were beginning to silence themselves as the result of personal losses, betrayals and isolation. As with the earlier, landmark study, this important, accessible research establishes the need for bringing women and girls together. Taylor teaches at Simmons College; Gilligan is a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, where Sullivan is a doctoral candidate.

Everyone said she would never walk again. But Wilma refused to believe it. Not only would she walk again, she vowed, she'd run. And she did run&#151;all the way to the Olympics, where she became the first American woman to earn three gold medals in a single olympiad.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>""No one expected such a tiny girl to have a first birthday,"" begins this inspiring biographical sketch of a legendary track stars. Born in 1940 in Tennessee, the chronically sickly though ""lively"" Rudolph contracted polio just before her fifth birthday. Though not expected to walk again, the fiercely determined girl persevered with her leg exercises; by the time she was 12, she no longer needed her steel brace. Eight years later, Rudolph represented the U.S. in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, where, despite a twisted ankle, she became the first American woman to win three gold medals during a single Olympic competition. Krull's (Lives of the Musicians) characteristic, conversational style serves her especially well here. Through her words the nearly superhuman Rudolph seems both personable and recognizable. Rendered in acrylic, watercolor and gouache, Caldecott Medalist Diaz's (Smoky Night) imposing, richly hued illustrations have a distinctive, cubist feel. The artist's bold design superimposes this art against sepia-toned photographs of relevant background images: playground sand, wooden fence slats, the gravel of a running track. This juxtaposition yields busy, effectively textured pages, flawed only by the text's curiously embellished font-the letters look as though they have been speckled with either ink blots or dust.

<p>At different times in her life, Modotti was a silent screen actress, a model for Diego Rivera's murals, and a lover of photographer Edward Weston. She was also a champion for the Mexican people who lovingly referred to her as Tinisima.</p>
<p>In 1929, Modotti was accused of the murder of Julio Antonio Mella, her Cuban lover.

0-252-06528-X,"Good-bye, Piccadilly: BRITISH WAR BRIDES IN AMERICA (Statue of Liberty Ellis Island)","Virden, Jenel",University of Illinois Press,192,2/1/1996,"Social Sciences, Emigration & Immigration",Paperback,"<p>As much of the world tried to return to normal living and working patterns after World War II, some 70,000 British women chose to be uprooted from the homeland they knew and loved. These were British war brides, a uniformly young group who by marrying American servicemen became part of the largest single group of female immigrants to the United States. Though the women came to the U.S. from all parts of the British Isles, they were an unusually homogeneous group, averaging 23 years of age, from working- or lower-middle-class families and having completed mandatory schooling to the age of fourteen. For the most part they emigrated alone and didn't move into an existing immigrant population. Jenel Virden draws on records in the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the Public Record Office in London, as well as questionnaires and personal interviews, in relating the women's story. Virden finds that the marriages actually took place in spite of, rather than because of, the war. And, while the women benefited from special nonrestrictive immigration legislation - and found public welcomes and a good deal of favorable publicity when they arrived - they also had much in common with other immigrant groups, including a strong sense of ethnic identity.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>The daughter of a World War II British war bride, Virden has penned a work about the experiences of this overlooked category of immigrants to the United States. Instead of a personal narrative, she has chosen to write a dispassionate analysis of the phenomenon based upon her study of archival material, statistics, questionnaires, and selective interviews. The result is informative but not very involving. That the war brides made huge sacrifices in leaving their homeland to begin new lives with men they hardly knew, that they overcame a mountain of red tape, culture shock, and a degree of anti-British prejudice, and that they felt lost between two worlds are predictable conclusions that need little quantitative substantiation. In-depth case studies or lengthy interviews, rather than the occasional anecdote, could have brought these generalized findings to life. While valuable for sociologists and other academics, this work will have little appeal in public libraries.Rose M.

0-8014-8174-0,The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment,"Goodman, Dena",Cornell University Press,336,1/10/1996,,Paperback,"<p>In the first major reinterpretation of the French Enlightenment in twenty years, Dena Goodman moves beyond the traditional approach to the Enlightenment as a chapter in Western intellectual history and examines its deeper significance as cultural history. She finds the very epicenter of the Enlightenment in a community of discourse known as the Republic of Letters, where salons governed by women advanced the Enlightenment project ""to change the common way of thinking."" Goodman details the history of the Republic of Letters in the Parisian salons, where men and women, philosophes and salonnieres, together not only introduced reciprocity into intellectual life through the practices of letter writing and polite conversation but also developed a republican model of government that was to challenge the monarchy. Providing a new understanding of women's importance in the Enlightenment, Goodman demonstrates that in the Republic of Letters men and women played complementary - and unequal - roles. Salonnieres governed the Republic of Letters by enforcing rules of polite conversation that made possible a discourse characterized by liberty and civility. Goodman chronicles the story of the Republic of Letters from its earliest formation through major periods of change: the production of the Encyclopedia, the proliferation of a print culture that widened circles of readership beyond the control of salon governance, and the early years of the French Revolution. Although the legacy of the Republic of Letters remained a force in French cultural and political life, in the 1780s men formed new intellectual institutions that asserted their ability to govern themselves and that marginalized women. The Republic of Letters introduces provocative explanations both for the failure of the Enlightenment and for the role of the Enlightenment in the French Revolution.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Goodman (history, Louisiana State Univ.) aims to re-create the social and cultural context in which the ideas of the Enlightenment were created and spread. Drawing from the work of Jrgen Habermas (The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, MIT Pr., 1989), she traces the creation of a public intellectual community in France from the 17th century and explains its development through the French Revolution. Challenging traditional Enlightenment historiography, Goodman describes the Enlightenment as a set of social practices in which both men and women participated. She argues that historians have not taken a positive or serious view of the role of the salonnires. The 1780s, however, saw the emergence of new intellectual institutions in which women were not as central, and an age of ""masculine self governance"" was born.

Constantine Stassos, a Greek immigrant, marries Mary Cuccio, an Italian-American girl, and they have three children, each fated to a complex life. Susan is oppressed by her beauty and her father's affections; Billy is brilliant, and gay; Zoe is a wild, heedless visionary. As the years pass, their lives unfold in ways that compel them--and their parents--to meet ever greater challenges.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The cheers that greeted his literary debut, A Home at the End of the World, will resound again for Cunningham's second novel. Here his prose is again rich, graceful and luminous, and he exhibits a remarkable maturity of vision and understanding of the human condition. The marriage of Greek immigrant Constantine to Mary, the offspring of an Italian clan, is a mismatch of incompatible personalities, a union that is later maintained in a delicate balance between incomprehension and rage. The birth of their three children exacerbates the tension and leaves its indelible mark unto the third generation. When he becomes a partner in a shoddy construction company, Con lifts the Stassos family from near-poverty in Elizabeth, N.J., to a nouveau-riche enclave on Long Island, but his lifelong concern with money, and with exhibiting ``manliness,'' erupts into violent behavior that alienates his only son, Billy, even before the boy realizes that he is a homosexual. Con damages the other children, too; Susan escapes his sexual overtures through an early marriage, and wild, feral Zoe joins the drug culture in New York. Yet Cunningham condemns no one; he understands that Con ``exists in a chaos of yearning . . . [of] love and... hunger and... bottomless grief,'' and he portrays the other characters with equal sympathy. In delineating the story of this disconnected family, each member floating in his or her own sphere of bewilderment, anger, mistrust and fear but inextricably bound to others by flesh and blood, Cunningham illuminates the chasm between parents and children in contemporary America, beginning in the 1970s, when drug use and sexual freedom broke traditional constraints. Both fate and accident determine all of the characters' lives. Con betrays beautiful, distant Mary with his partner's fat, plain secretary-and ends up married to her. Mary becomes friends with Cassandra, a drag queen who is the godmother of Zoe's illegitimate half-black son. Billy renames himself Will, and finally finds a loving companion. All the characters are fallible and come late to self-knowledge. Cunningham's portraits are so honest and sensitive that we can see into their souls. His prose is both restrained and mesmerizing: individual scenes-such as one of teenagers in a car wreck-become incandescent images. In the end, what remains of Con and Mary's failed dreams of their lives and those of their children and grandchildren becomes a transcendent testament to the power of human endurance. 75,000 first printing; movie rights optioned by Tony Ganz/Wolf Productions; author tour.

0-88920-245-1,Breaking Anonymity: The Chilly Climate for Women Faculty,,Wilfrid Laurier University Press,400,5/30/1995,,Paperback,"<p>Across North America a growing body of ""chilly climate"" research documents the role played by environmental factors in reproducing gender inequality: practices that stereotype, exclude and devalue women are persistently powerful forces in creating ""glass ceilings"" and maintaining ""pink ghettos."" Women academics in North American universities and colleges offer an especially striking case for such research. Precisely because of their elite status, the accounts now emerging of the ""chilly climate"" faced by academic women throw into sharp relief the mechanisms that foster gender inequity throughout North American society.</p>
<p>Collected in this volume are a number of reports and commentaries on ""climate issues"" as they affect women faculty in Canadian universities. They include Sheila McIntyre's <i>Memo</i>, an account of gender harassment in the context of a law school that was first circulated in 1986; two reports by and about women faculty at the University of Western Ontario that were inspired by McIntyre's <i>Memo</i>; accounts of the reactions of male colleagues, the administration and the media to ""climate"" studies; and several chapters that critically reframe the discussion of chilly climate practices in terms of questions of race and sexual identity.</p>
<p>Taken together, these reports and discussions demonstrate the importance of addressing the environmental roots of women's continuing inequity both within and outside contemporary academia. They communicate specific experiences which testify to the existence of a chilly climate in our universities, and call into question any supposition that women and men have achieved equity to the degree that they could be said to work in ""the same"" environment in these institutions.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.16183612074 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",32.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/50/9780889202450.jpg,Success,61,18.6

Yet relatively few prevention efforts have been targeted at such men and the diverse communities from which they come. Bisexualities and AIDS reviews, from a global perspective, what has been learned about the relationship between male bisexuality and AIDS. It examines the forms and contexts in which bisexuality exists, and the difference between bisexual behaviour and bisexual identity. The implications of diverse forms of bisexuality for HIV prevention are discussed in subsequent chapters. Prevention efforts in a range of contexts and countries are examined including: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, France, India, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Dominican Republic, The Philippines, UK and USA.

0-19-510124-3,Gender and Discourse,"Tannen, Deborah",Oxford University Press,240,1/4/1996,,Paperback,"<br>
Deborah Tannen's <em>You Just Don't Understand</em> has been on the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list for more than three years (in cloth and paper) and has sold over a million and a half copies. Clearly, Tannen's insights into how and why women and men so often misunderstand each other when they talk has touched a nerve. For years an internationally known and highly respected scholar in the field of linguistics, she has now become widely known for her work on how language both reflects and perpetuates the relationships between men and women. Her life work has demonstrated how close and intelligent analysis of conversation can reveal the extraordinary complexities of social relationships--including relationships between men and women. <br>
 Now, in <em>Gender and Discourse</em>, Tannen has gathered together five of her scholarly essays--which provide a theoretical backdrop to her bestselling books--and an informative introduction which discusses her field of linguistics, describes the research methods she typically uses, and addresses the controversies surrounding her field as well as some misunderstandings of her work. (She argues, for instance, that her cultural approach to gender differences does not deny that men dominate women in society, nor does it ascribe gender differences to women's ""essential nature."") The essays themselves cover a wide range of topics. In one, she analyzes a number of conversational strategies--such as interruption, topic raising, indirection, and silence--and shows that, contrary to much work on language and gender, no strategy leads inflexibly to dominance or submissiveness in conversation--interruption (or overlap) can be supportive, silence and indirection can be used to control. It is the interactional context, the participants' individual styles, and the interaction of their styles, Tannen shows, that result in the balance of power. She also provides a fascinating analysis of four groups of males and females (second-, sixth-, and tenth-grade students, and 25 year olds) conversing with their best friends, and she includes an early article co-authored with Robin Lakoff that presents a theory of conversational strategy, illustrated by analysis of dialogue in Ingmar Bergman's <em>Scenes From a Marriage</em>. <br>
 Readers interested in the theoretical framework behind Tannen's work will find this volume fascinating. It will be sure to interest anyone curious about the crucial yet often unnoticed role that language and gender play in our daily lives.

                        <p>Clearly, the author of the bestselling You Just Don't Understand posseses wonderful insights into how and why women and men so often misunderstand each other. For this new work, Tannen has gathered together five of her scholarly essays--which provide a theoretical backdrop to her bestselling books--that address the controversies surrounding her field.

A guide for the coming-out journey, <i>Outing Yourself</i> will convince all who read it that, in the words of the author, ""The stress of coming out will never be as hard on you as the stress of staying in was.""</p>


                        <p>From the author of Queer in America comes a complete, step-by-step guide to coming out of the closet--the first coming-out guide to the '90s. Signorile's pull-no-punches style gives this book a Susan Powter-ish Stop the Insanity! approach to a difficult and often mishandled experience.

--Reverend Sharon Vandegrift United Methodist Chaplain Drexel University Childhood religious images of judgment, punishment, unworthiness, and shame, of male saviors, messiahs, and Higher Powers, pursue all women into adulthood. Many women realize they must leave behind these traditional concepts and images for a more authentic spirituality. Yet they find, to their dismay, that the male symbols of God are deeply rooted in their psyches and difficult to transform.<br>
In this book, the poignant personal memories of women of all ages and lifestyles are interwoven with the collective story of women buried in the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Bible. Together, these women explore the lost glory of Eve, Lilith, and Mary. They teach us to plumb the depths of our relationships with our mothers, our bodies, and ourselves; our sexuality and vulnerability; and our journey into old age. Each chapter offers a rich tapestry of poetry, ritual, story, and meditation, a splendid invitation to join a circle of women in search of woman-affirming spirituality.<br>

Fearlessly confronting the horrors experiences by surviving gay men without giving way to hopelessness, denial, or blame, Reviving the Tribe offers an inspiring blueprint for the gay community which faces a continuing spiral of disaster.
<p>In Reviving the Tribe, Author Eric Rofes argues that a return to the interrupted agenda of gay liberation may provide long-term motivation to keep gay men alive and spur rejuvenation of new generations of gay culture. By interweaving social history, psychology, anthropology, epidemiology, sociology, feminist theory, and sexology with his own journey through the epidemic, Rofes provides a moving and compelling argument for stepping out of the “state of emergency” and embracing a life beyond disease. He boldly offers a plan for community regeneration focused on restoring mental health, reclaiming sexuality, and mending the social fabric of communal gay life.</p>
<p>Rofes asks unspoken questions lurking in gay men’s minds and suggests answers to these questions, hitting such controversial topics as:</p>
<ul>
<li>gay men’s sex cultures of the 1970s</li>
<li>why “educated” gay men continue to become HIV-infected</li>
<li>changing forms of gay masculinity</li>
<li>the opening of new sex clubs and bathhouses</li>
<li>leaving “rage activism” behind</li>
<li>links between the Holocaust and AIDS</li>
<li>unacknowledged roots in the feminist movement of gay men’s AIDS response</li>
<li>mass denial of chronic trauma among gay men
<p>The refusal to confront the ever-intensifying manifestations of AIDS has seriously endangered the foundation of contemporary gay communities. Rofes argues that many gay men suffer from the ”disaster syndrome,” a psychologically determined response that defends individuals against being overwhelmed by traumatic experience. In Reviving the Tribe, he provides a radical critique of contemporary gay political culture and suggests alternatives which offer the opportunity to face history, grapple with decimation, and regenerate communal life.</p>
<p>Cautioning that an honest analysis of recent gay history and urban cultures promises neither to stop gay men’s suffering nor to end continuing HIV infections, Reviving the Tribe provides gay men with a clear lens through which they might scrutinize their lives, come to a new understanding of the epidemic’s impact on their generation, and redirect activism. This courageous and inspiring work brings Rofes’commanding intellect and twenty years of grassroots gay activism to bear on the challenging task of reconstructing gay life in the new mellennium.</p>
<p>Reviving the Tribe is filled with insight of special interest to gay men, lesbians involved in the mixed lesbian/gay movement, sociologists, public health workers, psychologists, counselors, sex educators, religious leaders, and AIDS prevention policymakers searching for fresh vision.</p>

Cuentos, recuerdos, stories, memories&#151;all are stirred into a simmering caldo by a writer whose love for her heritage shines through every page. Reminiscent of Like Water for Chocolate, the book is a rich mix of the simplest ingredients--food, family, tradition. We see Silviana striding to her chicken coop, triggering the feathered pandemonium of chickens who smell death in the air. We meet Elena, standing before the mirror in her wedding dress, and Teodoro SÃ¡nchez, who sleeps under the sky and smells of chaparral and mesquite pollen and the stream bottom and the bone dust of generations. There s the monsignor sitting on the edge of a sofa, sipping NescafÃ© from a china cup, and here is Sister Francisca with her warm, minty breath warning us away from impure thoughts. Be on your best behavior, too, in TÃ­a Petra s Edwardian parlor--la DoÃ±a Petrita, descended from conquistadores, might just deliver a tap on your head with her silver-handled walking stick. Then, with Mamacita, spend a summer afternoon bent over your embroidery with trembling hand and sweaty upper lip, and all the while wondering what in the world it feels like to be kissed. Intermingled with the author s stories are collective memories of the barrio, tales halfway between heaven and earth that seem to connect barrio residents to each other and to their past. These cuentos are mystical and dreamy, peopled with ghosts and miracles and Aztec princesses dressed in feathers and gold. Come, sit down and have some salsa and atortilla--fresh and homemade, it goes without saying; people who buy tortillas at the market might as well move to Los Angeles, for they have already lost their souls. Then open the pages of this book. Help yourself to another feast of food and flowers, music and dancing, sunshine and moonlight&#151;everything glorious and mundane, serious and humorous, earthly and spiritual, poignant and joyful, in la vida mexicoamericana.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Here, Arizona writer Martin (Songs My Mother Sang to Me: An Oral History of Mexican American Women) presents personal and collective memories in plainspoken yet lyrical stories of her mexicana life experiences in the Los Angeles barrio. The painfully real and the irreal mix: in the fantastical tale Plumas, a shy cafeteria employee is always late because she oversleeps while dreaming that she is Xochitl, a priestess of the Aztec creator goddess Tonantz'in; in El Creciente, third- and fourth-generation city slickers go to a family reunion and get caught in a flood that carries past them a phantom flotilla of the town's dead. In the more strictly realistic Dichos, a girl drags her butt and feels like a martyr when she goes to visit her great-grandmother, but once there is engulfed by the smells of cooking and the rhythm of the old woman's proverbial sayings. Though Martin overdoes the proverbs and cultural edification in some other stories, overall her blend of Spanish words, details and metaphors offers an affectionate depiction of life in a changing neighborhood.

Dr. Richard Jolly, Acting Executive Director UNICEF</p>
<p>Breastfeeding is a beautiful process. It involves the participation of both mother and child and cannot be duplicated by a glass bottle and rubber nipple. So why does the United States have the lowest breastfeeding rate in the industrialized world? In Milk, Money and Madness, Baumslag and Michels examine the issue of breastfeeding, clearly drawing a line between fact and fiction. Among the main points addressed are: o How U.S. taxpayers unwittingly support and encourage bottle-feeding by spending over $500 million each year to provide 37% of the infants in the U.S. with free formula. o How a product created to help sick children and foundlings was transformed into a powerful international industry with revenues of $22 million a day. o How an intimate and self-affirming life experience that is responsible for the survival of our species has been reduced to just one feeding option. Milk, Money, and Madness provides parents and health professionals with the information they need to fully appreciate and advise about this critical life choice. By reviewing the history, culture, biology, and politics of breastfeeding, Milk, Money, and Madness gives the reader a more complete understanding of the uniqueness of breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The crucial decision between breastfeeding and formula feeding is increasingly complicated by misinformation and unfounded theories which cloud the actual facts. By all accounts, breastmilk is the most amazing life-sustaining fluid known to humanity. Many women who breastfeed characterize it as perhaps the most fulfilling life experience they will ever know. Scientific research supports the fact that breastfed babies are healthier, have lower infant mortality rates and fewer chronic illnesses throughout their lives than formula-fed babies. Similarly, women who breastfeed are significantly less likely to contract serious illnesses such as breast cancer. Alarmingly few people are aware of the unique benefits of breastfeeding and do not understand the dangers and risks of feeding an infant formula. In fact, the United States has the lowest breastfeeding rate in the industrialized world. Why has our society defied common sense and scientific data when breastfeeding has so many biological, emotional, environmental, and even financial advantages over laboratory blends?</p>
<p><i>Milk, Money, and Madness</i> is a thought-provoking book that offers honest answers and straight facts about breastfeeding. This book is designed to provide women, men, health workers, doctors, nurses, and midwives with the knowledge they need to advise or decide about the most suitable means of nourishment for infants. Baumslag and Michels consider the effects of 50 years of clever marketing and advertising which have transformed this society into one where bottle feeding is the norm and infant formula is considered to be essential to women's liberation and the forming of a paternal-infant bond. They also examine attitudes toward breastfeeding in cultures all around the world as compared to the antipathy toward breastfeeding that pervades the United States. <i>Milk, Money, and Madness</i> cuts through the myths and paranoia to offer an enlightening, culturally significant look at one of the most fundamentally beautiful functions of the human experience.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.43 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",36.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/74/9780897894074.jpg,Success,104,18.6

Bitel Systematically Recovers The Almost-lost Society That Women And Men Created Together In Ireland. Europe Between The Coming Of Christianity And The Year 1000 Has Been Portrayed As A World Where Women Were Either Subservient To Men Or In Rebellion Against Them. Bitel Argues, However, That The Women And Men Of Early Medieval Ireland Did Not Always Submit To Patriarchal Ideals Of Institutionalized Oppression. Bitel Analyzes The Social Roles, Both Restrictive And Empowering, Played By Women In Ireland Between About 700 And 1100. She Focuses First On Sex, Love, Marriage, And Motherhood. She Examines The Economic Strategies That Women Developed And The Social Networks They Built In The Face Of Men's Desire To Restrict Their Mobility. In The Process, She Explains The Often Conflicting Ideas About Women Expressed By The Writers Of Medieval Irish Texts - A Small Group Of Literate Men Vowed To A Religion That Has Always Been Ambivalent Toward The Female Sex - Which Derived From Both Christian And Secular Celtic Heritages. She Concludes By Examining The Violent And Powerful Images Of Women Common In The Medieval Literature Of Ireland, Asking Why Men's Texts Consistently Depicted Women Negatively When Men And Women Interacted In A Wide Variety Of Ways. Ultimately, Bitel Maintains, Early Ireland Hosted A Set Of Gender Relations Every Bit As Flexible, Contradictory, And Complex As Our Own.--jacket. 1. The Texts And The Tellers Of Women's Tales -- 2.

In this study of American women's writings about the West between 1830 and 1930, a European scholar provides a reconstruction and new vision of frontier narrative from a perspective that has frequently been overlooked or taken for granted in discussions of the frontier. Brigitte Georgi-Findlay presents a range of writings that reflects the diversity of the western experience. Beginning with the narratives of Caroline Kirkland and other women of the early frontier, she reviews the diaries of the overland trails; letters and journals of the wives of army officers during the Indian wars; professional writings, focusing largely on travel, by women such as Caroline Leighton from the regional publishing cultures that emerged in the Far West during the last quarter of the century; and late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century accounts of missionaries and teachers on Indian reservations. Most of the writers were white, literate women who asserted their own kind of cultural authority over the lands and people they encountered. Their accounts are not only set in relation to a masculine frontier myth but also investigated for clues about their own involvement with territorial expansion. By exploring the various ways in which women writers actively contributed to and at times rejected the development of a national narrative of territorial expansion based on empire building and colonization, the author shows how their accounts are implicated in expansionist processes at the same time that they formulate positions of innocence and detachment. Georgi-Findlay has drawn on American studies scholarship, feminist criticism, and studies of colonial discourse to examine the strategies of women's representation in writing about the West in ways that most theorists have not. She critiques generally accepted stereotypes and assumptions—both about women's writing and its difference of view in particular, and about frontier discourse and the rhetoric of westward expansion in general—as she offers a significant contribution to literary studies of the West that will challenge scholars across a wide range of disciplines.</p>",en,3,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.212542441 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/74/9780816515974.jpg,Success,113,18.6

Nyeshangte women own land, control household money, and have the right to initiate divorce. Most important, they participate equally with men in central social institutions: international trade and Buddhist ritual practice. Spirited Women explores how the traditional culture of the Nyeshangte has confronted the changes brought about by modernization and the transition to a market economy, as the community has experienced a diaspora extending from the Himalayan highlands to such urban areas as Kathmandu, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Watkins argues that, while many studies have shown that capitalist development tends to lead to subordination of women, the Nyeshangte case demonstrates a marked divergence from this pattern. Because women are symbolically aligned with the domain of the sacred, their importance has actually increased in recent years, as the Nyeshangte struggle to reconcile their peaceful Buddhist tradition with the aggressive demands of the free market economy. In addition to its far-reaching exploration of women's agency in this small cultural group, Spirited Women looks into the lives of individual Nyeshangte men and women, both in their native Nepal and in the various urban centers where some have settled. Supplemented with photographs and regional maps, the first anthropological study of this fascinating cultural group adds an important chapter to the ethnographic record of Nepal.",en,1,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 6.06 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches",36,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/55/9780231102155.jpg,Success,107,18.6

For those qualified, the Guild was said to provide careers, security, and the chance for unimaginable wealth. But once you'd sung crystal, there was no going back. Killashandra's first season on Ballybran was everything she had hoped for: She had sung Black Crystal, grown wealthy, and met a man who could make her forget her own sorrowful past. But then, a year later, everything had changed. She was broke, she had crystal sickness so bad she thought she'd die, and the only way she could be true to the man she loved was to leave him. Crystal singing changed the singer forever, bringing ecstasy and pain, near-eternal life ... and gradual loss of memory. Killashandra had a lot of painful memories she could afford to lose. What she hadn't counted on was the loneliness she felt when her heart still remembered what her mind had forgotten. Then she found she might have a chance to salvage what was left of her mind. But to do that, she would have to learn to open herself - to another person, and to her own unhappy past.                        <p>Available for the first time in a single volume, the three complete adventures of Killashandra Ree, musician on the planet Ballybran, home of the fabled Black Crystal.

In this clear, helpful, and entertaining work, Drs. Rosalyn M. Meadow and Lillie Weiss reveal the conflict between sex and food - and their insights will free women from the damaging belief that self-denial is virtuous and that thinness equals happiness. For most women, the battle between self-restraint and indulgence is never-ending. Just as the cultural climate of the 1950s pressured women to repress their natural sexuality, today's culture pressures women to control their eating, to be unhealthily thin. Good Girls Don't Eat Dessert explores the connection between these major conflicts - to do it or not to do it and to eat or not to eat - and reveals that although the symptoms have changed, the cause remains the same: women are repressing their fundamental needs in order to be loved. An invaluable look at the psychological and cultural demands behind today's obsession with the perfect body, Good Girls Don't Eat Dessert will revolutionize the way women think about themselves and their basic needs for food, sex, and love. Most important, it provides essential and practical advice for all women - from the constantly dieting teenager to the Superwoman addicted to exercise - and will help them resolve their conflicts in positive and healthy ways.",en,"1st Edition, 1st Printing","Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/47/9780517703847.jpg,Success,117,18.6

When do they leave and why? Why do equally qualified girls and boys have such different experiences with science education? What are the patterns for women who stay in school and pursue a scientific career? What difference does family background make? Exactly how significant are differences of race and class? In Lost Talent, Hanson examines several unusually large and subtle, nationally representative, longitudinal data sets. The data includes information on a multitude of distinctions by race, class background, school experiences, and school resources, to name a few. Hanson examines this information with a particular focus on the differences in achievement within and across the disciplines, varying access to physical resources and differential activities in both math and science for young women in the education process. The challenge faced by the U.S. in the next two decades is developing a balanced, qualified, and well-trained workforce for jobs in science and other technical fields. For Hanson this includes equity for women, which begins with creating conditions so that young girls who start out doing well in science do not end up with little training and knowledge. The recovery of this ""lost talent"" is the central concern of this book.",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.46827866492 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",43.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/68/9781566394468.jpg,Success,113,18.6

Among The Chief Dictates Of Marianismo Are Self-sacrifice, Passivity, And Utter Submission To Male Authority. In The Old Country, Marianismo Afforded A Woman A Level Of Protection As Wife And Mother And Gave Her A Certain Power As Well As Respect.

When Latinas In North America Find Themselves Thus Conflicted Between Their Own Expectations Of A Woman's Life And Those Harbored By Their Families And Native Cultures, They Experience Crises Of Self-esteem - Which Are Actually Cultural Collisions.

King dazzles mystery lovers once again in this, her second Kate Martinelli mystery. The story unfolds as a band of homeless people cremate a beloved dog in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. When it comes to incidents like this, the authorities are willing to overlook a few broken regulations. But three weeks later, after the dog's owner gets the same fiery send-off, the SFPD knows it has a serious problem on its hands. Other than the fact that they're dealing with a particularly grisly homicide, Inspector Kate Martinelli and her partner, Al Hawkin, have little else to go on. They have a homeless victim without a positive ID, a group of witnesses who have little love for the cops, and a possible suspect, known only as Brother Erasmus. Kate learns that Erasmus is well-acquainted with the park's homeless and with the rarefied atmosphere of Berkeley's Graduate Theological Union, yet he remains an enigma to all. It's apparent that he is by no means crazy—but he is a fool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate begins the frustrating task of interrogating a man who communicates only through quotations. Trying to learn something of his history leads her along a twisting road to a disbanded cult, long-buried secrets, the thirst for spirituality, and the hunger for bloody vengeance.</p>

""What is revealed in this selection of letters is the extraordinary, private person of Carson and her relationship with Freeman, the nature-loving, homebody friend of her later years. . . . It is not often that a collection of letters reveals character, emotional depth, personality, indeed intellect and talent, as well as a full biography might; these letters do all that."" <br>
-Doris Grumbach, The New York Times Book Review

                        <p>Rachel Carson's landmark book Silent Spring set the modern environmental movement in motion. Now, this very special collection of letters from Rachel Carson to her Maine summer neighbor Dorothy Freeman offers an intimate, spellbinding look at Carson's private life and thought.

Crafted by an impressive range of scholars, the essays are empirically rich and theoretically cogent. But most important, they engage the complexities of multicultural, feminist, and multinational ethnographies and the stories that matter to politics, scholarship, and lives. With an ear for the tones of race and gender, this book answers the political, generic, and theoretical challenge of Writing Culture with layered essays that rewrite an important range of cultural conversations.""-Donna Haraway, author of Professor, History of Consciousness Board, UCSC 
<p>""Since the advent of the 'post-modern' in ethnography, we have been much in need of a marvelous volume such as this, placing 'woman' at the center of the debate. Women Writing Culture will prove as stimulating for our time as its great predecessor, Women, Culture and Society was for the 1970s.""-Jose E. Limon, University of Texas</p>
<p>""A groundbreaking book-provocative, illuminating, imaginative-and it is a pleasure to read. A trenchant yet always generous feminist critique of the masculinist bias in the theoretical canon of anthropological texts, it expansively and imaginatively maps the future directions of a feminist anthropology. In moving and courageous acts of reconstruction, the writers in this volume boldly cross disciplinary and generic lines, reading fiction as anthropology, writing theater as ethnography, getting personal, radically reconceiving the relationship of self and other and, thereby, the field itself. Feminist scholars of all disciplines will find hereenabling textual and conceptual strategies as well as memorable voices and powerful stories.""-Marianne Hirsch, Dartmouth College, author of The Mother-Daughter Plot</p>

Both policymakers and activists were concerned not only with stopping the spread of the disease, but also with guiding the public's response toward those already infected. Fatal Advice is an examination of how the nation attempted, with mixed results, to negotiate the fears and concerns brought on by the epidemic. A leading writer on the cultural politics of AIDS, Cindy Patton guides us through the thicket of mass-media productions, policy and public health enterprises, and activist projects as they sprang up to meet the challenge of the epidemic, shaping the nation's notion of what safe-sex is and who ought to know what about it.
<p>There is the official story, and then there is another, involving local groups and AIDS activists. Going back to early government and activist attempts to spread information, Patton traces a slow separation between official advice and that provided by those on the front lines in the battle against AIDS. She shows how American anxieties about teen sex played into the nation's inadequate education and protection of its young people, and chronicles the media's attempts to encourage compassion without broaching the touchy subject of sex or disrupting the notion that AIDS was a disease of social and sexual outcasts. Her overview of the relationship between shifting medical perceptions and safe-sex advice reveals why radical safe-sex educators eventually turned to sexually explicit, including pornographic, representations to spread their message-and why even these extreme tactics could not overcome the misguided national teaching on AIDS.</p>

Today, discussions of lesbian sex abound with such terms as romantic friendships, stealth lesbians, and genitally sexual. As we approach the end of the twentieth century, lesbian sexuality remains hotly contested ground. What exactly qualifies as lesbian sex? What is the relationship, if any, between lesbian erotica and heterosexual pornography? How did the issue of sex in lesbian communities come to be such a fiercely debated subject?</p>
<p><i>Lesbian Erotics</i> is the first anthology to investigate the cultural production of sexually charged images of lesbians in film, law, literature, and popular culture in general. The contributors address an enormous range of sexualities and fora in which these sexualities flourish. In her chapter, <i>Not Tonight, Dear, I'm Deconstructing a Headache: Confessions of a Lesbian Sex Therapist</i>, Marny Hall illustrates how difficult some women find it to maintain erotic tension in lesbian relationships. Elizabeth Meese grapples with increasingly complex sexual identities in cyperspace. Kitty Tsui, cover model for <i>On Our Backs</i>, relays how she developed her own body into an art form in order to combat stereotypes of passive and invisible Asian women.</p>
<p>This work, as Karla Jay writes in the introduction, invites readers to consider the implications, variations, and complexities of lesbian erotics. In the end, it is our sexual lives that mark us as outlaws. Therefore, we need to investigate and engage representations of our sexuality to define for ourselves, if we so choose, the scope, shape, and permutations of lesbian erotics.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.85098433132 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/59/9780814742259.jpg,Success,109,18.6

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a childhood in a wealthy but troubled family, Maimie's struggle for survival began at age 13 following years of apparent incestuous abuse. Her descent led her through reformatories, jails, and hospitals. It also brought her into contact with a sometimes colorful, sometimes grim assortment of people living on the edge, whose miseries and hopes she depicts with a true writer's gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the intervention of a devoted social worker and the support of Fanny Quincy Howe-and despite experiences of sexual harrasment-Maimie is able, during the course of her correspondence, to leave prostitution and learn secretarial skills. With these skills-and with her talent for management, her street wisdom, and her compassion-Maimie becomes a kind of self-invented social worker, eventually providing shelter and services to street women in Montreal. The final letters in 1922 find Maimie happily married, mother to two adopted children, intent upon publishing her writing-and as indefatigable as ever.</p>

This magisterial biography demonstrates the epic scale of his achievement, as well as the dreams and anxieties that impelled it, for it places the poet securely within the political and cultural context of his age.</p>
<p>Combing through the full range of Whitman's writing, David Reynolds shows how Whitman gathered inspiration from every stratum of nineteenth-century American life: the convulsions of slavery and depression; the raffish dandyism of the Bowery ""b'hoys""; the exuberant rhetoric of actors, orators, and divines. We see how Whitman reconciled his own sexuality with contemporary social mores and how his energetic courtship of the public presaged the vogues of advertising and celebrity. Brilliantly researched, captivatingly told, <b>Walt Whitman's America</b> is a triumphant work of scholarship that breathes new life into the biographical genre.</p>


                        <p>This comprehensive, original portrait of the life and work of one of America's greatest poets--set in the social, cultural, and political context of his time--considers the full range of writings by and about Whitman, his early poems and stories, his conversations, letters, journals, newspaper writings, and daybooks.

One Of The Stories, Roselily, An Interior Monolog Of A Poor, Mississippi Girl (an Unwed Mother) As She Is Being Married And Taken Away To Chicago Like Chattel, Was Deemed Anti-religious. The Other Story, Am I Blue?, Is An Allegory Of Slavery Told By A Narrator Observing The Treatment Of A Horse; The Story's Ending Holds Emotional Associations Of Eating Animal Products With Cruelty And Was Thus Marked Anti-meat-eating. Here, In Time For Banned Books Week, The Two Stories Are Reprinted In Full, Along With An Excerpt From Walker's Other Much-censored Book, The Color Purple.

<p>Kat Colorado knows the dangers of letting a case get too big a piece of your soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;But some cases don't give you a choice, like the death of twenty-two-year-old Courtney Dillard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat found her battered body on a dark Sacramento freeway, an apparent hit-and-run victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Courtney's mother is convinced her death was no accident, and hires Kat to find the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;As sweet and good-hearted as she was, Courtney had no shortage of enemies, Kat learns. And they make no secret of their belief in blood vengeance.</p>
<p>Kat's also looking for the truth about her relationship with Hank, who's wrestling with his own soul-eating case.&nbsp;&nbsp;A serial killer is stalking the Vegas Strip, and Hank's investigation is taking him over the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;His obsession could cost him both Kat and his career—while Kat's could cost her her life.</p>


                        <p>A hard-boiled Sacramento P.I. with a soft spot for the unlucky, the unloved and one special cop named Hank, Kat Colorado finds herself a little too involved in the suspicious hit-and-run death of Courtney Dillard. Digging into the investigation, Kat discovers that Courtney had no shortage of enemies--and they make no secret of their belief in blood vengeance.

Sharing with postmodernism a suspicion of totalizing forms of knowledge and practice, Wendy Farley parts with postmodernism in defending the possibility of truth and ethics. Arguing that reality occurs in the concrete existence of actual beings (human and otherwise), she develops an interpretation of the nature of knowledge as an eros for the other—as an openness to the distinctive beauties and fragilities of other creatures.</p>
<p>Employing Plato, Levinas, Hannah Arendt, Iris Murdoch, Anne Carson, and representatives of Continental philosophy and feminist theory, <em>Eros for the Other</em> constructs an original argument for the interdependence of truth, ethics, and pluralism. Through dialogues with Western thought and its critics an original vision emerges of the way reason discerns reality, experiences beauty, and lives compassionately in the midst of the plurality of concrete, historical existence.</p>",en,n,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.66 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/00/9780271015200.jpg,Success,112,18.6

Marek,University Press of Kentucky,264,10/12/1995,,Paperback,"<p><p>for Many Years Young Writers Experimenting With Forms And Aesthetics In The Early Decades Of This Century, Small Journals Known Collectively As Little Magazines Were The Key To Recognition. Joyce, Stein, Eliot, Pound, Hemingway, And Scores Of Other Iconoclastic Writers Now Considered Central To Modernism Received Little Encouragement From The Established Publishers. It Was The Avant-garde Magazines, Many Of Them Headed By Women, That Fostered New Talent And Found A Readership For It. Jayne Marek Examines The Work Of Seven Women Editors &#151; Harriet Monroe, Alice Corbin Henderson, Margaret Anderson, Jane Heap, H.d., Bryher (winifred Ellerman), And Marianne Moore &#151; Whose Varied Activities, Often Behind The Scenes And In Collaboration With Other Women, Contributed Substantially To The Development Of Modernist Literature. Through Such Publications As Poetry, The Little Review, The Dial, And Close Up, These Women Had A Profound Influence That Has Been Largely Overlooked By Literary Historians. Marek Devotes A Chapter As Well To The Interactions Of These Editors With Ezra Pound, Who Depended Upon But Also Derided Their Literary Tastes And Accomplishments. Pound's Opinions Have Had Lasting Influence In Shaping Critical Responses To Women Editors Of The Early Twentieth Century. In The Current Reevaluation Of Modernism, This Important Book, Long Overdue, Offers An Indispensable Introduction To The Formative Influence Of Women Editors, Both Individually And In Their Collaborative Efforts. Jayne Marek Is Associate Professor Of English At Franklin College.</p><h3>library Journal</h3><p>focusing On The Role Of Seven American And English Women In Editing And Publishing Influential Avant-garde Literary Journals In The Early Decades Of The 20th Century, Marek, A Fulbright Fellow In Hungary, Argues That Women Were More Instrumental In The Evolution Of Modernism Than Is Generally Acknowledged. She Devotes Individual Chapters To Harriet Monroe, Founder Of Poetry (in 1912), And Her First Coeditor, Alice Corbin Henderson; Margaret Anderson And Jane Heap, Editors Of The Little Review (1914-29); And Marianne Moore, Editor Of The Dial (1925-29), Among Others. In The Final Chapter, Marek Explores Interactions Between The Women Editors And The Male Literary Establishment, Specifically Regarding Ezra Pound. Although A Few Of Marek's Interpretations May Be Questioned, The Overall Evidence That Women Editors Played An Important Role In Promoting Critical Dialog, New Ideas, And New Literature Cannot Be Denied. This Important Scholarly Study Provides The Groundwork For Further Research.jeris Cassel, Rutgers Univ.

In A Mixture Of Personal Experiences And Political Analysis, Brownworth Exposes A Vast Array Of American Social Evilsfrom Homelessness To The Oklahoma Bombingsand Offers A Radical Queer Reading Of Each. The Results Are Varied. Her Strongest Arguments Effectively Rebut Writers Like Bruce Bawer (a Place At The Table) And Andrew Sullivan (virtually Normal) Whose Integrationist Politics, Brownworth Argues, Are Ultimately Self-loathing And Potentially Disastrous To The Queer Community.

This holds especially true for gay and lesbian people around the world as they face overt and frequent social and political barriers and alienation. In Gays and Lesbians in Asia and the Pacific, people from Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore share their unique experiences of the gay and lesbian communities and available social services. Unlike previous writings on homosexuality in the region, written by Westerners, this book offers new perspectives from ”insiders” of the cultures who speak from their own lived experiences. The chapters show the changing situations in each country and provide insight into the contemporary issues surrounding gay and lesbian life in these countries.</p>
<p>The authors of Gays and Lesbians in Asia and the Pacific collectively address the issues of self-recognition, legal status, freedom of choice, health, and social and information needs in the context of gay and lesbian people in particular cultures. They are concerned with forms of social services rather than sexual practices or institutionalized or traditional expressions of homosexuality. Topics covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>social services and health care accessibility for gay men and lesbians</li>
<li>the impact of AIDS on gay life</li>
<li>law enforcement, police harassment, and the decriminalization of homosexuality</li>
<li>gay rights</li>
<li>gay and lesbian families and communities</li>
<li>the gay press in Japan and Asia 
<p>Gays and Lesbians in Asia and the Pacific is a timely and important contribution to the study of contemporary issues related to homosexuality, broadening the focus from local matters to a regional perspective. It stresses the need, in many parts of the Asia-Pacific region for legal reform and changes in social attitudes toward homosexuality, not only to remove sodomy statutes where they exist, but also to ensure freedom from discrimination, equality of opportunity, parenting and inheritance rights, and the whole host of issues which Western gay rights activists pursue.</p>
<p>The book’s focus on AIDS is a reflection of the emergence of AIDS as a social phenomenon which makes new demands on the gay community and offers new avenues for the development of gay and lesbian social services. Chapters focus on AIDS as providing a window of opportunity for gay organizations to be active in countries where there is strong government or social disapproval of homosexuality. One given example is Singapore, where gay and lesbian organizations are allowed to function as long as they are officially recognized as providing services such as AIDS prevention and education or safe sex promotion.</p>
<p>Readers of Gays and Lesbians in Asia and the Pacific will understand a great deal more about the day-to-day experiences of homosexuals in the Asia-Pacific region. The book is a helpful tool for sociologists, anthropologists, social workers, and those in the social sciences aiming to broaden their understanding of the gay experience. It may also be important reading material for students of Gay and Lesbian Studies, Asian Studies, public health, social work, anthropology, and sociology.</p>

According to Kack-Brice, a California clinical social worker, memories of grandmothers, whether positive or negative, are a powerful connection to childhood, and the exploration of these reminiscences can lead to deeper self-knowledge. Many of the selections, including the poetry of Marge Piercy and Linda Hogan and memoirs by Ethel Barrymore and Maya Angelou, evoke grandmothers as figures of strength and inspiration. Other contributors, such as M.F.K. Fisher and Stephanie Patterson, describe more troubled relationships with their grandmothers. A touching selection by Jewelle Gomez recalls how her grandmother accepted her lesbianism. Exercises for the reader who wants to write about her own grandmother are provided by the contributors.
