young women, dykey-looking women, and just about heat, sun, humidity or neglect? Are there empty pock-
every other kind of woman who’s not white, long- ets in your racks? Are horizontal images stuffed in
legged, and draped in expensive looking clothing?
And yet, as feminist bookstore workers, many of
us are guilty of perpetuating the same lack of imagery
that we abhor. How, you ask, can it be so?
I's simple. In just about every feminist bookstore
that I’ve ever entered, from California to New York and
many points in between, the opportunity to display all
kinds of wonderful imagery of women is lost. Imagery
that could validate a woman's existence. Imagery that
could make a woman laugh, or even cry. And imagery,
quite frankly, that could be making you a profit, but is not.
The imagery I'm speaking of, if you haven't figured
it out already, is the kind on postcards and notecards that
could be filling your store. True, most women’s book-
stores do have card racks. I usually spot them first thing
when I enter a store, and it'll be me who fusses over them,
tidying them up, until my lover pulls me away hissing,
“You're not working now!” But are your cards up to
speed? There’s one easy way to find out: take my simple

handbook in natural rhythm. It’s a way of life! In-
cludes: week-at-a-glance, daily astrological aspects,
daily moon phases and signs, and astrological predic-
tions for each zodiac sign. The 1996 theme is Earth
Matters. It’s filled with powerful and unique art and
writing about the physical plane, the earth and how
she matters! We'Moon 96's eco-inspired theme is very
timely. See ad page 23.
