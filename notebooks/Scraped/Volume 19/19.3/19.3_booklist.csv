0-7892-0281-6,Mother and Daughter Tales (Abbeville Anthology),"Evetts-Secker, Josephine",Abbeville Kids,80,9/1/1996,,Hardcover,"<p>Gathered from around the world, these ten tales celebrate the special relationship between mothers and daughters. While the stories come from a wide variety of cultures and time periods, themes such as honesty, independence, and love act as a common thread. Watercolor illustrations light up this unusual collection.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Part of the Abbeville Anthology series, this pedestrian retelling of 10 folktales from around the world, all about mothers and daughters, is given a critical boost by Cann's luxuriant illustrations. Evetts-Secker's foreword and endnotes founder with the weight of jargon and specious pronouncements: ""The godmother is not an actual goddess, but carries similar energy, compensating for the spiritual poverty of the girl's birth mother,"" or ""[the stories] reflect what it is to be a natural and spiritual woman."" Including familiar stories from European traditions as well as less well-known Chinese, Iroquois and Turkish tales, the retellings often rely on clichs. In the space of a few sentences, for example, the author describes how nymphs ""fled in fright,"" as Demeter, whose heart is ""froze[n] with fear,"" is also ""frantic with fear."" Cann's delicate watercolors include an inviting montage of motifs from various cultures. Surrounding each tale are intricate borders that feature, variously, red Chinese dragons, pale Japanese apple blossoms or vivid Eastern European embroidery patterns. While her figures occasionally look stiff or awkward, Cann's strong and inventive designs seem to burst from each page. Ages 6-12.

In historical context, with special emphasis on matters of race and gender, are the words of luminaries like Zora Neale Hurston and Georgia Douglas Johnson as well as rare, previously unpublished writings by figures like Angelina Weld Grimk&eacute;, Elise Johnson McDougald, and Regina Andrews, all culled from archives and arcane magazines.<P>Editors Lorraine Elena Roses and Ruth Elizabeth Randolph arrange their selections to reveal not just the little-suspected extent of black women's writing, but its prodigious existence beyond the cultural confines of New York City. <i>Harlem's Glory</i> also shows how literary creativity often coexisted with social activism in the works of African-American women.<P>This volume is full of surprises about the power and diversity of the writers and genres. The depth, the wit, and the reach of the selections are astonishing. With its wealth of discoveries and rediscoveries, and its new slant on the familiar, all elegantly presented and deftly edited, the book will compel a reassessment of writing by African-American women and its place in twentieth-century American literary and historical culture.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This book is a treasure. It is an incredibly rich amalgam of prose, poetry, non-fiction and fiction that readers will adore, with unifying commentary, footnotes and illustrated biographies that scholars will respect. It includes rare things, unpublished manuscripts, the words of self-educated women and the collective memory of their men and children. The authors (who also collaborated on Harlem Renaissance and Beyond: Literary Biographies of 100 Black Women Writers, 1900-1945) opted not to evaluate the pieces for ""quality,"" but instead chose those that struck them as ""vivid and memorable,"" and as contributing to the project overall. The result is a collection of great diversity that still speaks fully to the African American experience of racial hypocrisy and unity, of solidarity between black women and white, of the intellectual lives of those who've had a book in hand but no bread on the table. Every reader will have several favorites. Zora Neale Hurston and Dorothy West are here, but so are Nat Turner's granddaughter and a woman who worked her way around the world as a domestic. Roses, director of Latin American studies at Wellesley, and Randolph, an independent scholar, have also provided a context in which the work of all black writers of the period, but especially women, can be viewed as part of a rich tradition rather than a short-lived fluke of history in a crowded corner of one northern city.

Thousands are herded onto slave ships headed for the intergalactic auction block.<P>Kris Bjornsen is captured in Denver on her way to her college classes and wakes up on the primitive planet Barevi. Courageous and resourceful, she manages a single-woman escape from the Catteni and is living in the wilds of the planet when she comes to the aid of a Catteni soldier pursued by his own ranks. Recaptured together, they join forces with other slaves to outwit their captors and a hostile planetary environment.<P>Listeners will delight in this ""against-the-odds"" story of survival, ingenuity and romance. As her audience has come to expect of McCaffrey, she delivers a rich and intricate science fiction adventure in Freedom's Landing, sure to win over even more listeners and add to her legions of fans.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In Freedom's Landing (1995), a group of plucky slaves, both human and alien, were abandoned by their Catteni masters on the planet Botany. With the help of the Catteni rebel Zainal, the colonists survived their early days, and now they're making plans to get even with the Catteni as well as to learn the truth about the mysterious Farmers, or Mech Makers, who seem to be cultivating Botany by means of robots. Told mostly from the point of view of Zainal's human lover, Kris Bjornsen, the plot focuses on the colonists' struggle to survive independent of their Catteni overlords. Though a few settlers want to return to Earth to fight the Catteni, most of the women seem bent on having children and making a real go of the colony. While this wholesale enthusiasm to procreate stretches credulity, McCaffrey's characters are otherwise her usual well-tempered mix of heroes, rogues and out-and-out villains. The setting is crisp and expertly detailed and the plot spins out smoothly, with more than enough hints of future developments to keep readers eager for the next installment in the series.

Once at Owatonna, Patty was separated from her sister and brother, was sexually abused by the school janitor, and contracted tuberculosis. She was placed in two foster homes where she endured a variety of emotional and physical abuses. Eventually adopted at the age of seven, she would not see her sister again for more than thirty years. Through her late childhood and teen years Patty learned to negotiate the shoals of life as an adoptee - striving for full membership in the family, repressing her anger at being forbidden to discuss her past, wondering what became of her sister, brother, mother, and father. As a young woman coming of age she grew to appreciate the good things her adoptive family offered her even while holding on to a sense of self they wanted her to suppress. Patty's Journey is a richly textured account of people struggling through the Great Depression and war years, but it also illuminates the customs and small victories of that era, often in surprising and humorous ways. Although it provides a disturbing look at child-rearing practices in state orphanages at the time, it is ultimately a redemptive tale of one woman's bravery in facing her past - and moving ahead toward a future that included both her selves.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/67/9780816628667.jpg,Success,122,19.3

The major issue is difference: sexual, cultural and social. Generations points to the singularity of each artist's creative negotiation of time and historical and political circumstance; Geographies calls attention to the significance of place, location and cultural diversity, connecting issues of sexuality to those of nationality, imperialism, migration, diaspora and genocide. Generations and Geographies is framed by theoretical debates in cultural analysis by Griselda Pollock, Mieke Bal, Elisabeth Bronfen and Irit Rogoff, and two historical analyses of representations of the female nude by Rosemary Betterton and Nanette Salomon. Essays on international contemporary art discuss artistic practice by women working in both western and non-western contexts, focusing on themes of the mother, the body, the land and history/memory. The artists discussed include the French performance artist Orlan, the Cuban American artist Ana Mendieta and Jenny Saville from Britain, the Chilean artist Cecilia Vicuna, Shimada Yoshiko from Japan, the Korean artist Re-Hyun Park and the Korean/Canadian artist Jin-me Yoon, Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger from Israel and the American artist Cindy Sherman.

A law-abiding citizen broods over his pleasure in violent, illegal acts. A prison warden loses his job because he is so successful in rehabilitating criminals.

In developing her unique vision, Duncan draws on literature, history, psychoanalysis, and law. Her work reveals a nonutopian world in which criminals and non-criminals--while injuring each other in obvious ways--nonetheless live together in a symbiotic as well as an adversarial relationship, needing each other, serving each other, enriching each other's lives in profound and surprising fashion.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",65,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/03/9780814718803.jpg,Success,140,19.3

She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide.</p>
<p>Then out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.</p>
<p>Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future.</p>
<p>But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents—Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be...</p>

At the end of their trip, their passengers - Lewis Hayden and his family - remained in southern Ohio, ticketed for the Underground Railroad. Webster and Fairbank returned to a near riot and jail cells. Webster earned a sentence to the state penitentiary in Frankfort, where the warden, Newton Craig, married and a father, became enamored of her and was tempted into a compromising relationship he would come to regret. Hayden reached freedom in Boston, where he became a prominent businessman, the ringleader in the courthouse rescue of a fugitive slave, and the last link in the chain of events that led to the Harpers Ferry Raid. Webster, the focal point at which these lives intersect, remains an enigma. Was she, as one contemporary noted, ""a young lady of irreproachable character""? Or, as another observed, ""a very bold and defiant kind of woman, without a spark of feminine modesty, and, withal, very shrewd and cunning""?

Waldby argues that much AIDS discourse relies on an implicit and unconscious equation between sexual health and heterosexual masculinity. In this equation women, bisexuals and gay men are the targets of preventative programs, while heterosexual men remain unaddressed.<br> <br> Drawing upon examples of preventative policies from Australia, Britain and the USA, Waldby investigates the concept of public health and questions exactly whose interests are represented in a ""healthy society"". <b></b><b><i>AIDS and the Body Politic</i></b> demonstrates the extent to which established ideas about the virus, the immune system, the HIV test and the epidemiology of the disease rely upon unexamined and conservative assumptions about sexual identity and sexual difference.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.64815905028 Pounds, Width: 0.42 Inches",48.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/07/9780415141307.jpg,Success,134,19.3

Though many see it as a social and political problem grounded in unequal gender roles, this level of analysis fails to explain adequately why many battered women return to their abusers despite intense suffering and the certainty of more physical violence.</p><p>The Illusion of Love challenges the prevailing model, which views the victim of abuse as a normal woman who is unable to escape from her batterer due to the effects of terror and psychological collapse. Instead, David Celani offers a new answer--that women who are battered have a fundamental attraction to partners who are abusive.</p><p>Based on his years of clinical experience treating battered women, Celani applies object relations theory and case examples from his own practice to show that many women--and indeed some men--are unconsciously drawn to abusive partners because of personality disorders caused by childhood abuse and neglect. He argues that any effective treatment for battered women must help unravel futile and self-defeating patterns, such as ones that spring from fears of abandonment and fascination with men who produce exaggerated promises of love followed by extreme rejecting behaviors.</p><p><i>The Illusion of Love</i> examines the personalities of abusers as well, many of whom suffer from narcissism, a disorder that is also often associated with childhood abuse and neglect. Narcissistic men lash out violently in an attempt to control their own fears or abandonment and to compensate for unsatisfied emotional needs.</p><p>Celani concludes that domestic violence is often the tragic result of a union between individuals with complementary personality disorders. His findings fly in the face of the politically correct refusal to examine the behavior of the victim of abuse, a strategy that has led to a severe misunderstanding of the dynamics of the battering scenario. <i>The Illusion of Love</i> calls for primary prevention of neglectful parenting to stem the tide of abuse in the future, offering tangible hope for the treatment of victims of abuse as they attempt to extricate themselves from unhealthy, damaging relationships.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>",en,1st Edition,"Height: 0.54 Inches, Length: 9.03 Inches, Weight: 0.71 Pounds, Width: 6 Inches",99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/73/9780231100373.jpg,Success,115,19.3

Heir to Langston Hughes's deceptively ordinary voice, Clifton crafts brief lines and accessible metaphors into a profound and often humorous commentary on the rich survival skills of women, family love and contemporary Americanparticularly African Americanlife. Her cogent 10th collection charts a treacherous terrain of personal and historic tragedy. She confronts breast cancer with an impressive delicacy, as in ""scar"": ""I will call you/ ribbon of hunger/ and desire/ empty pocket flap/ edge of before and after.// and you/ what will you call me?"" A poetic sequence called ""A Term in Memphis"" penetrates Southern history, allowing the revelations of honest anger to operate as antidotenot comfortfor bigotry. Often drawn to religious themes, Clifton ambitiously explores contradictions of the Bible's King David, a poet and a soldier who ""stands in the tents of history/ bloody skull in one hand, harp in the other...."" With her sustaining ability to spin pain into beauty, Clifton redeems the human spirit from its dark moments. She is among our most trustworthy and gifted poets.

Diamond, B.s.n., R.n., Shares A Unique, Insider's View Of Childbirth. Diamond's Lifetime Of Experience - As A Prepared-childbirth Instructor, As An Obstetrical Nurse Who Spent Nearly A Decade Working On Labor And Delivery Wards, And As A Mother Of Two - Has Given Her An Unmatched Perspective On Giving Birth And On The Impact Of Modern Medicine On This Most Special Time For Mother And Child. Too Often In American Hospitals Today, The Process Of Labor And Delivery Is Treated As An Illness, Not As A Natural, If Life-altering, Event. Women Are Dehumanized By Artificially Established Labor Curves And Confined By Often-unnecessary Machinery; Their Personal Needs, Even Their Privacy, Subsumed Under The Rules Of The System. Fear Of Malpractice Has Added To The Rigidity Of The System - But So Has A Lack Of True Caring And A Fondness For Expediency. Diamond's Vision Of Childbirth As A Natural, Normal Event, One That Should Be Enhanced, Not Corrupted, By Modern Medicine, Shines From Every Page Of This Powerful, Emotionally Evocative Work. Hard Labor Introduces Readers To Dozens Of Mothers, Fathers, And Families, And Reveals The Wide Spectrum Of Triumph And Tragedy That Fills Labor And Delivery Wards. Diamond's Fellow Nurses, And The Doctors With Whom They Work, Also Spring To Life In Her Vivid Recountings Of Medical Disasters And Miracles.

Regardless Of Hiv Status, All Are Called On To Maintain Vigilant Safety With Sex, To Face Down A Cultural Stigma Greater Even Than Homophobia, And To Somehow Find A Way To Go Forward In A World Heavy With Loss. At Long Last, Current Medical Breakthroughs Offer The Hope Of Changing The Face Of The Epidemic, But The Psychological Crisis Continues. New Infections Are On The Rise Among Young Gay Men. Exhaustion And Grief Threaten To Overwhelm The Activism And Optimism Of Earlier Years. In A World Turned Upside Down, The Challenge Of Finding Meaning Is More Than An Idle Philosophical Exercise. It Is A Matter Of Psychological And Perhaps Even Physical Survival. Dr. Steven Schwartzberg Grounds His Insights In His Own Experiences As A Gay Man And As A Practicing Psychotherapist, And In In-depth Interviews With Nineteen Men Living With Hiv. Ranging In Age From Twenty-seven To Fifty, The Men Include A Construction Foreman, A Physician, An Art Historian, A Waiter, A Librarian, And A Licensed Massage Therapist. With Candor, Insight, Eagerness, And A Remarkable Ability To Share Of Themselves, They Speak Eloquently About How Hiv Has Affected Their Views Of The World, Their Senses Of Themselves, And How They Live Their Lives. Interweaving The Men's Stories With Observations From His Research And Clinical Practice, Schwartzberg Bears Witness To The Remarkable Transformations Some Men Have Accomplished, And The Anguish Of Meaninglessness That Weighs Others Down. He Strives To Uncover Why Some View Hiv As A Catalyst For Change Or Growth, While Others See It Only As Punishment. And Though He Passes No Judgment On The Coping Strategies He Describes, Schwartzberg Does Insist On The Vital Necessity Of Balancing Somber Reality With Healing, Life-sustaining Hope. He Argues That Men Who Opt For Too Much Illusion And Too Little Reality Risk Shoddy Self-care And Inadequate Preparation For The Future, While Those Who Find No Escape From Reality May Teeter Into Rage Or Suicidal Despair.--jacket. 1.

Stuffed inside a black lace stocking, the letters were hidden under the floorboards of a house in Northampton, Massachusetts, until their recent discovery. Reflecting the passions and anxieties of the moment, the letters were written by Alice Hanley, the daughter of Irish Catholic immigrants, to Channing Lewis, a cook in Springfield. Since the thoughts and feelings of women like Hanley have usually been filtered through middle-class reformers, her words provide a rare window into a realm of American social life seldom explored by historians. The letters are accompanied by essays that skillfully probe their larger meanings. Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz introduces the letters, placing them in the context of their time, while journalist Phoebe Rolin Mitchell recounts the story of their discovery. Kathy Peiss explores Hanley's life, her negotiation of illicit love, and her desire for respectability, re-creating a dense and textured world of home, church, and town. Historian Louis Wilson unearths the trail left by Lewis and members of his extended family in Springfield. Reviewing the experiences of African Americans in that city, Wilson clarifies the economic, social, and political position of a black, middle-aged breadwinner during the difficult years of the early twentieth century.",en,,"Height: 9.04 Inches, Length: 5.51 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/46/9781558490246.jpg,Success,121,19.3

Growing up in a refugee family, Estes learns the art of storytelling in the ancient tradition. In graceful prose, she relates the story of her Hungarian Uncle Zovar, a concentration camp survivor, in his struggle to release himself from the horrors of camp life. A story within a story is illustrated through the uncle's narration of the burning death and rebirth of his forest during World War II. Estes includes her own rendition of the Christmas tree story: the tree in the forest cut down, adorned at the house, then burned as firewood in the end. She relates the story of her own urban forest started in her back yard, inspired by her uncle's thoughts on nature. Estes's style is charming, spellbinding, and lyrical.

Many a home swarmed with flies, barnyard animals, dust, and dirt; clothes were seldom washed; men hardly ever shaved or bathed. Yet gradually all this changed, and today, Americans are known worldwide for their obsession with cleanliness-for their sophisticated plumbing, daily bathing, shiny hair and teeth, and spotless clothes. In <b>Chasing Dirt</b>, Suellen Hoy provides a colorful history of this remarkable transformation from dreadfully dirty to cleaner than clean, ranging from the pre-Civil War era to the 1950s, when American's obsession with cleanliness reached its peak.<br>Hoy offers here a fascinating narrative, filled with vivid portraits of the men and especially the women who helped America come clean. She examines the work of early promoters of cleanliness, such as Catharine Beecher and Sylvester Graham; and describes how the Civil War marked a turning point in our attitudes toward cleanliness, discussing the work of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, headed by Frederick Law Olmsted, and revealing how the efforts of Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War inspired American women-such as Dorothea Dix, Clara Barton, and Louisa May Alcott-to volunteer as nurses during the war. We also read of the postwar efforts of George E. Waring, Jr., a sanitary engineer who constructed sewer systems around the nation and who, as head of New York City's street-cleaning department, transformed the city from the nation's dirtiest to the nation's cleanest in three years. Hoy details the efforts to convince African-Americans and immigrants of the importance of cleanliness, examining the efforts of Booker T. Washington (who preached the gospel of the toothbrush), Jane Addams at Hull House, and Lillian Wald at the Henry Street Settlement House. Indeed, we see how cleanliness gradually shifted from a way to prevent disease to a way to assimilate, to become American. And as the book enters the modern era, we learn how advertising for soaps, mouth washes, toothpastes, and deodorants in mass-circulation magazines showed working men and women how to cleanse themselves and become part of the increasingly sweatless, odorless, and successful middle class. Shower for success!<br> By illuminating the historical roots of America's shift from dreadfully dirty to squeaky clean, <b>Chasing Dirt</b> adds a new dimension to our understanding of our national culture. And along the way, it provides colorful and often amusing social history as well as insight into what makes Americans the way we are today.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 0.78 Inches, Length: 8.54 Inches, Weight: 0.55336027762 Pounds, Width: 5.62 Inches",27.83,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/86/9780195111286.jpg,Success,119,19.3

Ortega's party, the Sandinistas, controlled the country, except for the Catholic Church and Mrs. Chamorro's newspaper, La Prensa, which, virtually alone, predicted the outcome accurately. After the election, many doubted that the Sandinistas would permit Mrs. Chamorro to take office, but she did, thanks in no small part to her own canny political instincts in reaching out to the Sandinistas rather than retaliating against them for causing a decade of oppression and poverty. After six years in office she has brought her country back from ruin, ending a civil war and revitalizing an economy that had become the second worst in the Western Hemisphere. Perhaps most remarkable of all, Mrs. Chamorro had never held office before, and from childhood had had no other aspiration than to raise a family. Although written by a sitting president, this is a memoir like no other - intensely personal and deeply moving. President Chamorro explains that her lack of political experience left her to govern by the model she knew best, raising a family. Her own children were politically divided, like her country, and she tried to keep communication open among them. She did the same for what she calls her family of Nicaragua, reconciling left and right whenever possible, trying to put past political turmoil behind her. Devoted to the memory of her martyred husband, committed to her religious faith and her faith in democracy, Violeta Chamorro has ruled from the heart and led her country from disaster to recovery.                        <p>Interesting if self-serving memoir by former president of Nicaragua, 'always guided by the selfless desire to improve the lot of [her] countrymen.' Details workings of non-Sandinista opposition to Somoza through 1979, and conflicts during 1980s between right and Sandinista regime.

These stories and poems speak straight to the hearts of the vast baby boomer generation, reflecting their personal experiences as they turn fifty, and exploring the future terrain of old age.<p>In the enriching tradition of her million-copy bestseller, When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple, Sandra Haldeman Martz rewards us with her latest celebration of aging&#58; Grow Old Along with Me -- The Best is Yet to Be. This outstanding anthology shares poignant experiences of growing old from the perspectives of both women and men.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>""The need to be loved, the importance of family connections, an acceptance of the aging process,"" are all concerns of the contributors to this new collection by the editor of the Abby-winning When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple. These poems, short fiction and photos by men and women over 50, are written from experience and from the heart. In many cases, they pinpoint for an instant exactly how it feels to be older. In some, the best has already been, as in the devastating ""Choices"" by Nancy Robertson and ""Can Opener"" by Dianna Henning, two deceptively simple poems. But the romance of Anne C. Barnhill's story, ""Washing Helen's Hair,"" the surprise of Peter Meinke's ""A Woman Like That,"" and the guts and energy of ""Aerodynamic Integrity"" by Rose Hamilton-Gottlieb show a wealth of posibilities ahead. Each piece can be enjoyed for itself, but together they speak well for a growing but overlooked population. The many photos throughout show strength, resilience and devotion. Sooner or later, if they're lucky, everyone moves into this stage of life. And, as many of these writers point out, they're still the same inside, only the packaging has changed. Borrowing the title from Robert Browning, quoted at the beginning, may seem a bit cheeky, but in this case it fits. 100,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; 15-city author tour.

1-55861-160-6,Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology,,The Feminist Press at CUNY,832,11/1/1996,,Paperback,"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sisterhood Is Global</i> has been revered as the essential feminist text on the international women's movement since its first appearance, when it was hailed as ""a historic publishing event."" The anthology features original essays Morgan commissioned from a deliberately eclectic mix of women both famous and less known-grass-roots activisits, politicians, scholars, querillas, novelists, social scientists, and journalists-representing 70 countries, from every region and political system, with particular emphasis on the Global South. These truth-telling, impassioned essays celebrate the diversity as well as the similarity of women's experience; they also reveal shared female rage, vision, and pragmatic strategies for worldwide feminist solidarity and political transformation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each country's essay is preceded by a statistical preface containing carefully researched and referenced data on the status of women, including: population, birth rate, infant mortality, life expectancy, contraception and abortion (both laws and practices); percentage of women in education, government, and&nbsp;labor force; laws and practices regarding women's religious, secular, educational, and employment rights (including marriage, divorce, motherhood, custody, sexual preference, welfare, prostitution, rape, battery, sexual harrasment, and traditional/cultural practices); ""herstory""; ""mythography""; and more. Despite dramatic geopolitical changes&nbsp;since the book's first publication, much of the data on women remains virtually the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first such international collection, <i>Sisterhood Is Global</i> became an instant classic and remains unequalled in its breadth and comprehensiveness. The book covers Afghanistan to Zimbabwe (as well as the status of women in the United Nations itself), and includes moving essays from such distinguished writers as Marjorie Agosin (Chile), Ama Ata Aidoo (Ghana), Shulamit Aloni (Israel), Peggy Antrobus (Caribbean), Simone de Beauvoir (France), Lidia Falcon (Spain), Hema Goonatilake (Sri Lanka), Fatima Mernessi (Morocco), Nawal El Saadawi (Egypt), Ana Titkow (Poland), Marilyn Waring (New Zealand), and Xiao Lu (China).</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 2.56177148444 Pounds, Width: 1.6 Inches",29.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/03/9781558611603.jpg,Success,83,19.3

In 1989, she accepted&nbsp;the Order of Canada &#8220;on behalf of native people across the nation.&#8221; In this spirit she tells her story and, by her example, illustrates the experiences of an entire generation of aboriginal women in Canada.<br><br><br><br><i>Song of Rita Joe</i> is the story of Joe&#8217;s remarkable life&#58; her education in an Indian residential school, her turbulent marriage, and the daily struggles within her family and community. It is the story of how Joe&#8217;s battles with racism, sexism, poverty, and personal demons became the catalyst for her first poems and allowed her to reclaim her aboriginal heritage.

Joe is quite another memoirist altogether: poet, educator, and ambassador for Native people, she here recounts in both poetry and prose her struggles with racism, sexism, and poverty as well as her search for identity. Since the Native and non-Native worlds make such different demands, the quest for personal understanding is no easy one; addressing her non-Native audience, Joe says, ""It is hard for you to see our face, and sometimes it is hard for us to see ourselves."" In late life Joe finds solace in religion, but her continuing search for her true self still shows in the writing, which is quiet, almost dreamy on first reading, yet edgy beneath its surface calm.

0-19-510839-6,Revising Herself: Women's Identity from College to Midlife,"Josselson, Ruthellen",Oxford University Press,320,11/7/1996,,Hardcover,"<p>In 1972, Ruthellen Josselson was a young psychologist fascinated by the riddle of how a woman creates an identity and chooses one path over another in life—particularly in the face of the nascent feminist movement, which challenged as never before the traditional role models of earlier generations. Selecting at random thirty young women in their last year of college, Josselson undertook a ground-breaking study that would follow these women's personal odysseys over the next twenty-two years, from graduation to midlife. What she learned about the ways women reinvent themselves in an ever-changing world is the subject of <b>Revising Herself</b>, a myth-shattering look at both a unique generation of American women on the front lines of wrenching social change, and at the conflicts and compromises facing women today.<br>
 With stunning candor and hard-won insight, the ""ordinary"" (and anonymous) women in Josselson's study reveal how much more complex and interesting real women's lives are than the one-dimensional stereotypes often portrayed in the media. Dismissing a traditional ""stage theory"" of development as overly simplistic, Josselson identifies four trajectories that women take from adolescence to adulthood. <b>Guardians</b> are the ""good girls""—high achieving and committed to fulfilling their family's expectations, but rigid in outlook and resistant to change. <b>Pathmakers</b> are not afraid of risk or commitment, striving to balance their own needs with others'. The often idealistic <b>Searchers</b> are overwhelmed by choice and unable to make commitments, while <b>Drifters</b> live only for the moment, avoiding choice and an exploration of identity. Reflecting the degree to which women take risks, make choices, and form commitments, these paths form a foundation for adulthood—but they also lead to surprises: at midlife, Guardians seem strikingly able to ""cut loose"" from earlier traditional patterns, while many Drifters have ""found themselves,"" sometimes in quite traditional ways. And coming of age just as the feminist movement gathered momentum, the women in Josselson's study were the first to confront many contemporary issues not faced by their mothers, or their mothers' mothers: How does an Irish Catholic contemplate an abortion? How does a woman whose parents believe education is wasted on a daughter find the will to apply to medical school? In examining these questions and others, Josselson shows that the forging of a woman's identity—whatever her ""path""—is ongoing, a balancing of the need for self-assertion against the equally compelling need for relationships. Women create their identities along the seams of both competence and connection and continually revise what they have made.<br>
 Allowing women to define themselves in their own terms, <b>Revising Herself</b> holds up a provocative mirror in which readers can reflect upon their own life choices. Whether a Guardian, Pathmaker, Searcher, or Drifter, readers will recognize themselves in these women's experiences and gain new insight into how we construct our identities over a lifetime.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/92/9780195108392.jpg,Success,118,19.3

Yet as Leah Blatt Glasser shows, Freeman was one of the first American authors to write extensively about the relationships women form outside of marriage and motherhood, the role of work in women's lives, the complexity of women's sexuality, and the interior lives of women who rebel rather than conform to patriarchal strictures. In a Closet Hidden traces Freeman's evolution as a writer, showing how her own inner conflicts repeatedly found expression in her art. As Glasser demonstrates, Freeman's work examined the competing claims of creativity and convention, self-fulfillment and self-sacrifice, spinsterhood and marriage, lesbianism and heterosexuality.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.03 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/84/9781558490284.jpg,Success,121,19.3

She was ravaged by breast cancer and the debilitating side effects of the radical treatment that had been recommended to save her life. Yet in February 1995 she climbed to the summit of the highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere, leading sixteen other breast cancer survivors in a heroic demonstration of the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity. This thrilling, fast-paced survival story chronicles Evans's journey, from her diagnosis of cancer to the agony of treatment to her recovery and the birth of Expedition Inspiration. The culmination is the heroic ascent of 23,000-foot-high Mount Aconcagua in the Argentinean Andes. Expedition Inspiration is an organization devoted to engaging others to face the challenges in their lives and to climb their own personal mountains - one step at a time. Evans draws us into her story, describing in bold emotional detail both the exhilarating and heart-wrenching moments throughout her bout with cancer and while climbing remote and dangerous mountains. She copes with losing her hair, her strength, and nearly her life, but she rarely loses her lively sense of humor. She recalls breathtaking and enlightening expeditions to mountain peaks in Nepal, Africa, and Russia. Dedicated to helping others and to raising awareness and funds for the breast cancer cause, Evans will donate proceeds from this book to the Expedition Inspiration Fund for Breast Cancer Research.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",22,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/82/9780062586582.jpg,Success,127,19.3

Since Feminists See Their Work As Similarly Disruptive, Foucault And Feminism Would Seem To Find Much Common Ground, But, As The Contributors To This Collection Reveal, The Matter Is Not So Simple. Foucault, Like Many Feminists, Is Centrally Concerned With Questions Related To Sexuality And The Body. This Concern Has Led Both Foucault And Feminists To Challenge The Founding Concept Of The Modernist Philosophical Canon: The Disembodied Transcendental Subject. For Both Foucault And Feminists, This Subject Must Be Deconstructed And A New Concept Of Identity Articulated. The Exciting Possibilities Of A Foucauldian Approach To Issues Of The Subject And Identity, Especially As They Relate To Sex And The Body, Are Detailed In Several Of The Essays Collected Here. Despite The Possibilities, However, Foucault's Approach Has Raised Serious Questions About An Equally Crucial Area Of Feminist Thought - Politics. Some Feminist Critics Of Foucault Have Argued That His Deconstruction Of The Concept Woman Also Deconstructs The Possibility Of A Feminist Politics. Several Essays Explore The Implications Of This Deconstruction For Feminist Politics And Suggest That A Foucauldian Feminist Politics Is Not Viable. Overall, This Collection Illustrates The Range Of Interest Foucault's Thought Has Generated Among Feminist Thinkers And Both The Advantages And Liabilities Of His Approach For The Development Of Feminist Theory And Politics.

Undercurrents chronicles this transformation through Manning's startlingly funny, deeply affecting, and always honest journal entries. Outlining the depths and dimensions of severe clinical depression, Manning's quick wit and razor-sharp powers of observation allow us to laugh at and empathize with the mounting disarray in her life: insurmountable household clutter, nightly insomnia, manic, caffeine-fueled efforts to meet deadlines. We understand her terror as she evaluates a new patient only to realize that she herself meets all of the textbook criteria of depression, and feel her nowhere-to-turn despair as she is forced to acknowledge that the love of her family, the support of her therapist, and the exhaustive drug treatments administered by her psychiatrist are not succeeding in stemming the tide of her disease. Finally, Manning agrees to electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT. Notorious for its past abuses, its safety and efficacy open to debate, this controversial treatment becomes her last resort and only hope.</p> <h3>New York Times Book Review</h3> <p>A convincing testament to the inexorable cruelty of depression and a frightening reminder of its unprejudiced choice of victims.</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.36155810968 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches",8.79,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/43/9780062511843.jpg,Success,128,19.3

She draws on Hannah Arendt's work and ordinary language analysis to identify confusions in the way we think about public and private. She then uses the insights she has developed to illuminate issues in contemporary politics, such as the problem of transforming private identities into political ones in the ""outing"" of lesbians and gay men. Another such issue is the relevance of the private experience of nurturing small children to the political activity of the citizen.</p>
<p>Evenly divided between theoretical and issue-oriented discussion, this book makes clear the practical stakes in both the distinction and the connection between private and public. Boling considers how to translate private experience into public claims with regard to such contentious issues as shared parenting, abortion funding, fetal abuse, sodomy laws, and parental consent for minors seeking abortions. She also analyzes the application of privacy in landmark legal cases including Roe v. Wade, Bowers v. Hardwick, and Planned Parenthood v.

I watched you below dart out of the building and down the sidewalk, stop, turn, look up, and catch me watching you. Then embarrassed from being caught, I waved, casually, friendly, you know -- but instead of going on your way, you dashed right back into the building and called up the stairwell to me.

<p>""We're having one at my house.""

Duchess House being that collapsing country farmhouse I lived in with Dick and Diana, a young married couple -- too young and too married--and an assortment of other revolving students. The house was so named because our English teacher, Dick's and mine, said all great literature made use of religion, sex, or the aristocracy, hence the greatest sentence ever written would go something like: ""My God,"" said the duchess to the bishop, ""take your hand off my thigh.""

Mira Morgenstern finds in Rousseau an appreciation of the complexities and multidimensionality of life that allowed him to criticize various easy dualisms promoted by his fellow liberal thinkers and point to the crucial mediating role that women fulfill between the private and public spheres.</p><p>Morgenstern sees Rousseau as an important contributor to the feminist thoughts and concerns that animate so much of our public and private discourse today. While Rousseau is commonly seen as a patriarchal misogynist, Morgenstern finds evidence in his writing that belies much of this claim. Rousseau was very much a man of his time, but he also believed that women were the key to transmitting his ideals of personal and political authenticity, thereby transforming his theory from ephemeral ideas into practical reality.</p><p>A careful evaluation of Rousseau's writings on women reveals his highly complex sense of reality, especially his awareness that the solutions to life's complex problems are often temporary and must be renegotiated over time. Rousseau is more persistent than most in highlighting the weaknesses and pitfalls of liberal political thought, whose fundamental characteristic is its categorization of life on the basis of dualistic categories: public and private, outside and inside, male and female.</p><p>Ultimately, what makes Rousseau worth reading today, argues Morgenstern, is his ability to illuminate critical weaknesses in the dualisms of liberal political theory and his pointing out, if only by implication, alternative ways of reaching the full measure of our individual and communal humanity. In honoring the traditional liberal emphasis on individual liberty and self-development, Rousseauâs meditations on the proper aim of political life are especially helpful to those today who seek ways to expand liberalism's promise of freedom and authenticity, while not losing sight of the common threads of meaning and community that continue to bind us together.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.58071441854 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/36/9780271015736.jpg,Success,117,19.3

The Reader Soon Cares Deeply About Narrator Rachel, The Eldest Of Six Children, Who Yearns For Some Of The Forbidden Fruits Of The Secular World. Her Rebbe Father Is Another Endearing Character; He Dreams Of Establishing A Major Synagogue And Learning Center Even While He Desperately Looks For A 10th Man For A Minyan For His Sparse Congregation. Most Of The Story Takes Place In A Suburban Community That Receives An Influx Of Hasidim In The Summer Months; For The Rest Of The Year, The Rebbe's Family Is The Neighborhood Curiosity.

Her Seemingly Flagrant Behavior (she Refuses To Wear Seamed, Opaque Stockings, Opting Instead For Seamless, And Will Not Wear A Cover-up Over Her Bathing Suit While Teaching Young Girls To Swim) Brings Shame To Her Family And Endangers A Marital Opportunity For Her Brilliant Younger Brother. Despite Her Resolve To Establish A More Independent Life, Rachel Agrees To An Arranged Marriage, Both To Make Her Family Happy And As A First Step Toward A New Existence. When This Match Goes Awry, Rachel's Solution Is Both Funny And Bittersweet.

Cristina Mazzoni focuses on material from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mainly in Italy and France. Her approach uses the methodologies of cultural studies and feminism but also benefits from the insights of psychoanalytic criticism. She asks how the identification of mysticism with hysteria became prevalent, and explores the continuing dialogue between a historicizing view of hysteria and a view of hysteria as repressed religious mysticism.</p>
<p>According to Mazzoni, this dialogue is discernible at various levels and in a variety of discourses. The medical history of hysteria, she maintains, is often linked to the religious history of supernatural phenomena, and the medical discourse of positivism depends on the religious-feminine element that it attempts to repress. Similarly, she finds a continuity between the literature of naturalism and that of decadence in their representations of the interdependence of neurosis and religion. Finally, the religious writings of women mystics and the discourses they inspired reveal an unresolved tension between nature and supernature, body and soul (or psyche) which, Mazzoni suggests, mirrors and complicates the very issues raised by hysterical conversion.</p>
<p>Among those whose views she considers are the writers Jules and Edmond de Goncourt, Gabriele d'Annunzio, and Antonio Fogazzaro, as well as Graham Greene and Simone Weil; the mystics Angela of Foligno, Gemma Galgani, and Teresa of Avila; and the theorists Jean-Martin Charcot, Cesare Lombroso, Jacques Lacan, Simone de Beauvoir, Julia Kristeva, and Luce Irigaray.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.25883951602 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",47,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/93/9780801432293.jpg,Success,123,19.3

0-06-062865-0,Confessions: The Making of a Postdenominational Priest,"Fox, Matthew",HarperCollins,320,1996,,Hardcover,"Visionary, activist, and one of the most important religious thinkers and teachers of our time, Matthew Fox has devoted his career to unleashing the suppressed mystical and life-affirming traditions within Christianity. His theology of ""Creation Spirituality"" - notably the belief that we are born in ""original blessing"" - has reinvigorated the faith of countless Christians and earned him the headline-making censure of the Vatican, who officially ""silenced"" Fox in 1989 and precipitated his dismissal by the Dominican Order in 1993. In this always compelling memoir, Fox, now an Episcopal priest, traces the roots of his radical theology, from his 195Os childhood in Madison, Wisconsin, through formative years spent training in a late-sixties Paris rocked by revolutionary fervor, to taking on the Vatican (which he likens to standing in front of a train), to his most recent experiences as a leader of ""rave masses"" for urban young people. Written with his characteristic candor and insight, Confessions details Fox's spiritual, intellectual, political, and cultural evolution as an envelope-pushing member of a generation ""bold enough to question many things and to seek spirituality over religion."" Fox's story mirrors the questions and concerns of those millions of contemporary seekers with a ""passion for holiness""; a yearning for a Christian spirituality committed to social justice, feminism, and environmentalism; and a desire for ritual that heals, celebrates, and honors the gifts of being in each of us. Always relentlessly ahead of his time, Fox embraces his role as a ""post-denominational priest,"" passionately exploring the present and future role of faith, church, and a spirituality grounded in the emphatic belief that finding God is still possible.

                        <p>One of this century's most controversial and influential priests reflects on a lifetime of passionate faith in a book that's ""likely to become a classic"" (Publishers Weekly). ""This provocative work will surely add to an unbroken string of controversy surrounding Fox and his beliefs.""--Library Journal. 320 pp. Targeted ads. 20,000 print.

0-19-508967-7,The Faces of the Goddess,"Motz, Lotte",Oxford University Press,292,8/21/1997,,Hardcover,"<br>
The belief that the earliest humans worshipped a sovereign, nurturing, maternal earth goddess is a popular one. It has been taken up as fact by the media, who routinely depict modern goddess-worshippers as ""reviving"" the ancient religions of our ancestors. Feminist scholars contend that, in the primordial religions, the Great Mother was honored as the primary, creative force, giving birth to the world, granting fertility to both crops and humans, and ruling supreme over her family pantheon. The peaceful, matriarchal farming societies that worshipped her were eventually wiped out or subjugated by nomadic, patriarchal warrior tribes such as the early Hebrews, who brought their male God to overthrow the Great Mother: the first step in the creation and perpetuation of a brutal, male-dominated society and its attendant oppression and degradation of women.<br>
In <em>The Faces of the Goddess</em>, Lotte Motz sets out to test this hypothesis by examining the real female deities of early human cultures. She finds no trace of the Great Mother in their myths or in their worship. From the Eskimos of the arctic wasteland, whose harsh life even today most closely mirrors the earliest hunter gatherers, to the rich cultures of the sunny Fertile Crescent and the islands of Japan, Motz looks at a wide range of goddesses who are called Mother, or who give birth in their myths. She finds that these goddesses have varying origins as ancestor deities, animal protectors, and other divinities, rather than stemming from a common Mother Goddess archetype. For instance, Sedna, the powerful goddess whose chopped-off fingers became the seals and fish that were the Eskimos' chief source of food, had nothing to do with human fertility. Indeed, human motherhood was held in such low esteem that Eskimo women were forced to give birth completely alone, with no human companionship and no helpful deities of childbirth. Likewise, while various Mexican goddesses ruled over healing, women's crafts, motherhood and childbirth, and functioned as tribal protectors or divine ancestors, none of them either embodied the earth itself or granted fertility to the crops: for that the Mexicans looked to the male gods of maize and of rain. Nor were the rituals of these goddesses nurturing or peaceful. The goddess Cihuacoatl, who nurtured the creator god Quetzalcoatl and helped him create humanity, was worshipped with human sacrifices who were pushed into a fire, removed while still alive, and their hearts were cut out. And Motz closely examines the Anatolian goddess Cybele, the ""Magna Mater"" most often cited as an example of a powerful mother goddess. Hers were the last of the great pagan mysteries of the Mediterranean civilizations to fall before Christianity. But Cybele herself never gives birth, nor does she concern herself with aiding women in childbirth or childrearing. She is not herself a mother, and the male character figuring most prominently in her myths is Attis, her chaste companion. Tellingly, Cybele's priests dedicate themselves to her by castrating themselves, thus mimicking Attis's death--a very odd way to venerate a goddess of fertility.<br>
To depict these earlier goddesses as peaceful and nurturing mothers, as is often done, is to deny them their own complex and sophisticated nature as beings who were often violent and vengeful, delighting in sacrifice, or who reveled in their eroticism and were worshipped as harlots. The idea of a nurturing Mother Goddess is very powerful. In this challenging book, however, Motz shows that She is a product of our own age, not of earlier ones. By discarding this simplistic and worn-out paradigm, we can open the door to a new way of thinking about feminine spirituality and religious experience.",en,New Edition,"Height: 1.03 Inches, Length: 9.57 Inches, Weight: 1.26324876126 Pounds, Width: 6.53 Inches",55,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/77/9780195089677.jpg,Success,118,19.3

Acknowledging the presence of female voices, Robin Roberts looks here at the ways feminist political statements operate in music videos and, surprisingly, even in MTV's much criticized Beavis and Butt-Head.
<p>More women are now involved behind the scenes at the executive level in the video industry, and they have recognized the medium's feminist possibilities. Country music performers, for instance, draw on a tradition of sincerity and storytelling to recount women's issues. Rap artists use the self-promotion inherent in their rap vernacular in uplifting women's rights. Female performers expose flaws they perceive in feminine paradigms by deconstructing stereotypical gender roles and, without alienating viewers, use an inviting sense of humor to criticize portrayals of male dominance. With skillful performances and clever lyrics, these artists assert the right of women to be sexual and to express their sexuality.</p>
<p>Queen Latifah's ""Ladies First"", Salt 'n' Pepa's ""Shake Your Thang"", Martina McBride's ""Independence Day"", and Julie Brown's ""Home, coming Queen's Got a Gun"" are among the feminist videos Robin Roberts discusses in documenting how video has moved feminism to the forefront.</p>

First Ladies is a wonderfully generous look at the women who, often against their wishes, took on what Truman calls 'the world's second toughest job.' &quot;<br>&#151;The Christian Science Monitor Whether they envision their role as protector, partner, advisor, or scold, First Ladies find themselves in a job that is impossible to define, and just as difficult to perform. Now Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry Truman and an acclaimed novelist and biographer in her own right, explores the fascinating position of First Lady throughout history and up to the present day.<br>With her unique perspective as the daughter of a First Lady, Ms. Truman reveals the truth behind some of the most misunderstood and forgotten First Ladies of our history, as well as the most famous and beloved. In recounting the charm and courage of Dolley Madison, the brazen ambition of Florence Harding, the calm, good sense of Grace Coolidge, the genius of Eleanor Roosevelt, the mysterious femininity of Jackie Kennedy, and the fierce protectiveness of Nancy Reagan, among others, Margaret Truman has assembled an honest yet affectionate portrait of our nation's First Ladies&#151;one that freely acknowledges their virtues and their flaws.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Truman's look at the nation's first ladies features capsule accounts of a selective number of women who have shared the White House with their husbands. She includes the obvious subjects such as Martha Washington, Dolley Madison, Mary Todd Lincoln, Eleanor Roosevelt and all the modern presidents' wives, along with lesser-known first ladies as Julia Grant and Julia Tyler. Although Truman, a mystery writer (Murder in the White House) provides a brief background on the women she profiles, she focuses, naturally enough, on their White House years and the roles they played in their husbands' administrations. And Truman attributes to the first ladies plenty of influence over their mates, asserting on numerous occasions that they have played major parts in changing the course of history (e.g., how Dolley Madison's courage helped her husband, and the country, recover from the War of 1812). But her light approach makes it difficult to tell whether she seriously believes her assertion that Rachel Jackson and Lou Hoover died of broken hearts because of the negative publicity about themselves and their husbands.

According to Freud, perversions are the necessary obstacles in a heroic plot of normal heterosexual development; and homosexuality is the nineteenth century's classic case of perversion. Roof builds on Freud to illustrate that a structural understanding of narrative enforces a heterosexual paradigm, a sense of meaning that provides psychological stability for the reader. Looking at film, television, and lesbian novels, Roof explores how ideas of narrative and sexuality inform, determine, and reproduce one another. She identifies the paradigmatic lesbian story, its unvarying repetition, and how it might be recast. Understanding identification as a narrative practice, and narrative as typically heterosexual and reproductive, Roof shows how sexuality and narrative must be disentangled to alter oppressive social practices.<i>Come As You Are</i> marks a significant contribution to lesbian and gay studies, psychoanalytic theory, and feminism.<br>

She Finds That Certain Characteristics Such As Ideal, Beautiful, Decorative, And Pure Both Describe This Art And Define The Perceived Role Of Women In American Society At The Time. Van Hook First Places The American Artists In An International Context By Discussing The Works Of Their French Teachers, Including Jean-leon Gerome And Alexandre Cabanel. She Goes On To Explore Why They Soon Had To Distance Themselves From That Context, Primarily Because Their Art Was Perceived As Either Openly Sensual Or Too Obliquely Foreign By American Audiences. Van Hook Delineates The Modes Of Representation The American Painters Chose, Which Ranged From The More Traditional Allegorical Or Mythological Subjects To A Decorative Figure Painting Indebted To Whistler.

Rich In Detail And Imaginative Insight, Art And Affection Meticulously Documents How The Twin Desires To Write And To Be Loved Drove Woolf All Her Life. Drawing On A Wealth Of Original Documents, Many Unfamiliar And Heretofore Unpublished, Including The Surviving Letters Of Woolf's Parents And Grandmother, The Vast Collection Of Letters Written Among Bloomsbury Friends And Acquaintances, The Manuscripts Of Woolf's Writing, Her Suicide Notes, And Other Sources, Reid Allows Woolf And Her Intimates To Speak For Themselves. Her Findings Correct Many Misconceptions About Woolf's Upbringing And Her Most Significant Relationships. She Reveals, For Instance, That Recent Reports Of Sexual Abuse In Woolf's Childhood Have Been Exaggerated - That While The Writer Was Sexually Traumatized By Her Half-brothers And Emotionally Scarred By Her Father, She Was Most Deeply Wounded By The Neglect Of Her Mother (often Depicted As The Very Model Of Victorian Maternal Devotion) And By Her Love For And Rivalry With Her Sister, The Painter Vanessa Bell. Reid Describes The Competition Between The Sisters That Became For Virginia A Contest Between Their Arts, The Pen Versus The Brush. The Effects Of This Rivalry Were Not Uniformly Negative - Reid Shows That Virginia's Jealous Preoccupation With Modern Painting Sparked Her Own Aesthetic Vision And Experimentation With Written Forms - But The End Results Were Tragic. Virginia's Flirtation With Vanessa's Husband, Carefully Documented Here, So Alienated Her Sister That After 1910 Virginia Never Again Felt Secure Of Vanessa's Affection. Reid Presents Powerful Evidence That Fear Of Losing Both Vanessa's Love And Her Own Writing Gift Ultimately Triggered Woolf's Final Suicidal Depression. She Also Reevaluates Virginia's Marriage To The Writer And Publisher Leonard Woolf, And Finds That Leonard Was Surprisingly Supportive Of Virginia's Erotic Relationship With Vita Sackville-west And That His Constant Devotion Provided Virginia With The Secure Emotional Soil In Which Art And Affection Could Flourish And She Could Keep At Bay, Until Her Fifty-ninth Year, The Demons Of Manic-depression. Reid Shows How, Until The End, Virginia Woolf's Own Insatiable Desire To Write Something Before I Die Most Sustained Her. 1. A Most Precocious Little Girl, 1882-1895 -- 2.

She begins with Du Bois' construction of ""the Talented Tenth"" as an elite leadership of race managers and takes us through the lives and work of radical women in the anti-lynching crusades, the civil rights and black liberation movements, as well as explores the contemporary struggles among black elites in academe.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>James is an African American intellectual who has written on U.S. foreign policy and the politics of state violence (Resisting State Violence, LJ 9/1/96). Her latest book examines the historic role of intellectual leadership in the black community, with special reference to the work of W.E.B. Du Bois, Ella Baker, Angela Davis, Toni Morrison, and Cornell West. Her primary interest is in challenging the elitism and self-absorption of academic intellectuals and in recovering the work of ""nonelite"" community activists who have contributed to public life through their journalism, polemics, and public speaking. Despite her sharp critique of liberal academics, her conception of the relationship of black intellectuals to movements for social justice is ultimately hopeful, noting that black progressive intellectuals ""shape America's national discourse, even while agitating for inclusion within it.""

Now Judith Viorst, in a witty and beautifuUy illustrated book of poems, looks at what it's like to be (gulp) fifty.<P>Judith Viorst's poetry collections, which include <i>When Did I Stop Being Twenty..., It's Hard to Be Hip Over Thirty...,</i> and <i>How Did I Get to Be Forty...,</i> have articulated our growing pains from single life to midlife, and have continued to delight millions of readers worldwide. Writing with the warmth and authenticity that have become her trademarks, Viorst once again demonstrates her uncanny ability to transform our daily realities into poems that make us laugh with recognition. Whether her subject is the decline of the body (""It's hard to be devil-may-care/When there are pleats in your derri&#232;re"") or future aspirations (""Before I go, I'd like to have high cheekbones./I'd like to talk less like New Jersey, and more like Claire Bloom""), she always speaks directly to our condition. Her funny, compassionate poems shed a reassuring light on the fine art of aging, and will delight anyone who is now (or forever) fifty.<P><br></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In her seventh collection of verse homilies the prolific Viorst ( How Did I Get to Be Forty and Other Atrocities ) offers mild-mannered complaints about and righteous jubilation in honor of aging--specifically, turning 50. ``No, I'm not ashamed of my age,'' she declares, observing that maturity brings wisdom, though various vexations (``Face lift, or no face lift--that is the question'') follow close behind. Interspersed with her gripes is commonsensical advice: when youthful ``fantasies of magic and of mystery'' prove impractical, a spirit of compromise (the ``sweet pleasures of an ordinary life'') will come in handy. Though displaying her knack for penning advice columns in a conversational verse form, Viorst is not a poet, either major or minor: her lackadaisical, thudding rhymes and metrics owe more to the prosaic rhythms of coffee-break chitchat than to the sprightly, simple domestic music of traditional American-made doggerel.

Contrary to the widely held belief that the home symbolized a refuge and safe haven to Victorians, Adams reveals that middle-class houses were actually considered poisonous and dangerous and explores the involvement of physicians in exposing ""unhealthy"" architecture and designing improved domestic environments. She examines the contradictory roles of middle-class women as both regulators of healthy houses and sources of disease and danger within their own homes, particularly during childbirth. Architecture in the Family Way sheds light on an ambiguous period in the histories of architecture, medicine, and women, revealing it to be a time of turmoil, not of progress and reform as is often assumed.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",110,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/60/9780773513860.jpg,Success,56,19.3

<p>For every three climbers who attempt to reach the elusive summit of Mt. Everest, one dies trying. But in 1988 Stacy Allison became the first American woman ever to climb the world's highest peak, having triumphed over not just the mountain—a treacherous and overwhelmingly male domain—but over a devastating home life filled with domestic abuse. With each step, she got closer not just to the summit, but to throwing off the ropes that held her in a marriage dangerous to both her physical and mental well-being.</p>
<p>Allison's thrilling account of how she called upon the same strength and courage that took her to the top of the world to finally leave her abusive husband is a dramatic testimony to her never-say-die spirit. The power of her vision, and her quest to achieve her dreams and free herself from a life of despair, are an inspiration of the highest kind.</p>
<p>""Men climb mountains because they're there.' Allison...did it to see if she could measure up. And as she scales peak after peak...her self esteem soars. Braving the Himalayan death zone, the most violent blizzard in forty years, avalanches, white-outs, and being lost at 26,000 feet, Allison...conquers her own life as she conquers Everest.""—Jan Goodwin, author of <i>Caught in the Crossfire</i></p>


                        <p>The peak of Mount Everest is the only spot on Earth from which you can't climb any higher. Now the first American woman to reach the summit of Everest tells the story of her exceptional personal triumph--both on the mountain and off. A riveting and inspiring account. 25 photos.

0-8014-8388-3,Disorderly Women: Sexual Politics and Evangelicalism in Revolutionary New England,"Juster, Susan",Cornell University Press,240,10/24/1996,,Paperback,"<p>Throughout most of the eighteenth century and particularly during the religious revivals of the Great Awakening, evangelical women in colonial New England participated vigorously in major church decisions, from electing pastors to disciplining backsliding members. After the Revolutionary War, however, women were excluded from political life, not only in their churches but in the new republic as well. Reconstructing the history of this change, Susan Juster shows how a common view of masculinity and femininity shaped both radical religion and revolutionary politics in America. Juster compares contemporary accounts of Baptist women and men who voice their conversion experiences, theological opinions, and preoccupation with personal conflicts and pastoral controversies. At times, the ardent revivalist message of spiritual individualism appeared to sanction sexual anarchy. According to one contemporary, the revival attempted ""to make all things common, wives as well as goods."" The place of women at the center of evangelical life in the mid-eighteenth century, Juster finds, reflected the extent to which evangelical religion itself was perceived as ""feminine"" - emotional, sensual, and ultimately marginal.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Juster (history, Univ. of Michigan) examines the changing role of Baptist women in Colonial and Revolutionary New England. At first essentially equal to men in church governance and in the right to speak in church, women were gradually excluded from power in Baptist churches after the Revolution. As the Baptist church adopted a more patriarchal model of church organization, women were not only marginalized and silenced but associated because of gender with several serious sins, including sexual misconduct, lying, and slander. For an earlier, more general discussion of Baptists in New England, see William G. McLoughlin's New England Dissent 1630-1833: The Baptists and the Separation of Church and State (1971) and Soul Liberty: The Baptists' Struggle in New England, 1630-1833 (Univ.

She has been a legend ever since. In this engrossing book, Maria Dzielska searches behind the legend to bring us the real story of Hypatia's life and death, and new insight into her colorful world.<P>Historians and poets, Victorian novelists and contemporary feminists have seen Hypatia as a symbol&mdash;of the waning of classical culture and freedom of inquiry, of the rise of fanatical Christianity, or of sexual freedom. Dzielska shows us why versions of Hypatia's legend have served her champions' purposes, and how they have distorted the true story. She takes us back to the Alexandria of Hypatia's day, with its Library and Museion, pagan cults and the pontificate of Saint Cyril, thriving Jewish community and vibrant Greek culture, and circles of philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, and militant Christians. Drawing on the letters of Hypatia's most prominent pupil, Synesius of Cyrene, Dzielska constructs a compelling picture of the young philosopher's disciples and her teaching. Finally she plumbs her sources for the facts surrounding Hypatia's cruel death, clarifying what the murder tells us about the tensions of this tumultuous era.</p> <h3>J.J. MacIntosh<br> - ISIS</h3> <p><i>Hypatia of Alexandria</i> is a clearly written, tightly focused book&#133;In contrast to a number of earlier writers on Hypatia, Maria Dzielska is meticulous about disentangling fact from speculation; meticulous, too, about documenting her sources and leading her readers, via her footnotes, to a variety of interesting discussions about the various points at issue.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.41 Inches",28.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/60/9780674437760.jpg,Success,116,19.3

However, most studies have focused on suburban youth, ignoring a large segment of the population, the urban adolescent.</p><p><B>Urban Girls</B> tries to reverse this trend. The researchers included in this ambitious project realize there is more to adolescence than the suburban experience. The city has unique effects on the people who live there, and they on it. Drawing on experts from across the country, <B>Urban Girls</B> investigates what it is like to be young in an American city. This book also explores the minority experience in America. It is wonderful to see studies of Black and Latina youth that do not automatically label them as future convicts, drug dealers, or with other negative stereotypes.<BR>--<I>The American Reporter</I> <p>Traditional psychology textbooks have ignored the normative development of urban girls and the unique situations they face on a daily basis. Lumped together with their suburban, mostly white and middle class counterparts, their voices are frequently subsumed within the larger study of adolescent development. <B>Urban Girls</B> is the first book to directly focus on the development of urban poor and working class adolescent girls.</p><p>Including both quantitative and qualitative essays, and including contributions from psychologists, sociologists, and public health scholars, this volume explores the lives of a diverse group of girls from varying ethnic and class backgrounds. Topics covered include the identity development of Caribbean-American girls, the role of truth telling in the psychological development of African-American girls, relationships betweenmothers and daughters of different races and ethnicities, friendships, sexuality, health risks, career development, and other subjects of importance to human development. Filling a gap in the literature of human development, <B>Urban Girls</B> is sure to be of use to psychologists, sociologists, and social workers.<p><br></p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Contributors present a portrait of low-income, urban American adolescent girls based on fact rather than stereotype, aiming to fill the gap in research about adolescent girls. They explore girls' attitudes and alternatives in areas such as identity, family and peer relationships, sexuality, health, and career development, often allowing the girls to speak for themselves.

Much has been written about Opus Dei, which during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II has become the most powerful organization in the Roman Catholic Church. Described as a ""Holy Mafia"" by its critics, ""The Work,"" as it is known, has been charged with secrecy, elitism, reactionary politics, and questionable financial practices. But no one until now has described the inner workings of Opus Dei, from its goals and methods to the actual day-to-day activities of it members, with as much thoroughness and detail as Maria del Carmen Tapia. The author describes what she calls the making and unmaking of a fanatic. There is the devious recruitment, the forced estrangement from her family, the indoctrination, life in the ""Golden Cage"" of Opus Dei's governing center in Rome, her years as head of the women's section in Venezuela, her sudden recall to Rome, where for seven months she was held virtually prisoner, and finally the reprisals after she left the organization. In this strongest indictment of Opus Dei to date, Maria del Carmen Tapia reveals the dark side of ""The Work"": its duplicity, questionable recruitment practices, shocking disregard for human rights, and the unwholesome cult of its founder.",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/79/9780826409379.jpg,Success,129,19.3
