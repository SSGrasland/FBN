The Mass Market Edition of Donna Gillespies’s
The Light Bearer
A magnificent saga of ancient Rome and
her barbarian enemies beyond the Rhine
First century tribes of northern Europe fought to maintain
their primitive accord with earth, sky, wind and spirits as ruthless
Roman invaders plundered their lands, burned their villages and
kidnapped their young men for the imperial army.
When the Emperor Domitian crossed the Rhine in 83 AD with
four legions, the north’s hope resided in a woman.
Auriane, daughter of a powerful barbarian chieftain, was
chosen by the most revered tribal prophetess to be her successor.
But war and necessity impel the indomitable young woman onto
a different path: she must take the oath of a shield maiden, and
lead her barbarian army in a doomed struggle against the Empire. As the only world she’s known
collapses around her, Auriane is captured and taken to Rome..…and into a life of horror and
glory no seeress could have foreseen.
Critically acclaimed newcomer Donna Gillespie devoted eleven years to
writing and researching this monumental story. T/Øe Light Bearer was an

ARGARET ATWOOD”S works, especially 7%e Handmaid's Tale, are
widely taught not only in literature courses but also in economics, politi-
cal science, sociology, film, business, and other disciplines. Her writings span a
variety of genres and address such themes as identity, Canadian nationalism,
struggle for survival, sexual politics, and shamanism; this rich and varied range
has proved fertile ground for teachers and critics alike. Approaches to Teaching
Atwoods The Handmaid’s Tale and Oher Works is the first book to address the
teaching of this writer’s oeuvre exclusively. Twenty-four essays are presented
in four sections: “Backgrounds,” which offers biographical, feminist, literary-
historical, and other perspectives; “Classrooms,” which provides advice on
teaching Atwood’ texts in a variety of courses and institutions; “A Case Study,”
which focuses on using 7Że Handmaid's Tale in settings ranging from a literature
survey to a team-taught utopian-literature course; and “Pedagogical Chal-
lenges and Opportunities,” which suggests innovative ideas and strategies, such
as taking a feminist psychoanalytic approach to teaching Szrfacing and including
The Journals of Susanna Moodie in a course on life writing.
Sharon R. Wilson, professor of English and women’s studies at the Univer-
sity of Northern Colorado, is the author of Margaret Atwood’s Fairy-Tale Sexual
Politics (UP of Mississippi, 1993).
