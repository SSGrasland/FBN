Will motherhood make this young woman poorer? Will it make the United States poorer as a nation? That's what the voices raised against ""babies having babies"" would have us think, and what many Americans seem inclined to believe. This powerful book takes us behind the stereotypes, the inflamed rhetoric, and the flip media sound bites to show us the complex reality and troubling truths of teenage mothers in America today.<br>
</p>
<p>Would it surprise you to learn that Michelle is more likely to be white than African American? That she is most likely eighteen or nineteen—a legal adult? That teenage mothers are no more common today than in 1900? That two-thirds of them have been impregnated by men older than twenty? Kristin Luker, author of the acclaimed <i>Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood</i>, puts to rest once and for all some very popular misconceptions about unwed mothers from colonial times to the present. She traces the way popular attitudes came to demonize young mothers and examines the profound social and economic changes that have influenced debate on the issue, especially since the 1970s. In the early twentieth century, reformers focused people's attention on the social ills that led unmarried teenagers to become pregnant; today, society has come almost full circle, pinning social ills on sexually irresponsible teens.<br>
</p>
<p><i>Dubious Conceptions</i> introduces us to the young women who are the object of so much opprobrium. In these pages we hear teenage mothers fromacross the country talk about their lives, their trials, and their attempts to find meaning in motherhood. The book also gives a human face to those who criticize them, and shows us why public anger has settled on one of society's most vulnerable groups. Sensitive to the fears and confusion that fuel this anger, and to the troubled future that teenage mothers and their children face, Luker makes very clear what we as a nation risk by not recognizing teenage pregnancy for what it is: a symptom, not a cause, of poverty.<br>

Thirty years later, he begins to suspect that he was never meant to survive that accident, and that dark forces are working to rectify that mistake. <P> When Hilton&#39;s wife, the only elected African-American judge in Dade County, FL, begins to receive racist hate mail, he becomes obsessed with protecting his family. Soon, however, he begins to have horrible nightmares, more intense and disturbing than any he has ever experienced. Are the strange dreams trying to tell him something? His sense of reality begins to slip away as he battles both the psychotic threatening to destroy his family and the even more terrifying enemy stalking his sleep. Chilling and utterly convincing, <i>The Between</i> follows the struggles of a man desperately trying to hold on to the people and life he loves, but may have already lost. The compelling plot holds readers in suspense until the final, profound moment of resolution.</p><h3>darkecho.com - A Guran</h3><p>Ms. Due has written a haunting first novel that layers the world that is with worlds that might be. Elements of suspense, Ghanaian folk legend, ghost tales, and a family love story are braided into a suspenseful rope that pulls one readily along. <p> Deftly handling components of an all-too-true-to-life racist psycho, the protagonist's warning and mind-destroying vision-dreams, and a convincing set of characters, the author holds one's attention with a sure style and fast-moving plot. I read its 271 pages straight through in one sitting. <p> In <i>The Between</i>, the reader is clued in almost immediately that Hilton James' brushes with finality as a child were in no way final and that we are dealing with alternatives to the present reality that he must somehow accept in order to save his family. His struggle to understand what is happening to him and to protect his family are compelling.<p> The book's characterization of even minor characters is believeable. For those who would like instruction in how to portray a strong non central female character, the author's DeeDee James is a fine example. The two children in the story are a bit too good to be true, but they still manage to be more realistic than most novelized kids.<p> <i>The Between</i> frightens us because we believe, from the very beginning, that this can and/or did happen.

J.",Daw,460,1997,,Paperback,"<p>Six months have passed since the reappearance of the starship Phoenix - the same ship which brought humans to the world of alien atevi nearly two hundred years ago, leaving a small and vulnerable colony to struggle for survival in a hostile environment. During these six months, the alien atevi have striven to reconfigure their fledgling space program in a breakneck bid to take their place in the heavens alongside humans. But the return of the Phoenix has added a frighteningly powerful third party to an already volatile situation, polarizing political factions in both human and atevi societies, and making the possibility of all-out planetary war an even more likely threat. On the atevi mainland, human ambassador Bren Cameron, in a desperate attempt to maintain the peace, has risked alienation from his own people by communicating with the staff of the Phoenix as spokesman for the atevi, and has arranged for one human representative from the Phoenix to take up residence with him in his apartments, and for another to be stationed on Mosphiera, humanity's island enclave. Now, Bren has the difficult task of indoctrinating Jason Graham, a young man who has never before set foot on a planet, in the intricate, delicate, and potentially lethal maneuverings of the human-atevi interface. And this at a time when, thanks to the assassination of an atevi lord who had been one of Bren's primary adversaries, and the near-collision of Bren's personal plane with a jet manned by an unknown pilot, the relationship between atevi factions is becoming more strained by the minute.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The human-alien tensions that marked Foreigner (1994) and Invader (1995) peak in this sophisticated conclusion to the trilogy. The atevi and the humans co-inhabiting the planet Mospheira are near the brink of interspecies war. The major hope for peace is Bren Cameron, the paidhi, or sole translator-diplomat between the atevi and the humans, who tries to bridge the inscrutable and unpredictable alien society and the small and paranoid human colony nervously marooned on its world. Bren's complex job is further complicated by the unexpected disappearance of the starship that had established the human presence two centuries earlier. Cherryh works entirely through the paidhi's eyes as Bren struggles to untangle the intricate relationships, shifting associations and convoluted motives of atevi, colonists and spacers. As he does, he realizes, to his dismay, that as his linguistic competence grows his heart goes out less to his own species than to individual atevi, even though the aliens are incapable of affection. Through her hallmark ability to craft nonhuman languages as the basis for alluring alien psychologies, Cherryh superbly resolves this epic trilogy's multifaceted conflicts, dramatizing again the idea that people can't truly know their own language-nor others, nor themselves-until they master at least one other tongue (Apr.)</p>",en,F First Paperback Printing,Weight: 0.48060773116 Pounds,7.72,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/89/9780886777289.jpg,Success,60,19.5

Offering a feminist perspective on the status of animals, this unique volume argues persuasively that both the social construction and oppressions of women are inextricably connected to the ways in which we comprehend and abuse other species. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such a focus does not distract from the struggle for women’s rights, but rather contributes to it.<br>
This wide-ranging multidisciplinary anthology presents original material from scholars in a variety of fields, as well as a rare, early article by Virginia Woolf. Exploring the leading edge of the species/gender boundary, it addresses such issues as the relationship between abortion rights and animal rights, the connection between woman-battering and animal abuse, and the speciesist basis for much sexist language. Also considered are the ways in which animals have been regarded by science, literature, and the environmentalist movement. A striking meditation on women and wolves is presented, as is an examination of sexual harassment and the taxonomy of hunters and hunting. Finally, this compelling collection suggests that the subordination and degradation of women is a prototype for other forms of abuse, and that to deny this connection is to participate in the continued mistreatment of animals and women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 0.98 Inches",24.66,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/71/9780822316671.jpg,Success,90,19.5

Through innovative readings of the Bible, theology and philosophy, feminist and poststructuralist theory, fiction and poetry, Western history, and current politics, Keller shows how the myth of the apocalypse has shaped our basic habits of text, time, place, community, and gender. Apocalypse Now and Then reveals the apocalyptic links of movements and events as diverse as colonialism, urbanization, nineteenth-century American feminism, and the current environmental crisis. Throughout the book, Keller constructs an imaginative counter-apocalypse that neither abdicates the prophetic passion for justice nor surrenders to the doomsday dualisms of the apocalypse.",en,First Edition,"Height: 1.2 Inches, Length: 9.25 Inches, Weight: 2 Pounds, Width: 6.44 Inches",3.24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/89/9780807067789.jpg,Success,98,19.5

But their marriage remains unconsummated because of a horrible incident in Noon's past, so each seeks comfort elsewhere&#58; Noon in the warm acceptance of the neighborhood church; Herbie in the arms of Ethel, a jazz singer. Then one day an infant girl is left on their doorstep, and later Ethel blesses them with her five-year-old niece. Suddenly and unexpectedly a family, Herbie, Noon, and their two girls draw closer&#8212;until an outside threat reawakens a fire in Noon, causing her to rise up and fight to hold her family and her community together. <P>Diane McKinney-Whetstone's <i>Tumbling</i> is a poignant, exquisitely rendered story of the ties that bind us and the secrets that keep us apart.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Sunday morning in South Philly, according to McKinney-Whetstone, is ""like buttermilk,"" with ""a quiet smoothness to it."" The same can be said of this remarkable first novel. A gentle portrait of an African American community in South Philadelphia in the 1940s and '50s, the story probes beneath its residents' lives to tell a powerful tale of damage and healing. Noon is a Florida preacher's daughter too scarred from a secret childhood incident to let a man touch her; her husband, Herbie, is a redcap who met her when he was a hepcat jazz drummer touring with fiery singer Ethel. When newborn Fannie and, five years later, Ethel's five-year-old orphan niece, Liz, are abandoned on Noon and Herbie's doorstep, the embrace of community allows the creation of a family. Many women struggle in private against pain-especially Liz, who hides in the closet and eats plaster to deal with what she knows about Herbie and Ethel. Fannie's prescient visions and her wish to stave off the inevitable underscore an ambivalent view of the power of change. As the threat looms of a highway to be built through the church-centered neighborhood, individual characters find their fates, and the delicately passionate narrative coalesces around a soul-galvanizing metaphor of bricks and mortar and spirit.

0-8032-1474-X,Automatic Woman: The Representation of Woman in Surrealism,"Conley, Katharine",University of Nebraska Press,189,10/1/1996,"Literary Criticism, Feminist",Hardcover,"<p><br>Contemporary feminist critics have often described Surrealism as a misogynist movement. In Automatic Woman, Katharine Conley addresses this issue, confirming some feminist allegations while qualifying and overturning others. Through insightful&nbsp;analyses of works by a range of writers and artists, Conley develops a complex view of Surrealist portrayals of Woman. <P>Conley begins with a discussion of the composite image of Woman developed by such early male Surrealists as Andr&#233; Breton, Francis Picabia, and Paul Eluard. She labels that image &#8220;Automatic Woman&#8221;&#8212;a term that comprises views of Woman as provocative and revolutionary but also as a depersonalized object largely devoid of individuality and volition. This analysis largely confirms feminist critiques of Surrealism. The heart of the book, however, examines the writings of Leonora Carrington and Unica Z&#252;rn, two women in the Surrealist movement whose works, Conley argues, anticipate much contemporary feminist art and theory. In concluding, Conley shows how Breton&#8217;s own views on women evolved in the course of his long career, arriving at last at a position far more congenial to contemporary feminists.</P><P>Automatic Woman is distinguished by Katharine Conley&#8217;s judicious understanding of how women&#8212;and the image of Woman&#8212;figured in Surrealism. The book is an important contemporary account of a cultural movement that continues to fascinate, influence, and provoke us.</P></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.46827866492 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/43/9780803214743.jpg,Success,94,19.5

Critics and readers alike fell in love with Em Hansen, the engaging female protagonist who solves crimes while battling stereotypes in the rowdy and unruly male world of the oil patch. The oil field has always been a volatile place to risk making a living. But now, during one of the steepest downturns ever, hard lessons await geologist Em when she swaps her blue jeans for tweeds and heads for Blackfeet Oil's corporate headquarters in Denver. She's coming up in the world - all the way to the twelfth floor of the Cattlemen's Exchange Building, where everyone seems far more qualified than Em and where nothing seems to make sense. Why, for instance, does Em and not the knowledgeable and attractive Peter Tutaraitis get an assignment so important that it has corporate titans doing battle in the boardroom? And why, during Em's first day on the job, does a twenty-seven-year-old accountant named Gerald Luftweiller plunge from the building's sixteenth floor to his death? Was it a suicide, or was something more ominous behind his fateful plunge? When a temporary lull leaves her stocking her desk with paper clips and reading the company policy manual, Em has time to ponder her strangely unfriendly colleagues and the possible reasons for Luftweiller's demise. There's time, too, to reflect on the oil patch itself, the land of temptation, where power, money, and sweet-talking men can quickly lead a lonesome cowgirl astray, especially when old rivalries crop up in a new venue. Surrounded by people she can hardly trust, missing her boyfriend Frank, who is still in Wyoming, Em soon finds herself looking for a ruthless killer, not oil.

                        <p>Geologist/sleuth Em Hansen travels from the oil fields of Wyoming to the highstakes corporate boardrooms of Denver's cutthroat oil industry. Something strange--and possibly deadly--is going on in Blackfeet Oil's headquarters, and Em better get to the bottom of the mystery--before she gets greased.

From &quot;Hey Diddle, Diddle&quot; and &quot;Pat-a-Cake&quot; to &quot;Little Jack Horner&quot; and &quot;Pussycat, Pussycat,&quot; these are familiar verses that have been passed from parent to child for generations; these are the rhymes that are every child's birthright.<P>With watercolors by Rosemary Wells that may prove equally enduring, MY VERY FIRST MOTHER GOOSE captures the simple joy and the sly humor that are the essence of Mother Goose. Parents and children will find themselves exploring this volume together, savoring delightful details and funny surprises on every page. This is a book that promises hours of quiet smiles and merry grins for readers of all ages.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this exuberant anthology, Opie and Wells choose the best of Mother Goose's ageless work and polish it to a brilliant shine: more than 60 rhymes appear here in four chapters of large, toddler-friendly type. And for those who thought there were no new feathers to be plucked from this goose, Wells's rich watercolor interpretations, simultaneously classic and contemporary, are a revelation. Readers will probably agree with Opie's prefatory remark: I firmly believe that Rosemary Wells is Mother Goose's second cousin and has inherited the family point of view. Her cast of bushy bunnies (think Max and Ruby), classy cats and the occasional human interact with a combination of wit, charm and ingenuity: Humpty Dumpty, for example, is a soft-boiled egg, knocked accidentally-on-purpose to the floor by a boy bunny at the breakfast table. Also strikingand appropriate for the intended audienceare the numerous scenes of adults and children working and playing together. The cozy, well-appointed settings and loving gestures project a reassuring intimacy. Wells also makes full use of an extended trim size. She encircles rhymes with spots of art, as in the Hungarian-style cat violinists that surround the text of Hey diddle, diddle, or embellishes spreads with panels, identifying pig breeds in her depiction of Whose little pigs are these? and naming a few constellations alongside Star light, star bright. Each rhyme begins with a sprightly decorated initial: a golden pear hangs from the I in I had a little nut tree. Motifs recur subtly and purposefully, encouraging close inspection of the pages. A collaboration that both freshens and preserves the past, this volume deserves a prominent place not just in the nursery room but on the shelves of all who treasure illustrated books. Ages 2-up.

1-56023-079-7,Health Care for Lesbians and Gay Men: Confronting Homophobia and Heterosexism,"Peterson, K Jean",Routledge,138,9/6/1996,,Paperback,"<p>Health Care for Lesbians and Gay Men educates practitioners about the special needs of gay and lesbian patients and how to look critically at the impact of homophobia and heterosexism on the provision of care. It provides an overview of critical health care issues for lesbians and gay men and offers concrete suggestions to health practitioners and social workers on how to address these issues in order to guarantee the best care for their patients and clients.</p>
<p>Authors in Health Care for Lesbians and Gay Men give health care providers and mental health workers practical interventions; suggestions for advocacy, social change, grassroots efforts, and alternative programs; and lessons about how to use existing procedures to more effectively meet the unique health care needs of gays and lesbians. Practitioners also learn how to utilize legal action in securing and protecting patients’and clients’personal health care wishes. Chapters in this book cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>how homophobia and negative attitudes can directly compromise the care given to lesbians and gay men.</li>
<li>heterosexism and biases which exclude the partners of gay men and lesbians from participating in the care of their loved ones.</li>
<li>legal issues and the need for legal recognition of gay and lesbian relationships, both to enhance the provision of care and for financial access to health care presently available to only heterosexual, married couples.</li>
<li>legal protection and special legal documents that ensure that the wishes of gay men and lesbians are honored and the integrity of their relationships not violated.
<p>Health Care for Lesbians and Gay Men starts with special issues confronting adolescents and the special role health care providers can play in supporting the struggles of lesbian and gay adolescents. It then continues to look at these issues over the life cycle. Three themes emerge as authors try to explain problems and possible solutions for lesbians and gay men seeking health care: the pervasive homophobia and heterosexism found throughout the health care system and the impact these attitudes and beliefs have on the health care of lesbians and gay men; the need for education in professional programs on special health issues of gay men and lesbians; and the critical role that social workers can play in both educating others about the special needs of their gay and lesbian clients and in advocating for their clients in various health care settings.</p>
<p>Health Care for Lesbians and Gay Men is essential reading for social work and social service practitioners and students working in the health care field, advanced undergraduates and graduate students of social work, professionals and students of nursing and medicine, and others concerned with the quality and equality of health care services. It urges students and professionals to challenge and evaluate their own attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in order to ensure quality services to all clients and patients.</p>

'When I was a child, people sat around kitchen tables and told their stories. We don't do that so much anymore. Sitting around the table telling stories is not just a way of passing time. It is the way the wisdom gets passed along. The stuff that helps us to live a life worth remembering. Despite the awesome powers of technology many of us still do not live very well. We may need to listen to one another's stories again.' Loneliness is the hidden wound of our time, the price many have paid for embracing such frontier values as independence, self-reliance, and competence. Rachel Remen invites us to see below the surface and remember that we are connected and can become one another's healers. Dr. Remen's unique and intimate relationship with healing and the life force comes from her experience as a physician, a professor of medicine, a therapist, and a long-term survivor of chronic illness. Her stories, picked from the tree of life, are dedicated to the ordinary hero in all of us and stand witness to life's natural tendency to heal our wounds. In these remarkable parables, we discover that our goal in life might not be a precise destination, but the ability to travel together with humor and meaning, with purpose and quality companionship, with warmth and tenderness. ""Kitchen Table Wisdom"" shows us that a good story is like a compass for life's journey, and reminds us of the power and joy of being fully human.",en,Abridged,"Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.75 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/36/9781574530636.jpg,Success,53,19.5

In earlier books she drew upon Dickens, Cervantes, Rimbaud, and Pasolini. This time, Robert Louis Stevenson takes the hit. <i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i> represents Acker's spin on <i>Treasure Island</i>, although the familiar adventure is buried under an avalanche of dream sequences and erotic interludes. The plot revolves around a cast of interchangeable female characters, who dart from one location to the next. Early on, they traipse through an Egyptian whorehouse, which occasions one of Acker's goofy epigrams: Every whorehouse is childhood. Later, they inhabit a futuristic metropolis and a girls' boarding school. One woman has an abortion; another has a roll in the hay with Heathcliff, who wanders in from <i>Wuthering Heights</i> for a cameo appearance. Finally they reach Pirate Island itself, an icky little atoll where the air is so odiferous that the clams who were lying in the mud-water below, shell-open, and the fish whose mouths were gaping even though they were dead, could see a wall of smell. By this point my mouth was gaping, too: why would anybody bother with this pretentious (not to mention odiferous) twaddle? Acker's politics are as muddled as her prose. And despite her constant yakking about victimization, the only victim in <i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i> is poor, defenseless Stevenson--and, of course, the reader. -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,,,0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/44/9780802134844.jpg,Success,61,19.5

0-452-27341-2,The Other Side/El Otro Lado,"Alvarez, Julia",Plume,155,12/1/1996,,Paperback,"<p><i>The New York Times Book Review</i> has praised Alvarez's fiction as ""powerful...beautifully captures the threshold experience of the new immigrant where the past is not yet a memory and the future remains an anxious dream."" These same qualities characterize her poetry - from the ""Making Up the Past"" poems, which explore a life of exile as lived by a young girl, to ""The Joe Poems,"" a series of wonderfully sensual and funny love poems celebrating a middle-aged romance. The collection culminates in the twenty-one-part title poem about the poet's return to her native Dominican Republic and the internal conflict and ultimate affirmation that journey occasioned. Bold innovation and invention, the interplay of sound, sense, and the rhythm of two languages, all characterize Julia Alvarez's art in transforming precious memory into unforgettable poetry.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Widely known for her novels, How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents and In the Time of the Butterflies, Latina author Alvarez claims her authority as a poet with this collection. Tracing a lyrical journey through the landscape of immigrant life, these direct, reflective and often sensuous poems are grouped into five sections which, like the points of a star, indicate a circle. Alvarez begins with ``Bilingual Sestina,'' a meditation on leaving her native Dominican Republic for an alien land and strange language. She ends with the title poem ``The Other Side/El Otro Lado,'' a long, multipart narrative recounting her return to her homeland as a woman transformed-translated-by the years she has lived in America from native to guest. The speaker may claim ``There is nothing left to cry for,/ nothing left but the story/ of our family's grand adventure/ from one language to another,'' but this poetry resonates precisely because that story embodies larger questions about self-identity. A meticulous examination of self-evolution, Alvarez's assured collection reveals that change can take us across borders so slowly that only on reaching the other side can we see the distances we've come.

In 1993, this question became the center of a heated debate when President Clinton attempted to lift the long-standing ban on gays in the military. This debate persists because the compromise policy ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue,"" faces serious legal challenges, and is likely to go to the Supreme Court before the end of the decade. Just below the surface of this debate rages a more general argument about the status of gay people in America.</p>
<p>Both sides base their views on assumptions about the consequences of integration. Even defenders of the ban grudgingly acknowledge that homosexuals are fully capable of serving with distinction. Few question gay service members' abilities or patriotism; justifications for the ban are now predicated on heterosexuals' negative reactions.</p>
<p><i>Out in Force</i> refutes the notions that homosexuality is incompatible with military service and that gay personnel would undermine order and discipline. Leading social science scholars of sexual orientation and the military offer reasoned and comprehensive discussions about military organizations, human sexuality, and attitudes toward individuals and groups. They demonstrate forcefully that the debate is really about the military as an institution, and how that institution will adapt to larger social changes. The contributors show that the ban could be successfully eliminated, and set forth a program for implementation. In sorting opinion from fact, myth from reality, <i>Out in Force</i> stands as an invaluable guide for the military, lawmakers, and the courts as they continue to grapple with this question of institutional and societal change.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.0582188576 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/88/9780226400488.jpg,Success,94,19.5

In fact, the rate of substance addiction rises from one in ten in the general community to perhaps as many as one in three in the gay community. 
<p><i>Accepting Ourselves,</i> first published in 1989, was the first book to address the problems and needs of substance abusers in the homosexual community. Now, in this fully revised and expanded second edition which includes a workbook format, <i>Accepting Ourselves and Others</i> examines the issue of recovery as it affects the homosexual and bisexual communities of the nineties, as well as their friends, family, and therapists. The authors address the relationship between substance abuse and being a sexual minority both within and outside of traditional Twelve Step models. They also offer new research on the relationship of HIV and AIDS to substance abuse in the gay community, as well as the relationship to other issues such as anxiety, depression, sexual abuse, and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>A special section developed for therapists assists the professional in working with gay clients suffering from addictive/compulsive behavior by addressing the impact issues such as abstinence, relapse, homophobia, and the prevailing denial of the magnitude compulsive behaviors have on this community. The Kominars offer a road map to those in the gay community searching to understand themselves and their addictive/compulsive behavior, providing invaluable help in maintaining long-term recovery.</p>
<p>This book is the first full, in-depth exploration of recovery for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, and for counselors, therapists, clinicians, and clergy who work with them. <i>Accepting Ourselves and Others</i> is a dynamic, frank primer that gets right at the heart of issues that recovering gay, lesbian, and bisexual people face.</p>

A rebellious, hurt, and literally scarred teenager, she sets out to search for her birth family, her mother, and herself. Finding her way to the remote region where she was born, Angel reencounters the brittle cold world where her ancestors have withstood both the harsh dangers of nature and the incursion of hostile outsiders. Here she reunites with Agnes, her great-grandmother; Dora-Rouge, her great-great-grandmother; and Bush, the woman who adopted Angel's mother and raised Angel when she was a young girl. But before Angel can settle into her new home, this recently rejoined family of women sets off by canoe on a journey to their ancestral homeland in the far North, where a hydroelectric dam project is under way. There Angel finds herself caught in a conflict that threatens two indigenous tribes, their ties to the land, and Angel's very essence as she tries to resolve her inner turmoil over who she is and where she belongs. Robust and poetic, Solar Storms has the feel of a richly woven tapestry. Both as a story of love and family, and as a parable of the Native American quest to reclaim a lost way of life, the novel not only fulfills the enormous expectations raised by Linda Hogan's previous work, it surpasses it.

                        <p>A novel of sharp beauty and sudden illuminations, by an acclaimed Chickasaw poet and novelist, Solar Storms is the saga of five generations of Native American women and their struggle for their land and their way of life.

And with wit and verve she claims her own Korean identity, illuminating the intricate experiences of Asian-American women. Born in 1912 - ""the year of the rat"" - to aristocratic parents, Hongyong Baek came of age in a unified but socially repressive Korea, where she learned the roles that had been prescribed for her: obedient daughter, demure wife, efficient household manager. Ripped from her home first during the Japanese occupation and again during the bloody civil war that divided her country, Hongyong fought to save her family by drawing from her own talents and values. Over the years she provided for her husband and children by running a successful restaurant, building a profitable opium business, and eventually becoming adept at the healing art of Chiryo. When she was pressured to leave her country, she moved with her family to California, where she reestablished her Chiryo practice. Writing in her grandmother's voice, Helie Lee depicts the concerns and conflicts that shaped one family's search for home. Evocative and keenly felt, Still Life with Rice interprets issues that touch all of us: the complex nature of family relations, the impact of social upheaval on an individual, and the rapidly changing lives of women in this century.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Lee traveled from California to Korea to recapture the life of her grandmother. Hongyong Baek (b. 1912) grew up in northern Korea, the daughter of wealthy parents, and at 22 entered into an arranged marriage and began a life of servitude to her husband. Drawing on interviews with her grandmother and writing in her voice, Lee dramatically describes the aftermath of the Japanese occupation of Korea, which forced Baek, her husband (with whom she ultimately fell in love) and their children to flee to China in 1939, where they supported themselves by selling opium. After they returned to Korea, the 1950s' civil war caused them extreme hardship. Baek lost her husband to diphtheria and was separated from her son. She supported her other children by practicing the healing art of Chedo. Baek emigrated to the U.S. in 1972. A captivating memoir of a courageous survivor.

0-452-27679-9,Appetites: On the Search for True Nourishment,"Roth, Geneen",Plume,256,4/1/1997,,Paperback,"<p>Geneen Roth's When Food Is Love profoundly explored the relationship between eating and intimacy in women's lives. Her rejection of convention in dieting practices has motivated hundreds of thousands of women to think more deeply about, and alter their relationship to, eating and food. When Food Is Love became a bestseller - but in the wake of that success, Roth found herself in an unexpected position: she descended into a long illness, losing what she thought she could never live without - her health, her hair, and even her best friend. In Appetites: On the Search for True Nourishment, Geneen Roth explores, with great insight and clarity, the process of questioning what was at the core of her own life, her ultimate return to good health, and the new and unexpected ways she found to nourish herself and those she has loved and worked with. Over the course of this journey, Roth looked deeply into women's friendships and what happens when they change; the longing for success and affirmation for one's work; the conflicting emotions a woman can have when she considers whether or not to have a child; the longing for a safe place to live and build toward the future. She writes, ""Appetites is the story of friends and women with whom I've worked as they've questioned the meaning of success, thinness, friendship, and fulfillment ... Why, I asked myself, is an embarrassment of riches embarrassing? Why do most women feel they will lose friends as they lose weight? ... What feels good about feeling bad? And where do we turn for nourishment when it's not in the places we thought it would be?""</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>That some of us overeat in order to feed a spiritual rather than physical hunger isn't a new idea, but perhaps no one has chatted it up with as much panache as Roth (When Food Is Love). In her earnest new book, this popular workshop guru focuses on the ersatz bliss of overeating but also expands her vision to question ""the meaning of success, thinness, friendships, and fulfillment."" Drawing on much personal anecdote-her hair loss following illness; her ties to her best friend; her worries about another's health, etc.-she charms readers toward realizing that true happiness comes not from a sleek body, wealth or indeed any external attribute but from a sense of inner worth. There's nothing new in that idea either, but Roth presents it, as usual, in just the right mix of confession, sass and style.

She fell in love and married Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, better known as Commander Everardo, a Mayan Indian resistance leader. Soon after, he vanished in combat. This is the story of Harbury's search for Everardo, one that grew into an impassioned crusade to expose those responsible for the human rights abuses suffered upon the victims of Guatemala &#151; one woman's heroic stand against the Guatemalan oligarchy, the U.S. State Department, and the CIA. A headline-making story of love, war, and courage, this is the personal account of an American woman and her unrelenting fight to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of her husband, a Guatemalan guerrilla leader.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Harbury's impassioned letter to her dead husband, a Maya Indian Guatemalan guerrilla leader known as Everardo, recounts the story of their relationship, which unfolded in civil war-torn Guatemala. Harbury, a lawyer with a history of social activism, met Everardo in 1990, when his country was ruled by a right-wing military regime and most of the population lived in dire poverty. Despite the difference in their backgrounds and Everardo's certainty that he would be killed, they married. He disappeared in 1992, and Harbury details her fruitless efforts to get help from the Guatemalan or U.S. governments until she conducted hunger strikes in both countries that drew attention to her plight. She finally learned that Everardo was captured by the army, tortured and killed on the orders of a CIA informant. Harbury makes clear to the point of polemic her strong commitment to the Guatemalan rebel cause and her idealistic love of the Maya people.

Like the pair of huckstering ballerinas who sailed over the Buick, they vaulted over milk cans and barbed wire. The TV dancers had provided an irresistible contrast to the workaday world of their family's dairy farm in Polk County, Wisconsin. This and other fantasies shared by the twins enabled them to dance through a tense childhood and adolescence. Sara, the cautious, quietly observant twin, narrates this reminiscence of sisters whose dreams were intermittently encouraged or dashed by their ambitious, stout-hearted Norwegian-American mother and their alternately abusive and loving Danish-American father, who felt enslaved by his land and cattle. The twins' emotionally fragile older sister, mischievous younger brother, and sturdy baby sister each found ways to cope. This is a personal portrayal of parents, siblings, family, and neighbors who painted the rural landscape in somber tones of duty and self-sacrifice, yet touched it with hope and grace. From the vantage of middle-age, Sara recalls her early years with pride and humor as well as a deep sense of loss. She also explores the process through which the twins unraveled their symbiotic, almost merged, identity to become independent young women eager to investigate the wider world.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7936641432 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",15.15,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/58/9780873513258.jpg,Success,91,19.5

This revisionist history traces how, despite male resistance to women's progress, the entrance of women and of their concerns into the public sphere transformed both the political system and women themselves.<br><br>Andersen shows how women's participation was based on a conception of women's citizenship as indirect and disinterested. Gaining the right to vote, campaign, and run for office transformed women's citizenship; at the same time, women's independent partisan stance, their focus on social welfare concerns, and their use of new political techniques such as lobbying all helped to redefine politics.<br><br>This fresh, nuanced analysis of women voters, activists, candidates, and officeholders will interest scholars in political science and women's studies.<br><br>In this rich and engaging book, Kristi Anderson presents a convincing argument that woman suffrage deserves greater scrutiny as a social, cultural, and political force in the development of American electoral and party politics.&#8212;Jane Junn, <i>Political Science Quarterly</i><br><br>Anderson's innovation in this book is to change the dominant question asked about American women's suffrage. . . .

Woliver, <i>Journal of Politics</i></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Andersen (political science, Syracuse Univ.) brings together a wealth of material from an array of primary and secondary sources in this reevaluation of the impact of the Nineteenth Amendment. She demonstrates that observers who deemed woman suffrage a failure understood neither the way in which the appearance of a new constituency changed the political calculus of officeholders and candidates nor the shift in public understanding of campaigns and elections that followed. Mistakenly held responsible for the decline in voter turnout, woman suffrage contributed to the Progressive-era shift toward rationalizing politics and diminishing the influence of parties. Throughout the Twenties, women negotiated their new relationship with political institutes and began to reshape the boundaries of appropriate gender behavior. Their commitment to a women's agenda served as a model for the development of interest group politics that currently pervades political life.

Jan's baby, Simone, was the fifth generation of women in her family to be abandoned by their mothers. Determined to fight this &quot;undertow of conditioned exiting, an affliction of easy farewell,&quot; Jan reunited with her daughter, now renamed Rebecca, when Rebecca was eleven. They spent the next thirteen years trying to come to terms with each other and figure out what kind of roles they were to play in each others' lives.<P>For birthmothers, there are no simple equations of loss and gain. Each adoption is its own unique universe of complexities and ambiguities. But often the most personal is also the most universal, and there are truths to be found in every story. This beautifully rendered, intensely personal memoir gives essential shading to choices usually reduced to black and white. Waldron does not dispense advice; she probes the emotional fallout, on both sides of adoption, an area in which sedated platitudes have presided for far too long. &quot;</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Freelance writer Waldron's poignant memoir, rich in vivid portraits of her divorced parents and her Boston childhood, recounts that in 1969, as an unwed 17-year-old mother, she gave up her baby-to her art teacher and his wife. Later, still unmarried, she and her lover had two sons. Then Waldron relates her reunion with 11-year-old Rebecca (whom she named Simone at birth) and their visits, ``labor pains all over again''; not until her daughter's adulthood did the two reach a loving acceptance of each other. Waldron, whose own mother was raised by adoptive parents, argues that adoption stories are often biased against the birth mother. She provides insight into the problems involved for the ``children of trauma'' and their natural and adoptive parents. Author tour.

Bitel Systematically Recovers The Almost-lost Society That Women And Men Created Together In Ireland. Europe Between The Coming Of Christianity And The Year 1000 Has Been Portrayed As A World Where Women Were Either Subservient To Men Or In Rebellion Against Them. Bitel Argues, However, That The Women And Men Of Early Medieval Ireland Did Not Always Submit To Patriarchal Ideals Of Institutionalized Oppression. Bitel Analyzes The Social Roles, Both Restrictive And Empowering, Played By Women In Ireland Between About 700 And 1100. She Focuses First On Sex, Love, Marriage, And Motherhood. She Examines The Economic Strategies That Women Developed And The Social Networks They Built In The Face Of Men's Desire To Restrict Their Mobility. In The Process, She Explains The Often Conflicting Ideas About Women Expressed By The Writers Of Medieval Irish Texts - A Small Group Of Literate Men Vowed To A Religion That Has Always Been Ambivalent Toward The Female Sex - Which Derived From Both Christian And Secular Celtic Heritages. She Concludes By Examining The Violent And Powerful Images Of Women Common In The Medieval Literature Of Ireland, Asking Why Men's Texts Consistently Depicted Women Negatively When Men And Women Interacted In A Wide Variety Of Ways.

Yet, when it comes to her professional abilities, she's at the top of her form, as this deftly plotted and absorbing novel (her 13th appearance, after <i>L Is for Lawless</i>) proves. Bader Malek, a local industrial tycoon, has died, and his four sons now stand to inherit a substantial fortune. But one of them, Guy, has been missing since 1968. A drug addict, ne'er-do-well and all-around miscreant, Guy had been disinherited by his exasperated father shortly before he vanished. But that particular will has disappeared, and Kinsey has been hired by the family to find out if Guy is still alive and thus in line to collect his original portion of the estate. She quickly succeeds in locating him and brings back a sweet, guileless and totally reformed man. But is he? The three other brothersa truly devious, arrogant and greedy lotare deeply ambivalent about Guy's return. A murder in the family leaves the surviving Malek kin as prime suspects. This is a subtle and swiftly moving novel, pleasantly unpredictable, with an agreeable overlay of smoldering romance, as fellow PI and former lover Robert Dietz reenters Kinsey's life. Grafton's heroine -- more introspective, yet still feisty and surefooted -- leads this finely tuned and at times electrifying tale to a thoroughly satisfying conclusion.</p>",en,First Edition,Weight: 0.79 Pounds,36,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/74/9780805036374.jpg,Success,56,19.5

In Postindustrial America is the family merely a moral and sentimental “worthy cause?” Or is it in fact the focus of some of society’s most important work—the development of productive workers and citizens—and thus one of the primary engines of economic growth?In <i>The Feminine Economy and Economic Man</i>, Shirley Burggraf sets the record straight about the true value—and true cost—of the family’s work in nurturing and protecting society’s “human capital.” With startling insight she also shows why we must replace our “charity” attitude toward family with something more appropriate, the same model we use for encouraging other, important economic entities—the model of investment and incentives.Economists have always referred to an inevitable “next generation” of workers who will expand the GNP, pay off the national debt, and support the social security system. Yet until now economic thinkers, predominantly male, have never factored into their equations the investment in time, labor, and opportunity cost actually required to rear those children into productive maturity. It was as if the next generation arose magically on its own when, in fact, the economically important work of caretaking was being performed all the while by an invisible, unpaid labor force called women.But now, with expanded opportunities available, women no longer volunteer to nurture and educate the young, or to take care of the sick and dying, for submarket wages or for no wages at all. A huge transfer of labor has taken place from the Feminine Economy of caregiving into the market-driven world of Economic Man, but economists, persisting in their blind spot, have yet to recognize the full impact of the shift. Thirty years after this free or underpriced labor force began to disappear we see our social structure fraying at the seams, and we wonder why.The answer, clearly, is not to send women back home, nor is it for paternalistic government to try to displace the family entirely and take over every caretaking function. The answer is insightful public policy that insures that those who invest most in producing our economy’s human capital—the parents, the teachers, the caregivers—be rewarded with real economic incentives rather than lip service and platitudes.A parent’s dividend through social security, dramatic revision of our divorce laws, and a parent-driven approach to public education are just a few of the provocative ideas Shirley Burggraf offers for bringing the family back into the center of this vital economic function. Both in its analysis and in its recommendations, this is a book certain to spark heated debate.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/14/9780201479614.jpg,Success,96,19.5

In March 1944, Hedi’s family, along with three thousand other Jews from her village, are confined to a ghetto, awaiting shipment to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, amidst the horror, Hedi turns twenty, her sister, Livi, fifteen. As Hedi and Livi will later learn, their parents do not survive.
<p>In April 1945, the sisters are transported to Bergen-Belsen, two months before liberation. Upon liberation, Hedi renews her acquaintance with Michael, another survivor from Sighet. They move to Sweden, marry, and eventually have three sons. It is the loss of Michael, when Hedi is only forty, that prompts this memoir. “It took me forty years to realize that I am a witness and that it is my task to tell what I experienced.”</p>",en,REPRINT,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/37/9780803268937.jpg,Success,94,19.5
