SN Š WOMEN'S LIVES
A BRIDE’S PASSAGE
Susan Hathorn's Year Under Sail
Catherine Petroski
Based on the diary of a 19th-century Maine seafaring
woman, A Bride's Passage recreates the drama of daily
life in the age of sail. Susan Hathorn (1830-1907)
kept a detailed journal during her first year of
marriage, which she spent aboard the bark of her
merchant captain husband. Here, Catherine Petroski
frames excerpts from Susan's diary with colorful and
insightful commentary on maritime history and the
social mores and folkways of the era. Chronicling
Susan's journey from somewhat giddy and pretentious
bride to seasoned seawoman and new mother, Petroski
creates a captivating portrait of a spirited, intelligent,
and dryly witty New England woman.
