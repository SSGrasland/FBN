What Is The Relationship Between Looking And Embodiment In Art Made By Women? In A Series Of Original Readings Of The Work Of Artists From Kathe Kollwitz And Georgia O'keeffe To Helen Chadwick And Laura Godfrey-isaacs, Rosemary Betterton Explores How Women Artists Have Addressed The Changing Relationship Between Women, The Body And Its Representation In Art. In Detailed Critical Essays That Range From The Analysis Of Maternal Imagery In The Work Of German Artists At The Turn Of The Century To The Unrepresented Body In Contemporary Abstract Painting, Betterton Argues That Women's Art Practices Offer New Ways Of Engaging With Our Fascinations With And Fears About The Female Body. Reflecting The Shift Within Feminist Art Over The Last Decade, An Intimate Distance Sets The Reinscription Of The Body Within Women's Art Practice In The Context Of Current Debates On The Body, Including Reproductive Science, Maternal Subjectivity And The Concept Of 'body Horror' In Relation To Food, Ageing And Sex. Drawing On Recent Theories Of Embodiment Developed Within Feminist Philosophy And Psychoanalytic Theory, The Essays Reveal How The Permeable Boundaries Between Nature And Culture, The Female Body And Technology Are Being Crossed In The Work Of Women Artists. 1.

Ferrazzi's unique inquisitorial autobiography and the transcripts of her preceding testimony, expertly transcribed and eloquently translated into English, allow us to enter an unfamiliar sector of the past and hear 'another voice'&#8212;that of a humble Venetian woman who had extraordinary experiences and exhibited exceptional courage.<br><br>Born in 1609 into an artisan family, Cecilia Ferrazzi wanted to become a nun. When her parents' death in the plague of 1630 made it financially impossible for her to enter the convent, she refused to marry and as a single laywoman set out in pursuit of holiness. Eventually she improvised a vocation&#58; running houses of refuge for ""girls in danger,"" young women at risk of being lured into prostitution.<br><br>Ferrazzi's frequent visions persuaded her, as well as some clerics and acquaintances among the Venetian elite, that she was on the right track. The socially valuable service she was providing enhanced this impresssion. Not everyone, however, was convinced that she was a genuine favorite of God. In 1664 she was denounced to the Inquisition. <br><br>The Inquisition convicted Ferrazzi of the pretense of sanctity.

0-8014-8433-2,Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America (Cornell Paperbacks),"Brodie, Janet Farrell",Cornell University Press,392,4/17/1997,,Paperback,"<p>In pocket-sized, coded diaries, an upper-middle-class American woman named Mary Poor recorded with small ""x's"" the occasions of sexual intercourse with her husband Henry over a twenty-eight-year period. Janet Farrell Brodie introduces this engaging pair early in a book that is certain to be the definitive study of family limitation in nineteenth-century America. She makes adroit use of Mary's diaries and letters to lift a curtain on the intimate life of a Victorian couple attempting to control the size of their family. Were the Poors typical? Who used reproductive control in the years between 1830 and 1880? What methods did they use and how did they learn about them? By examining a wide array of sources, Brodie has determined hew Americans were able gradually to get birth control information and products that allowed them to choose among newer, safer, and more effective contraceptive and abortion methods. Brodie's findings in druggists' catalogs, patent records, advertisements, ""vice society"" documents, business manuscripts, and gynecological advice literature explain how information spread and often taboo matters were made commercial. She retraces the links among obscure individuals, from itinerant lecturers, to book publishers, to contraceptive goods manufacturers and explains the important contributions of two nascent networks - medical practitioners known as Thomsonians and water-curists, and iconoclastic freethinkers. Brodie takes her narrative to the backlash at the end of the century, when American ambivalence toward abortion and contraception led to federal and state legislative restrictions, the rise of special ""purity legions,"" the influence of powerful reformers such as Anthony Comstock, and the vehement opposition of medical professionals. ""Reproductive control became illegal not only because of the fanaticism of a few zealots,"" writes Brodie, ""but because of its troubling implications for a broad spectrum of women and men, many of whom wanted and p</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>``Sexual intercourse began,'' wrote Philip Larkin, ``in nineteen sixty-three.'' Larkin's hyperbole is here thoroughly confounded. Brodie (history, Claremont Graduate Sch.) examines the changes in attitudes, technology, and medical knowledge that led to a 49 percent decrease in the number of children born to white native-born women during the 19th century. She examines an impressive range of original sources, including advertisements, an amazing array of advice books and pamphlets, and a fascinating diary in which Mary Poor, a New England woman, maintained an encoded record of her sexual activity over 23 years of marriage. In addition to describing changes in contraceptive methods, the author intriguingly attempts to trace the diffusion of knowledge and attitudes concerning sexuality and gender relationships. A concluding chapter discusses the ``Comstock laws'' of the 1880s (effective in some areas until 1965), which discouraged and even criminalized birth control.

0-8078-4632-5,Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the University of North Carolina Press),"Kerber, Linda K.",The University of North Carolina Press,318,2/26/1997,,Paperback,"<p><i>Women of the Republic</i> views the American Revolution through women's eyes. Previous histories have rarely recognized that the battle for independence was also a woman's war. The ""women of the army"" toiled in army hospitals, kitchens, and laundries. Civilian women were spies, fund raisers, innkeepers, suppliers of food and clothing. Recruiters, whether patriot or tory, found men more willing to join the army when their wives and daughters could be counted on to keep the farms in operation and to resist enchroachment from squatters. ""I have Don as much to Carrey on the warr as maney that Sett Now at the healm of government,"" wrote one impoverished woman, and she was right.</p>
<p><i>Women of the Republic</i> is the result of a seven-year search for women's diaries, letters, and legal records. Achieving a remarkable comprehensiveness, it describes women's participation in the war, evaluates changes in their education in the late eighteenth century, describes the novels and histories women read and wrote, and analyzes their status in law and society. The rhetoric of the Revolution, full of insistence on rights and freedom in opposition to dictatorial masters, posed questions about the position of women in marriage as well as in the polity, but few of the implications of this rhetoric were recognized. How much liberty and equality for women? How much pursuit of happiness? How much justice?</p>
<p>When American political theory failed to define a program for the participation of women in the public arena, women themselves had to develop an ideology of female patriotism. They promoted the notion that women could guarantee the continuting health of the republic by nurturing public-spirited sons and husbands. This limited ideology of ""Republican Motherhood"" is a measure of the political and social conservatism of the Revolution. The subsequent history of women in America is the story of women's efforts to accomplish for themselves what the Revolution did not.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.04058187664 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",39.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/22/9780807846322.jpg,Success,122,19.6

No woman who has had cancer continues her life uncharged. In their determination to uncover the complexities and subtleties of cancer truths, the contributors adopt entirely other ways of understanding their experience. Debbie Dickinson imagines herself as music incarnate, as instruments and voices, different selves, combine and conflict. Jackie Stacey confronts the cancer narrative head on - likening it to Hollywood structures with heroes, villains and closures - and looks for a different way to convey her own story. Patricia Duncker examines the anger so often excised from the heroic stories, and unflinchingly looks at the reaction of others to her and her disease. Felly Nkweto Simmonds finds cancer tempering experience, bringing strength but also aloneness. Poet Marilyn Hacker uses a sonnet sequence to convey the emotions her 'Cancer Winter' aroused; Carole Colbour chronicles the painful dissolution and renewal of a marriage.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.64374980504 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/09/9780044409809.jpg,Success,130,19.6

But the disastrous earthquake of 1916 changes her plans, at least for the moment, and turns Fremont into a Red Cross nurse and amateur detective. In the aftermath of the quake, Fremont offers her services as a nurse, rents a room from a mysterious librarian, and winds up in the middle of a complex mystery involving a double murder, the theft of two invaluable samurai swords, and an illegal import-export business. Fortunately, the intrepid Fremont has the help of her faithful admirer Michael Archer, who not only helps her unravel the puzzling case but encourages her independent spirit and even--wonder of wonders--gives her a horseless carriage.

Liz Wilson investigates first-millennium Buddhist notions of spirituality. She argues that despite the marginal role women played in monastic life, they occupied a very conspicuous place in Buddhist hagiographic literature. In narratives used for the edification of Buddhist monks, women's bodies in decay (diseased, dying, and after death) served as a central object for meditation, inspiring spiritual growth through sexual abstention and repulsion in the immediate world.</p>
<p>Taking up a set of universal concerns connected with the representation of women, Wilson displays the pervasiveness of androcentrism in Buddhist literature and practice. She also makes persuasive use of recent historical work on the religious lives of women in medieval Christianity, finding common ground in the role of miraculous afflictions.</p>

Working Parts is an exceptional novel that taps the essence of friendship and the potential unleashed when we face our most intense fears.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The title of Bledsoe's first adult novel (following a story collection, Sweat, LJ 10/1/95, and a YA novel, The Big Bike Race, Holiday House, 1995) refers to a mechanic's ordered universe, a self-assured lesbian's sense of women's bodies, and reading, which, like cycling, opens up new worlds. Lori, a brash, likable bike mechanic who can't read, compares coming out as a new reader to coming out as a lesbian, with initial fear giving way to the exhilaration of discovering a community. With humor and sympathy, Bledsoe conveys how hostile the world of books and print looks to an illiterate person. It is not entirely credible that someone with as much self-knowledge as Lori is described as having would act as self-destructively as she does, but this minor quibble does not diminish the pleasure of reading Bledsoe's novel. In addition to its appeal as fiction, this book is important reading for anyone interested in adult literacy. Recommended for all collections.Ina Rimpau, Newark P.L.

0-19-505309-5,Holding My Own in No Man's Land: Women and Men and Film and Feminists,"Haskell, Molly",Oxford University Press,216,1/30/1997,,Hardcover,"<p>Molly Haskell, one of America's leading film critics, has been delighting readers for decades with her intelligence and insight. Her landmark book, <b>From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies</b>, praised for its ""wit and style"" and called ""a valuable contribution to film scholarship,"" is still considered among the most stimulating and important books on the subject of women and film. In <b>Holding My Own in No Man's Land</b>, a series of pieces written in the twenty years since the publication of <b>From Reverence to Rape</b>, Haskell once again explores the relationship between women and men, and between the movies and those who watch them.<br>
 Haskell remains a controversial figure in both feminist and film circles, accused of ""uncritically celebrating heterosexual romance""—a charge to which Haskell cheerfully pleads guilty. <b>Holding My Own In No Man's Land</b> challenges the conventional feminist wisdom that the classic films of the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties were made by a male-dominated industry which reduced women to objects of the ""male gaze."" Instead, she says that women were better served by the notoriously tyrannical studio system than they are in the ""newer, freer, hipper Hollywood of the present."" A fascinating interview with Doris Day points out that, despite her current image as a symbol of all that was repressive about the suburban Fifties, she played a series of roles as—and was herself—a successful career woman who worked because she enjoyed it. In another perceptive portrait, Haskell describes the mesmerizing power the sultry, self-parodying sex symbol Mae West had on screen, and the financial clout she had off screen. And she writes about Howard Hawks's screwball comedies, such as <b>His Girl Friday</b> and <b>Man's Favorite Sport</b> from the Thirties, where assertive women were equal to men, and more than held their own in the battle of the sexes.<br>
 <b>Holding My Own in No Man's Land</b> ranges from interviews with Hollywood legends such as Gloria Swanson and John Wayne, to celebrations of the comic verve of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, to ruminations on literary figures such as Truman Capote and his Holly Golightly, and Jane Austen's Emma. We learn that the cleaning woman of <b>The Carol Burnett Show</b> logo was a reminder of the days when Burnett and her grandmother, ""out of spoons and relief money,"" worked nights as cleaning women in the Warner executive offices. We see Meryl Streep ""hiding in the spotlight"" in a refreshingly skeptical analysis of Streep's determination to be an actress rather than a star. Finally, Haskell closes with a wickedly funny section on recent fashion and style, including pieces on ""Lipstick Envy"" and ""Nude With Attitude.""<br>
 Haskell describes <b>Holding My Own in No Man's Land</b> as ""a kind of continuing set of ruminations, encounters, insights, and images of people and characters who have had an influence on our lives."" With wit and style she illuminates the hopes and fears we project onto these larger-than-life figures— the grand dames, the stoic heroes, the dueling couples—and the lessons we learned from them about how to fall in love, how to act as adults, and how to live in this complex world.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/98/9780195053098.jpg,Success,116,19.6

0-8014-3345-2,The Mastery of Submission: Inventions of Masochism (Cornell Studies in the History of Psychiatry),"Noyes, John K.",Cornell University Press,288,6/26/1997,Sexual Alternatives,Hardcover,"<p>Just over a hundred years ago, the Viennese physician Richard von Krafft-Ebing coined the term masochism, after Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, who depicted pleasurable submission to cruelty in his novels. Noyes analyzes the social and political problems that inspired the concept, suggesting, for example, that the triumphant expansion of European colonialism was animated in part by an ambivalence in masculine sexuality. In a society of accelerating technological change and rampant social violence, the individual was believed to be rational and self-determined. Male masochistic behavior defied such a system of belief, placing women in dominance and using disciplinary technologies as instruments of sexual pleasure. The evolution of the concepts is documented by masochistic scenes in literature from John Cleland's Fanny Hill through Sacher-Masoch's Venus in Furs and Pauline Reage's Story of O. Analysis of Freud's vastly influential rereading of masochism precedes an exploration of the work of his successors, including Wilhem Reich, Theodor Reik, Helene Deutsch, and Karen Horney. According to Noyes, the thematics of feminine masochism emerged only gradually from an exclusively male concept.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>That individuals sometimes derive sexual pleasure from submission to cruel discipline is no longer a dark secret hidden in society's closet. As witnessed in many popular movies, sadomasochism has entered the mainstream. How it achieved this status and, more important, its origins are the focus of this scholarly work. Noyes (German and literary theory, Univ. of Cape Town, South Africa) claims that although literary references to the practice date back to the 16th century, it was largely an invention of the late 19th centuryan attempt to understand individuals for whom the economy of reward and punishment, on which society was thought to be based, broke down and failed. Noyes explores the work of Viennese physician Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who coined the term masochism, and he documents the evolution of the concept with scenes in literature from John Cleland's Fanny Hill to Pauline Reage's Story of O. This well-researched and penetrating study, geared to academics and the most informed lay readers, is recommended for academic libraries.David R.

Diverse peoples held together by respect for each other and the prospect of swift punishment if their laws were disobeyed. Fertile land that embraced a variety of climates and seasons. Angels to guard the mortals, and mystics to guard the forbidden knowledge. Jehovah to watch over them all... Generations later, the armed space cruiser Jehovah still looms over the planet Samaria, programmed to unleash its arsenal if peace is not sustained. But an age of corruption has come to the land, threatening that peace and placing the Samarians in grave danger. Their only hope lies in the crowning of a new Archangel. The oracles have chosen for this honor the angel named Gabriel, and further decreed that he must first wed a mortal woman named Rachel. It is his destiny and hers. And Gabriel is certain that she will greet the news of her betrothal with enthusiasm, and a devotion to duty equal to his own. Rachel, however, has other ideas...</p><h3>BookList</h3><p>Next in line to become archangel in the angel-led dominion of Samaria, Gabriel must lead the next chorale praising the god Jovah, which means he needs a wife--fast--to sing beside him. Guided by the local oracle and the light emanating from the Kiss of the Gods (a homing device in his wrist), he finds his Jovah-selected fiancee in a common Edori slave girl named Rachel. The marriage proves, however, anything but romantic. Far from rejoicing in the sudden freedom that her marriage brings, Rachel quickly becomes a thorn in Gabriel's side, using her newfound influence to help her downtrodden Edori brethren. Displaying sure command of characterization and vividly imagined settings, Shinn absorbs us in the story of how Rachel and Gabriel eventually unite in true love and respect. With place-names such as Gaza and Jordana, she tantalizingly hints at her Samaria's connection to an ancient Israeli past, and she tempers the angelic milieu with talk of her angels' technological heritage in an entertaining sf-fantasy blend that should please fans of both genres.</p>",en,Reissue,"Height: 6.7 Inches, Length: 4.24 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 1.02 Inches",8.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/24/9780441004324.jpg,Success,66,19.6

Until I Was Ten, She Writes, Three Things Were True. We Always Had A Car. We Always Had A Backyard. And We Lived With My Father. Hard Times Set In When Veronica's Father Quit His Job To Become A Full-time Nightclub Performer And Soon After Quit The Family, Too. The Job Of Raising Veronica And Her Little Brother, Malcolm X Chambers, Was Left Exclusively To Her Mother, A Panamanian Immigrant Whose Secretary's Salary Just Barely Met The Needs Of Her Family. From A Young Age, Veronica Understood That The Best She Could Do For Her Mother Was To Be A Perfect Child - To Rewrite Her Christmas Wish Lists To Her Mother's Budget, To Look After Her Difficult Brother, To Get By On Her Own. More Than A Family Memoir, Mama's Girl Gives Voice To The First Generation Of African-americans To Come Of Age In The Post-civil Rights Era.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>while Billed As A Memoir From The Post-civil Rights Generation, Chambers's Remarkable Story-told With Admirable If Sometimes Frustrating Control-is Very Much Her Own. If Anything, It Echoes The American Stories Of Early European Immigrants' Children, Though Here The Immigrants Are Blacks From The West Indies. Chambers Grew Up In Brooklyn In The 1970s, Her Mother Enduring, Her Father Violent And Philandering. The Marriage Broke Up. Cecilia Chambers Downplayed Her Daughter's Scholastic Achievements, More Worried About Her Struggling Son, And Never Discussed Sex.

Chambers Writes Of A Tender, Belated Rapprochement With Her Mother, And A Daughter's Gift-in Money And Support-that Allows Cecilia To Be Finally More Than Just Coping.

It shows women as active participants in artistic, social, and political movements and documents the wide range of their responses to the multifaceted urban culture of Berlin in the 1920s and 1930s. Examining a variety of media ranging from scientific writings to literature and the visual arts, the authors trace gered discourses as they developed to make sense of and regulate emerging new images of femininity. Besides treating classic films such as Metropolis and Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, the articles discuss other forms of mass culture, including the fashion industry and the revue performances of Josephine Baker. Their emphasis on women's critical involvement in the construction of their own modernity illustrates the significance of the Weimar cultural experience and its relevance to contemporary ger, German, film, and cultural studies.

In Postindustrial America is the family merely a moral and sentimental “worthy cause?” Or is it in fact the focus of some of society’s most important work—the development of productive workers and citizens—and thus one of the primary engines of economic growth?In <i>The Feminine Economy and Economic Man</i>, Shirley Burggraf sets the record straight about the true value—and true cost—of the family’s work in nurturing and protecting society’s “human capital.” With startling insight she also shows why we must replace our “charity” attitude toward family with something more appropriate, the same model we use for encouraging other, important economic entities—the model of investment and incentives.Economists have always referred to an inevitable “next generation” of workers who will expand the GNP, pay off the national debt, and support the social security system. Yet until now economic thinkers, predominantly male, have never factored into their equations the investment in time, labor, and opportunity cost actually required to rear those children into productive maturity. It was as if the next generation arose magically on its own when, in fact, the economically important work of caretaking was being performed all the while by an invisible, unpaid labor force called women.But now, with expanded opportunities available, women no longer volunteer to nurture and educate the young, or to take care of the sick and dying, for submarket wages or for no wages at all. A huge transfer of labor has taken place from the Feminine Economy of caregiving into the market-driven world of Economic Man, but economists, persisting in their blind spot, have yet to recognize the full impact of the shift. Thirty years after this free or underpriced labor force began to disappear we see our social structure fraying at the seams, and we wonder why.The answer, clearly, is not to send women back home, nor is it for paternalistic government to try to displace the family entirely and take over every caretaking function. The answer is insightful public policy that insures that those who invest most in producing our economy’s human capital—the parents, the teachers, the caregivers—be rewarded with real economic incentives rather than lip service and platitudes.A parent’s dividend through social security, dramatic revision of our divorce laws, and a parent-driven approach to public education are just a few of the provocative ideas Shirley Burggraf offers for bringing the family back into the center of this vital economic function. Both in its analysis and in its recommendations, this is a book certain to spark heated debate.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/14/9780201479614.jpg,Success,124,19.6

Dickerson Analyzes Women's Spirituality In A Materialistic Age By Examining The Supernatural Fiction Of Charlotte And Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, And George Eliot And Provides Interpretive Readings Of Familiar Texts Like Jane Eyre And Wuthering Heights. Other Works By Lesser-known Authors Are Also Examined. Technological Advances Eliminated Many Of The Jobs Women Were Accustomed To Doing. This Left Women Looking For Their Place In Society. A Sense Of In-betweenness Developed In These Women Who Were Now Expected To Attend Not Only To The Physical But Also To The Moral And Spiritual Needs Of The Family. As An Answer To This In-betweenness Some Channeled Their Power Toward The Art Of Writing. Because People In The Mid-1800s Were So Thoroughly Engaged In Scientific Thought And Advancements, Supernatural Folklore And Spirituality Were Disreputable Ideas For Anyone, Especially Women, To Explore. Ghosts And Spirits Were Tied To Old-wives' Tales, Superstitions, And Legends. However, By Focusing On These Concepts And Using Fiction As An Outlet, Women Were Able To Make Great Strides In Being Seen And Heard. The Art Of Writing Functioned As An Exploration Of Their Spiritualism In Which Women Discovered Expression, Freedom, And Power. This Perceptive, Well-written Book Will Add A New Dimension To Our Understanding Of Women's Supernatural Writings Of The Victorian Era.

<li>group therapy for older gay males</li>

Six methods are examined in twenty articles: roleplays, contrast-culture training, simulation games, critical incidents, the culture assimilator, and case studies. In each, a lead article traces the development and use of the particular method; several articles then offer specific applications. Intercultural Sourcebook provides both a framework for conceptualizing the training methods covered and guidelines for applying them in one's own work.Each article is written by an experienced trainer; in fact, the author list comprises a who's who in the field. Thorough, practical and enlightening, this book will define the field for years to come. The Intercultural Sourcebook was worth waiting for. The clarity of its presentation, the scope of its coverage, and its bringing together some of the most experienced in the field offers us the most complete and up-to-date resource for our intercultural work.

This biography tells of the obstacles she faced and how she overcame adversity to follow her dreams of flying.</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Fear was not an emotion known to Beryl Markham. Whether as a horse trainer or pilot, or just living among wild animals, she strove to succeed and never look back. Growing up in early twentieth-century British East Africa (now known as Kenya), she spent most of her childhood outdoors, barefoot, and in the company of her African servant and his son. Abandoned physically by her mother and emotionally by her father, a series of governesses, teachers, and housekeepers could not teach her any of the feminine skills of the time period. Adulthood brought a series of unsuccessful marriages, renown as a female pilot who dared fly solo from England to New York in 1936, and an eventual return to Kenya. Adventure figured strongly in whatever she did. There is little warmth in the retelling of her life story-which often includes quotes from her memoir West with the Night (North Point Press, 1985)-perhaps reflecting the loveless existence she led. The connectedness one might feel from reading a biographical portrait is missing here; events in Markham's life seem more strung together than a flowing story that draws the reader in. Index.

No one, after reading <i>Sex and Sensibility</i>, can think that sexual orientation is an obvious matter.""&#151;Nancy J. Chodorow, author of <i>Femininities, Masculinities, Sexualities&#58; Freud and Beyond</i><P>""Stein does an outstanding job of relating the development of a queer sensibility in the 1990s to the foundation created by gay rights and feminist movements a generation earlier.""&#151;Ellen Lewin, author of <i>Lesbian Mothers&#58; Accounts of Gender in American Culture</i><P>""At last a work that escapes the stultifying quagmire of the feminist 'sex wars' between social constructionism and essentialism. Arlene Stein is the Jane Austen of lesbian identity politics.""&#151;Judith Stacey, author of <i><br>In the Name of the Family</i></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>These two books are so similar as to be interchangeable; the only significant difference is that one study was done on the West Coast and the other on the East. Stein (sociology, Univ. of Oregon) interviewed 30 women in the San Francisco area, while Esterberg (sociology and director of women's studies, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City) interviewed 43 women in an unidentified Northeast community. Focusing on the integration of feminism, antiracism, and social justice with lesbian lives, both discussions are fascinating, and their portrayal of lesbian identity as changeable and fluid is valuable. Although the word bisexual does not appear in Stein's title, her focus on bisexual women is easily as strong as Esterberg's. And Stein's discussion of separatists may be patronizing when she suggests that ""separatism would give the lifelong lesbian some insurance that women she became involved with would not leave her for men."" Despite these minor flaws, these are both important contributions. Recommended for academic libraries, especially those supporting lesbian, gay, and bisexual studies.Pauline Klein, DeKalb Cty.

The showgirl lover of a dead New York mafioso is murdered in Las Vegas. Her last words are difficult to understand but included the name of Verico, which might refer to a bio-research company in New Jersey. An Ivy League scientist is found dead in a Boston parking lot after a job interview at Verico. And the Mafia has secretly invested in this firm doing cutting-edge work with recombinant DNA. Cavanaugh knows it's all tied together, but not how, and he doesn't have enough hard evidence to convince his boss there's a case anywhere. People keep dying, but nothing makes sense, and Cavanaugh gets more desperate to find the key.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a childhood in a wealthy but troubled family, Maimie's struggle for survival began at age 13 following years of apparent incestuous abuse. Her descent led her through reformatories, jails, and hospitals. It also brought her into contact with a sometimes colorful, sometimes grim assortment of people living on the edge, whose miseries and hopes she depicts with a true writer's gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the intervention of a devoted social worker and the support of Fanny Quincy Howe-and despite experiences of sexual harrasment-Maimie is able, during the course of her correspondence, to leave prostitution and learn secretarial skills. With these skills-and with her talent for management, her street wisdom, and her compassion-Maimie becomes a kind of self-invented social worker, eventually providing shelter and services to street women in Montreal. The final letters in 1922 find Maimie happily married, mother to two adopted children, intent upon publishing her writing-and as indefatigable as ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new afterword by Ruth Rosen follows the elusive vilifying portraits of prostitutes emanating from Hollywood, <i>The Maimie Papers</i> introduces an unforgettable woman with a powerful writer's voice, who captures the present with wit and candor, and recalls the past without sentiment.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.5763051733 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",18.77,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/36/9781558611436.jpg,Success,86,19.6

The setting of these sometimes wryly funny, sometimes heartbreaking stories, shifts from the war-torn, tradition-bound Malaysia of Lim's childhood to the liberating but confusing and often harsh United States of her childhood. Her memory is undiluted by nostalgia, her ear is perfectly tuned to the voices of both her old country and her new, and her eye is sharp to the special dilemmas faced by girls and women. Shirley Lim captures, as few writers have, the poignant and perplexing experience of immigrant women, who, torn between two cultures, must build their own values and their own homelands from within.</p> <br><br><P> <b>Two Dreams</b> draws together the best of Lim's short fiction from nearly three decades, most of it never before available in the United States, and includes important new work. In the new story Sisters, Su Swee Wing finds escape from her overbearing, traditional father by excelling in school and applying to college in the United States, while the older sister she adores-the fearless, wise-cracking, no-good Yen-is pushed into an arranged marriage. Hunger is the painfully vivid story of a girl, abandoned by her mother, who is literally starving for lack of attention and love, but hides her hunger from the world because she is ashamed. In the title story, a young woman emigre dreams through the cold New York winter of her hometown in Malaysia, of the warm salty sea of her childhood, like emryonic fluid...to which she returned in her sleep. But when she visits Malaysia, her dreams reveal that she is no longer at homein the land of her birth.</p> <br><br><P> Much of the drama of Lim's stories is played out in the in-between spaces where differences meet&#58; old values and new, Asia and America, parents and children, men and women. Thsi terrain is fraught with ambivalence and thus with danger-but also with possibility. Lim has explored this territory throughout her writing life; among her mementos are the haunting, corrageously original stories of <b>Two Dreams</b>. </p></p>",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.68563763482 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches",14.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/89/9781558611689.jpg,Success,86,19.6

If not in our lifetime, we say, then in our children’s.Think again.If the rate of change during the last twenty years holds, it would be 2270 before women and men were equally likely to be top managers of major corporations.In <i>The Futures of Women,</i> Pamela McCorduck and Nancy Ramsey explore four dramatically different alternatives for the coming years. Using a powerful new way of understanding trends—scenario planning—the authors paint these vivid landscapes: ”Backlash,” ”A Golden Age of Equality,” ”Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back,” and Separate—and Doing Fine, Thanks.” Each scenario has its own inner logic, firmly grounded in today’s events, today’s demographic and social trends, and in tomorrow’s technological promises, but each one derives from a different combination of the political, social, and economic conditions that could prevail over the next twenty years. The authors’ report from the recent UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing further supports their scenarios.The book began as a project for the Global Business Network, a unique consulting firm whose scenario planning methods have helped governments, policymakers, and business leaders create effective strategies for the future. Decisions take on new meaning when we can ”live” for awhile in the world that would result from a course of action we’re now considering.Imagine a world where as many women as men are elected to the U.S. Congress. Or, a world where fear for personal safety causes women to don the Muslim chador on Western streets. Or, imagine a national economic policy influenced by giant pension funds whose managers and clients are mainly women. Or, a world where exclusive resorts cater to the sexual needs of busy women executives.Are any of these worlds in our future? Any one of them could be. Only by understanding how we could move from here to there—how the choices we make today could actually play out—can we hope to influence which future comes to pass.The official future won’t happen, but one of these four scenarios could. The compelling stories of women living in these futures give women today the reasons and the inspiration to shape their own.</p>",en,Advance Copy,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches",14.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/72/9780446673372.jpg,Success,133,19.6

What else can a fortysomething nonpracticing lawyer expect when she moves back in with her mom? For Nina Fischman, things could be worse. At least Nina is out of L.A. and back in New York, where there's always something exciting to do - like go to the funeral of an ex-boyfriend in Park Slope. By the time Nina and her mother, Ida, get to the dead man's brownstone, the funeral has turned into the Roz Brillstein show. It's hard to believe that Roz, flamboyant, artsy, and sexually accomplished, was ever married to stolid Andy Campbell, a hardworking research scientist who died by ingesting poison. Andy had been doing experiments on guinea pigs - in search of a herpes vaccine - when he was murdered. Roz, whose history of extramarital activities soon has Nina in awe, is hardly grieving-widow material. But who killed Andy? Nina and Mama Ida collect suspects the way some women pick out shoes - after all, suspicion is a natural Fischman gift. But quickly their uninvited investigation leads them to an animal rights organization called SPASM, headed by a man of unbearably good looks, and an odd real estate deal between Andy Campbell and Nina's brother-in-law, the dermatologist. With a running dialogue between Nina, her newly liberated sister, and her ever-resourceful mother, the Fischman women are soon hot on the killer's trail.

<p>Skandranon Rashkae is perhaps the finest specimen of his race, with gleaming ebony feathers, majestic wingspan, keen magesight and sharp intelligence. Courageous, bold, and crafty, Skan is everything a gryphon should be. He is the fulfillment of everything that the Mage of Silence, the human sorcerer called Urtho, intended to achieve when he created these magical beings to be his champions, the defenders of his realm—a verdant plain long coveted by the evil mage Maar.</p>
<p> Now Maar is once again advancing on Urtho's Keep, this time with a huge force spearheaded by magical constructs of his own—cruel birds of prey ready to perform any evil their creator may demand of them. And when one of Urtho's Seers wakes from a horrifying vision in which she sees a devastating magical weapon being placed in the hands of Maar's common soldiers, Skandrannon is sent to spy across enemy lines, cloaked in the protective of Urtho's powerful Spell of Silence.</p>

Dr. Myss's system of energy medicine will teach you the specific emotional, psychological, and physical factors that lie at the root of illness. For example, fears regarding financial matters affect the health of the lower back; emotional barriers to experiencing love undermine the health of the heart; a strong need to control others or your environment influences the health of the sexual areas of the body. Anatomy of the Spirit also presents Dr. Myss's long-awaited model of the body's seven centers of spiritual and physical power, in which she synthesizes the ancient wisdom of three spiritual traditions - the Hindu chakras, the Christian sacraments, and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life. With this model, Dr. Myss shows how you can develop your own latent powers of intuition as you simultaneously develop your personal power and spiritual maturity. As you begin to understand the anatomy of your spirit, you will discover the spiritual causes of illness, as well as how to sense and correct an energy imbalance before it expresses itself as physical illness, and how to recover emotionally and physically from an illness you may already have. By learning to see your body and spirit in a new way that draws on old truths, you can begin to develop a spiritual maturity and authority that will change your life.",en,,"Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.75 Inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/79/9781564554079.jpg,Success,78,19.6

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions.</p>
<p>The term utopia implies both ""good place"" and ""nowhere."" Since Sir Thomas More wrote Utopia in 1516, debates about utopian models of society have sought to understand the implications of these somewhat contradictory definitions. In Notes on Nowhere, author Jennifer Burwell uses a cross section of contemporary feminist science fiction to examine the political and literary meaning of utopian writing and utopian thought.</p>
<p>Burwell provides close readings of the science fiction novels of five feminist writers-Marge Piercy, Sally Gearhart, Joanna Russ, Octavia Butler, and Monique Wittig-and poses questions central to utopian writing: Do these texts promote a tradition in which narratives of the ideal society have been used to hide rather than reveal violence, oppression, and social divisions? Can a feminist critical utopia offer a departure from this tradition by using utopian narratives to expose contradiction and struggle as central aspects of the utopian impulse? What implications do these questions have for those who wish to retain the utopian impulse for emancipatory political uses?</p>
<p>As one way of answering these questions, Burwell compares two ""figures"" that inform utopian writing and social theory. The first is the traditional abstract ""revolutionary"" subject who contradicts existing conditions and who points us to the ideal body politic. The second, ""resistant,"" subject is partial, concrete, and produced by conditionsrather than operating outside of them. In analyzing contemporary changes in the subject's relationship to social space, Burwell draws from and revises ""standpoint approaches"" that tie visions of social transformation to a group's position within existing conditions.</p>
<p>By exploring the dilemmas, antagonisms, and resolutions within the critical literary feminist utopia, Burwell creates connections to a similar set of problems and resolutions characterizing ""nonliterary"" discourses of social transformation such as feminism, gay and lesbian studies, and Marxism. Notes on Nowhere makes an original, significant, and persuasive contribution to our understanding of the political and literary dimensions of the utopian impulse in literature and social theory.</p>

The women who tell their stories in <b>Written By Herself, Vol. II</b> represent three generations, four continents, and a range of experience that is equaled only by the diversity with which they transform life into literature.<br><br>Here are England's Vera Brittain, commemorating the deaths of the men she loved in the carnage of World War I; Emma Mashinini, who endured imprisonment and torture as a labor organizer in South Africa; Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the daughter of Indian aristocracy who became an architect of her country's independence; and Edith Mirante, the wisecracking American whose passion for justice took her to the opium trails of Burma. Collected in this stirring volume, their voices demonstrate the ways in which women strive for power, inclusion, and autonomy&#151; and never fail to move, inspire, and instruct us. <br><br>Contributors include&#58; Margery Perham,Isak Dinesen,Shudha Mazumdar,Vivian Gornick, Vera Brittain, Elspeth Huxley, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Gloria Wade-Gayles, Angelica Garnett, Emma Mashinini, Meena Alexander, Edith Mirante, Mary Benson, and Ruth First.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In contrast to the first volume of Written by Herself (LJ 12/92), which showcased the singular achievements of American trailblazers in a variety of fields, this second volume of women's memoirs is concerned with the ways that women have engaged the forces of social and political change around the world. Conway (True North, Knopf, 1994) has selected the autobiographical excerpts with an eye for expedient storytelling rather than comely prose, and her editing is merciless. Her choices of British, African, and Indian women are strongest, including Vera Brittain's moving account of the devastation of her generation in World War I; Elspeth Huxley's portrait of a changing African through a child's eyes; the activist Ruth First's powerful South African prison narrative; and Meena Alexander's exquisite ""broken geography"" of her cosmopolitan memory. The ""postcolonial"" American selections (by Vivian Gornick, Gloria Wade-Gayles, and Edith T. Mirante) are more uneven.

Acknowledging the presence of female voices, Robin Roberts looks here at the ways feminist political statements operate in music videos and, surprisingly, even in MTV's much criticized Beavis and Butt-Head.
<p>More women are now involved behind the scenes at the executive level in the video industry, and they have recognized the medium's feminist possibilities. Country music performers, for instance, draw on a tradition of sincerity and storytelling to recount women's issues. Rap artists use the self-promotion inherent in their rap vernacular in uplifting women's rights. Female performers expose flaws they perceive in feminine paradigms by deconstructing stereotypical gender roles and, without alienating viewers, use an inviting sense of humor to criticize portrayals of male dominance. With skillful performances and clever lyrics, these artists assert the right of women to be sexual and to express their sexuality.</p>
<p>Queen Latifah's ""Ladies First"", Salt 'n' Pepa's ""Shake Your Thang"", Martina McBride's ""Independence Day"", and Julie Brown's ""Home, coming Queen's Got a Gun"" are among the feminist videos Robin Roberts discusses in documenting how video has moved feminism to the forefront.</p>

Moving relentlessly from one woman to another until faces and bodies blur, scamming her existence, learning what the street has to teach: how to make a buck, how to make it with a woman, how to court the dangers of crystal meth, how to survive.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Readers may recognize the start of Hucklenbroich's fine autobiographical first novel as Salisbury Joe, the evocative childhood story of a neighbor who comes back from the army as a he/she, which originally appeared in the anthology Women on Women 3. But the innocence of those early experiences disappears fast, leaving a slightly older Nicky learning the ropes of being a butch and living off the streets of St. Louis. In chapters that read like short stories, Nicky travels from city to city and woman to woman, from 1957 to the early 1970s. Nicky's butch existence revolves around finding places to stay, girlfriends to con and ways to make a living without working that will support her methamphetamine habit. Hucklenbroich's prose is vivid and detailed, but it is more hard-edged than nostalgic. Bits and pieces of Nicky's personality are revealed carefully, missing chunks often left out and saved for revelations in later chapters. The overall sense of time and place is skillfully communicated, the trials of homophobiaoften violentwoven into a myriad of other ups and downs of daily life. The epilogue, which seems to exist so the reader gets the point that living as a butch was hard, is merely didactic. Hucklenbroich's debut will no doubt be compared to Leslie Feinberg's acclaimed Stone Butch Blues, as both novels deal with similar protagonists and histories. But while Crystal Diary may not be as dramatic or emotionally charged as Feinberg's novel, it is an equally well-rendered account of a difficult lesbian history.

She often writes for and about young adults, but here her characters are mostly older and concerned about their marriages and careers. Their lives are marked by a tension between getting out of the barrio—earning college degrees, achieving some measure of professional success—and going back, whether that means visiting the now-desolate old neighborhood or having a Puerto Rican honeymoon. Another common thread is Mohr's feminism and the despicable macho posturing of many of the men. And in one story about a woman guided by voices she thinks she hears in church, Mohr explores the strong mix of religion and superstition that imbues Nyorican culture.

Instead, it proves the plurality of this natural attribute, or biological drive. Within these pages, prominent psychologists, sociologists, and sexologists explore topics as diverse as sadomasochism in the therapy room, sexual exploitation in cults, and genderbending in cyberspace. Other chapters are firsthand accounts of personal struggles and triumphs and deal with issues such as coming out in a Christian fundamentalist community, breast cancer and self-image after surgery, and being HIV-positive when your partner is not. You’ll leave this book with a heightened awareness of the full range of sexual experiences, sexual longings, sexual preferences, and sexual identities characterizing women’s lives.
<p>This volume makes clear in no uncertain terms that sexuality can no longer be swept into a single category. In a combined effort, the authors of Sexualities undermine patriarchal society’s inscribed gender roles and stereotypes and the restrictions and inhibitions the two cause. From the insight and expertise of the authors, you will acquire diverse and practical approaches to the subject(s) of sex that can be applied to the latest sexuality theories in your work. Among the exciting topics you will encounter in this groundbreaking book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>safer sex education for lesbians and bisexuals</li>
<li>parallels between migration, coming out, and psychological transformations</li>
<li>therapy as prostitution</li>
<li>the power dimension of sexual attraction</li>
<li>the lesbian sex therapist as object</li>
<li>the intersection of sex and religion in African-American communities</li>
<li>erotic themes in the mother-daughter relationship</li>
<li>cross-cultural aspects of sexuality 
<p>In a language that is accessible, frank, and often amusing, contributors from a multitude of backgrounds describe the ways they think about and apply the multiple meanings of sex to their lives and work. Psychotherapists; academics in women’s studies, gay and lesbian studies, and sexology; and lesbian and feminist professionals interested in current theories of sexuality will be inspired to examine their own notions of sexuality and recognize the diversity of women’s sexual goals and problems. This will help you in your day-to-day work, particularly as you address the needs and problems of women whose sexualities are different from your own.</p>

The Supreme Court Has Articulated Numerous Interests Promoted By Marriage, All Of Which Apply To Same-sex As Well As Opposite-sex Couples. According To Strasser, The Argument Made Most Frequently To Deny Recognition To Same-sex Unions - That Marriage Exists To Provide A Setting For The Production And Raising Of Children - Is In Fact A Reason To Acknowledge Such Unions. The Claim That Marriage Is For Children Biologically Related To Both Parents Is Refuted In The Case Law, Which Treats Biological And Adopted Children As Legally Indistinguishable. Strasser Explains Baehr V. Lewin, The Precedent-setting Case In Hawaii, And Addresses The Implications Of State-by-state Decisions To Ban Or Recognize Same-sex Unions. He Analyzes What It Would Mean To Say That A Policy Violates The Equal Protection Or Due Process Clauses Of The Constitution, And Compares Biased Policies That Target Gays And Lesbians With Those That Victimize Racial Minorities. Strasser Argues That The Defense Of Marriage Act (doma) Is Both Unconstitutional And A Public Policy Disaster. Arguably, It Does Not Give States Additional Rights With Respect To Which Marriages They Need Not Recognize, But Only With Respect To Which Divorces They Need Not Recognize. For Example, Doma Seems To Allow An Individual To Avoid A Court-imposed Duty To Support An Ex-spouse Simply By Changing His Or Her Domicile. Moreover, Strasser Argues, Doma Is An Open Invitation For States To Demand Exceptions That Will Wreak Havoc In Domestic Relations Law. In A Reasoned Response To Conservative Arguments About Marriage, Legally Wed Explicates Established And Evolving Legal Principles, And Shows How Invidiously These Have Been Applied To The Issues Of Gay Rights In General And Same-sex Unions In Particular.

Her personal life has been dedicated to a series of meaningless affairs - Lindsay simply doesn't have the time for anything more. No one is more surprised than Lindsay, therefore, when a beach house renovation she undertakes for interior designer Sondra Pinchot leads to an awakening of emotions that she had assumed were permanently dormant, as she finds herself drawn to the older divorcee, whose open, fragile nature stands in stark contrast to her own masked restraint. Perhaps it is inevitable, then, that later, when she and Sondra are hired jointly to complete the construction and design of an arts center, they acknowledge their mutual attraction. For Lindsay, it is an unexpected but not totally unwelcome adventure. For Sondra, who has all her adult life waged a losing battle with the bottle, and who as a result is basically estranged from her daughter Samantha, her headlong dive into forbidden love marks her return to old, destructive habits as her sobriety crumbles. So once again it is Samantha who is called in to clean up the mess her mother has made of her life, a role she has undertaken since she was a child. Temporarily leaving her own design business in Seattle, she places her mother in treatment, puts a hold on a stagnating relationship she has had with the same man for five years, and takes over for her mother by joining Lindsay in attempting to meet the completion date for the arts center project. Samantha and Lindsay begin to find themselves slipping into an unpredictable vortex of emotions, as they enter the shadow of a dangerous triangle in which love and anger meet and collide, igniting a passion so powerful that it threatens to consume them all.",en,,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",5.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/43/9780425156643.jpg,Success,126,19.6

Yet health and health care cannot be viewed outside of the social context. We cannot, William B. Rubenstein, Ruth Eisenberg, and Lawrence O. Gostin insist, lose sight of the fact that the questions involved in living with HIV disease are often human rights issues that are negotiated through the legal system. Can a hospital refuse to treat me because I’m infected? Can my insurance company terminate my coverage? Will the government deport me? Who has a right to know of my health status?</p>
<p>The health policies, practices, and programs generated by the HIV epidemic also give rise to legal questions: Can doctors be forcibly tested and removed from practice if they are infected with HIV? Can hospital patients be required to have HIV tests? What are the responsibilities of a pregnant woman with HIV infection? Do school children have a right to information about HIV disease?</p>
<p>In fact, legal questions affecting HIV-positive people have grown tremendously complex, cutting across multiple areas of life as well as of law. Using the question-and-answer format common to all ACLU handbooks, this book makes clear how to take advantage of the laws designed to secure the rights of people who are HIV positive.</p>
<p>The authors have divided the book into four sections. The first five chapters provide background information about HIV disease and about the public health response to the epidemic. The second five chapters deal with day-to-day issues: health care decisions, private and public insurance, available public benefits, planning in consideration of futureincapacity and death, and issues of HIV within families. The third section considers discrimination against people with HIV in accessing health care, in places of public accommodation, in the workplace, and in the housing market. The book concludes with a look at HIV in schools and prisons and among immigrants and drug users.</p>

Which Seems To Be Drawing Me To Itself. This Awakening To A Divine, Eternal Presence Is Always Described In Terms Of Wonder, Adoration, And Rapture, As An Ecstatic And Intimate Communion.^ Frequently, Accounts Of Such Glimpses Beyond The Curtain Of Day-to-day Reality Take The Form Of Poetry, And Often The Metaphors Used To Detail The Indescribable Are Those Of Passionate Union With A Divine Lover. From Sappho To Whitman, Vergil To Audre Lorde, Same-gender Lovers Have Been Foremost In The Ranks Of Artists Whose Work Reflects This Vision Of The Sacredness Of Love, A Belief That The Divine Revels In Our Passion For Joy And Beauty, And Manifests Through And In It. Now Andrew Harvey - Teacher, Poet, And Mystic, As Well As Frequent Writer And Lecturer On Mystic Experience, The Sufi Poet Rumi, And The Divine Feminine - Brings Together A Bountiful And Unprecedented Selection Of Gay, Lesbian, And Bisexual Writers Whose Works Illuminate The Mystical Path.^ Not Surprisingly, Many Of These Texts Take The Form Of The Most Ardent Love Lyrics And Psalms To Male And Female Beauty, For This Is The Radical Gift Of The Gay Mystics: The Lesson That The Transcendent Union With The Divine Can Come Through The Body And The Senses, Rather Than By Denial Of The Body And Asceticism. The Essential Gay Mystics Includes Texts From The Greeks And Romans (sappho, Plato, Euripides; Vergil, Horace, The Galli), The Native American Berdache Tradition, The Ancient Far East (qu Yuan, Kukai, Basho), And The Persian Sufi Traditions (attar, Sadi, Hafiz, Jami), As Well As Works From Literary Figures From The Renaissance To The Twentieth Century, Each Presented With A Short Biographical Introduction.^ Michelangelo, Who In His Sonnets Explored The Mystery Of The Relationship Between Human And Divine Beauty, Who Set Himself The Sacred Task Of Transmuting Human Desire Into Divine Love, Wrote, All That We Have Of Wisdom And Of Faith / Derives From Earth, And If I Love You With / Fervour, I Shall Reach God And Find Sweet Death. Harvey Asks Us To Consider Some Familiar Voices In A Different Light, As Well As Introducing Readers Of Some Less Well-known Writers Whose Words Fairly Scorch The Page.^ From The Ecstatic Poetry Of Seventeenth-century Spanish Nun Sor Juana Ines De La Cruz To Thoreau's Poignant Lately, Alas, I Knew A Gentle Boy To Emily Dickinson's Wild Nights And Curious Wine To The Hallucinatory Prose Of Jean Cocteau And The Gorgeous Hymn To Female Sexuality In Audre Lorde's Woman Forever, The Scope And Heartfelt Intensity Of These Selections Will Make The Essential Gay Mystics An Invaluable Sourcebook For All Seekers, Especially Gay Men And Lesbians Searching For Readings For Commitment Ceremonies And Other Celebratory Occasions.

1-55885-179-8,"The Twins, the Dream / Las Gemelas, El Sueno: Two Voices : Poems = DOS Voces : Poemas (English and Spanish Edition)","Bellessi, Diana, Le Guin, Ursula K.",Arte Publico Press,225,1/1/1996,"American Poetry, Latin American & Caribbean Poetry",Paperback,"<p>In The Twins, The Dream/Las Gemelas, El Sueno, two distinguished literary voices of the Americas offer a heartfelt meditation on language, love, personal identity, and the transforming power of friendship. The two authors, Diana Bellessi and Ursula K. Le Guin have translated each other's work as a means of bridging geographical distances and fostering cross-cultural dialog. More than a composite anthology, more than a joint translation, The Twins, The Dream/Las Gemelas, El Sueno is a model of the kind of poetry suitable for a new century in which the literature and art of this hemisphere will form the basis for integration rather than division.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Through correspondence, Le Guin, a prolific American writer (The Left Hand of Darkness; Unlocking the Air and Other Stories, etc.), and Bellessi, an Argentinean poet, collaborated on translating each other's poems to produce this intimate exchange of language and culture. The intrinsic value of this quirky edition lies in the bilingual presentation, for the two poets' success in reaching cross-cultural audiences is limited by their lack of expertise in translation. In Le Guin's hands, Bellessi's internal rhythms are lost and words are stripped of layers of meanings. For instance, the question ?Sabas/ cuando te encontr en Pars... sabas, que te hubiera hecho el amor? loses the poignant effect of the narrator's looking back at a youthful episode when Le Guin turns it into the statement You know, when I saw you in Paris... you know, I would have made love to you. Bellessi, in turn, overpowers Le Guin's direct voice, at times transforming her meaning entirely. In The House of the Spider: A Spell to Weave, Le Guin states: They are together,/ the brother,/ no other. Bellessi changes no other to el humano, shucking Le Guin's specific to express her own wider concerns. In their own languages, the poets' magic shines, as in Bellessi's adventurous Cruising the Equator and Le Guin's Dos Poesias para Mi Diana, which divulges not only the title for the book, but the intimate nature of poetry and this collaboration.
