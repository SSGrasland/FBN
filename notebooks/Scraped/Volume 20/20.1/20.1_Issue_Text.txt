The survey also noted that a number of gay men
received funding at early stages of their careers, after
their first or second publication. Funding at this
level has not been given to any overtly lesbian writ-
ers, nor do lesbian writers with one or two
publications seem to be considered for these grants,
despite the comparatively larger number of lesbian
writers with one or two or several successful publi-
cations to their credit.
