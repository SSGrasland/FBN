The territory of the mind and of madness can seem a foreign, even frightening place-until you read <i>Welcome to My Country</i>.<P>Writing in a powerful and original voice, Lauren Slater closes the distance between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them,&quot; transporting us into the country of Lenny, Moxi, Oscar, and Marie. She lets us watch as she interacts with and strives to understand patients suffering from mental and emotional distress-the schizophrenic, the depressed, the suicidal. As the young psychologist responds to, reflects on, and re-creates her interactions with the inner realities of the dispossessed, she moves us to a deeper understanding of the complexities of the human mind and spirit. And then, in a stunning final chapter, the psychologist confronts herself, when she is asked to treat a young woman, bulimic and suicidal, who is on the same ward where Slater herself was once such a patient.<P>Like <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>, <i>Listening to Prozac</i> and <i>Girl, Interrupted</i>, <i>Welcome to My Country</i> is a beautifully written, captivating, and revealing book, an unusual personal and professional memoir that brings us closer to understanding ourselves, one another, and the human condition.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>In this fittingly subtitled work, Slater introduces the schizophrenic, depressed, and suicidal patients she treats.

Cold Shoulder is the story of a young woman who has everything: a devoted husband, two beautiful daughters, and a successful career as a lieutenant with the Pasadena Homicide Squad. But when her partner is shot and dies in her arms, Lorraine's life starts to unravel. The after-hours drinking that once was social becomes her refuge, and soon she's not waiting until the end of her shift. From there it all comes undone with frightening speed: Drunk, she kills an innocent boy while on duty, is fired from the force, is abandoned by her family, and ends up living on the street as a prostitute. Cold Shoulder is the dramatic, frighteningly explicit account of Lorraine Page's fall and nightmarish recovery while caught between the danger of a serial killer on the loose and the manipulations of the old-boy police force that had ostracized her not so long before. The book reverberates with realism because it is based on a true story, one that has been meticulously researched and crafted by Lynda La Plante, a consummate expert in crime writing.

We are taken to the pristine trout streams of Montana, to the tarpon flats of the Florida Keys, and to the icy rivers of Sweden to fish for grayling.

She was born in a Russian <i>shtetl</i>, the precocious daughter of a rabbi. Her intellectual gifts garnered her an education usually reserved for boys, and she soon proved a brilliant writer, widely published while still in her teens. At age twenty-three she immigrated to Palestine, married a prominent Zionist journalist, and joined the literary intelligentsia of the emerging nation. Her writing showed startlingly modernist points of view (a day-old baby girl in ""The First Day"" and a female Jewish dog in ""Liska,"" for example), and she took on such topics as divorce (""Fradl""), incest (""Grandma Henya""), and domestic violence (""A Quarreling Couple""). But when her beloved brother died in 1923, Baron retired to her apartment. There she spent the last thirty years of her life, in touch with the literary community but rejecting her early stories as ""my rags."" She never left her residence and spent most of her time in bed, tended by her daughter.<br>
Israeli writer and psychologist Amia Lieblich was seventeen when Dvora Baron died; the two women never met. But Lieblich has written this biography as a series of conversations taking place in Dvora's darkened room during the last year of her life. Lieblich's vividly realized portrait elicits Dvora's memories of childhood; the descriptions of traditional women's lives in her writing; a view of her eccentric marriage and odd relationship with her daughter; and her thoughts on work, life, and death.<br>
Dvora is a living presence in these conversations; Lieblich approaches her as one of the great creative spirits of Hebrew literature. Having undergone a crisis in her own life, Lieblich seeks out Baron as a source of wisdom and direction. The result is an unusual and moving literary-psychological adventure that merges Dvora Baron's world with that of an Israeli woman today.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.02955876354 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/11/9780520085411.jpg,Success,124,20.2

His reputation as a poet of formidable talent is growing, he enjoys his work as a college professor and, perhaps most importantly, he is deeply in love with his partner of many years, Wally Roberts. The harmonious existence these two men share is shattered, however, when they learn that Wally has tested positive for the HIV virus.<P> From diagnosis to the initial signs of deterioration to the heartbreaking hour when Wally is released from his body's ruined vessel, <i>Heaven's Coast</i>is an intimate chronicle of love, its hardships, and its innumerable gifts. We witness Doty's passage through the deepest phase of grief &#151; letting his lover go while keeping him firmly alive in memory and heart &#151; and, eventually beyond, to the slow reawakening of the possibilities of pleasure. Part memoir, part journal, part elegy for a life of rare communication and beauty, <i>Heaven's Coast</i> evinces the same stunning honesty, resplendent descriptive power and rapt attention to the physical landscape that has won Doty's poetry such attention and acclaim.</p> <h3>The Advocate - Winston Wilde</h3> <p>Mark Doty&#39;s lyric recollections in his latest book, <i>Heaven&#39;s Coast,</i> on the dying of his lover, Wally Roberts, and on Doty&#39;s afterlife will undoubtedly be enshrined with the few other literary master relics of the gay American holocaust...<p> Although Doty is distinctly New England in his approach to writing, his queer sensibilities give him an American voice...His availability to the holiness of life, his balance of pragmatic skepticism and assured intuition, and his earthly drive to sniff &quot;the scented herbage of my breast,&quot; in Walt Whitman&#39;s words, are emblematic of the grace and grit of true queer spirit.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches",10.27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/56/9780060928056.jpg,Success,101,20.2

Ista is now a teenager, hip and computerwise. In fact, Ista spends a lot of her time in cyberspace, where AI programs reproduce themselves like rabbits and chickens and cats and sometimes like dinosaurs and mythical monsters. Scott has taken the cyberpunk subgenre of SF to another stage in Night Sky Mine, to a universe of cyberspace rich in self-replicating programs in danger of evolving out of human control. This is the story of Ista's quest for her true identity in a future where you cannot live without an official identity.

<p>In Bite Hard, poet Justin Chin explores his identity as an Asian, a gay man, an artist, and a lover. He rails against both his own life experiences and society's limitations and stereotypes with scathing humor, bare-bones honesty, and unblinking detail. Whether addressing ""what really goes on in the kitchen of Chinese restaurants"" or a series of ex-boyfriends, all named Michael, Chin displays his remarkable emotional range and voice as a poet.</p>
<p>His raw, incantatory, stream-of-consciousness poems confront issues of race, desire, and loss with a compelling urgency that reflects his work as a performance artist, speaking directly to an audience. Throughout this collection, Chin showcases his ability to convey thought-provoking viewpoints on a variety of controversial subjects. As R.

<p>Green sketches the ranks of both movements‚Äîwhich included women and men, black and white‚Äîand identifies the ways in which issues of class, race, and gender determined the composition of each side. Coming from a wide array of beliefs and backgrounds, Green argues, southern women approached enfranchisement with an equally varied set of strategies and ideologies. Each camp defined and redefined itself in opposition to the other. But neither was entirely homogeneous: issues such as states' rights and the enfranchisement of black women were so divisive as to give rise to competing organizations within each group. By focusing on the grassroots constituency of each side, Green provides insight into the whole of the suffrage debate.</p>",en,New edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 1.06262810284 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",11.23,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/14/9780807846414.jpg,Success,125,20.2

Since hierarchy rests on divisions which are in part gendered and sexualized, and co-operatives for the most part operate with flat or non-hierarchical structures, they could be seen as places where gender and sexuality make little difference to the experiences of workers.; This text takes issue with the assumption that where there is an absence of formal hierarchy in work and organizational life, there is likely to be an absence of gender inequalities.

<p>We all ""do deception"", often with the intention to protect ourselves and the relationships we depend on. <b>The Dance of Deception</b>unravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real ‚Äî even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave ‚Äî but misguided ‚Äî efforts to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women's lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of ""honesty"", we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling.</p>
<p>Sometimes Lerner's advice takes a surprising turn ‚Äî for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something ""more real""; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a ""hot issue"" without laying the necessary groundwork first.</p>

Amy Hoffman, a writer, lesbian activist, and former editor of Gay Community News, chronicles with fury and unflinching honesty her experience serving as primary caretaker for her friend and colleague, Mike Riegle, who died from AIDS-related complications in 1992. Hoffman neither idealizes nor deifies Riegle, whom she portrays as a brilliant man, devoted prison rights activist, and very difficult friend. <br>Hoffman became central to Riegle&rsquo;s caregiving when he asked her to be his health-care proxy, and although she willingly chose to do this, she explores her conflicting feelings about herself in this role and about her involvement with Riegle and his grueling struggle with hospitalization, illness, and, finally, death. She tells of the waves of grief that echoed throughout her life, awakening memories of other losses, entering her dreams and fantasies, and altering her relationships with friends, family, and even total strangers. <br>Hoffman&rsquo;s memoir gives voice to the psychological and emotional havoc AIDS creates for those in the difficult role of caring for the terminally ill and it gives recognition to the role that lesbians continue to play in the AIDS emergency. A foreword by Urvashi Vaid, former executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, offers a meditation on the politics of AIDS and the role of family in the lives of lesbians and gay men.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In Hospital Time, Boston-based writer Hoffman offers a sober examination of the caregiving role the gay and lesbian community has taken upon itself in response to the AIDS crisis. A lesbian caring for a dying gay friend, Hoffman describes the all too common situation of the gay or lesbian family replacing the biological family at the sick man's deathbed. Her memoir, which reads much like a novel, is built around the illness and death in 1992 of her difficult, brilliant friend, Mike Riegle. And though Hoffman alludes to her anger at Mike, she is unflagging in her commitment, including acting as his health-care proxy. She both understands and resents his idiosyncrasies about food, privacy, even sex, and she captures all the vacillating emotions that accompany caring for a dying loved one. She ultimately concludes, ""As angry as I got at him, as frustrated and upset, it didn't occur to me to stop, and he knew it wouldn't, and gave me his love and trust."" Hospital Time is an honest portrait of the complex emotions that come with caring for the terminally ill.

Another calls a centipede a ""comb."" An older child notices the mess in his younger brother's room and says, ""Wow, it sure is neat in here."" Children's spontaneous speech is rich in such creative, nonliteral discourse. How do children's abilities to use and interpret figurative language change as they grow older? What does such language show us about the changing features of children's minds?</p>
<p>In this absorbing book, psychologist Ellen Winner examines the development of the child's ability to use and understand metaphor and irony. These, she argues, are the two major forms of figurative language and are, moreover, complementary. Metaphor, which describes and sometimes explains, highlights attributes of a topic. As such, it serves primarily a cognitive function. Irony highlights the speaker's attitude toward the subject arid presupposes an appreciation of that attitude by the listener. In contrast to metaphor, irony serves primarily a social function. Winner looks in detail at the ways these forms of language differ structurally and at the cognitive and social capacities required for each.</p>
<p>The book not only draws on the author's own empirical studies but also offers a valuable synthesis of research in the area: it is the first account that spans the realm of figurative language. Winner writes clearly and engagingly and enlivens her account with many vivid examples from children's speech. The book will appeal to developmental psychologists, educators, psychologists of language, early-language specialists, students of literature, indeed, anyone who is delighted by the fanciful utterances of young children.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.322773572 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",11.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/55/9780674681255.jpg,Success,128,20.2

Modern sportfishing began in 1496 with the definitive ""Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle,"" attributed to English noblewoman and nun Dame Juliana Berners. During the five centuries since, women have made‚Äîand continue to make‚Äîfishing history. <br>
<br>
Reel Women tells the captivating stories of the daring and the ingenious who have made a lasting impact on sportfishing. More than a hundred profiles include such figures as tiny Mrs. Keith Spalding, who landed a 426-pound swordfish in 1921, plus the living legends of flyfishing, big-game saltwater fishing, and bass fishing: from Helen Robinson, who developed a groundbreaking technique for teasing billfish into striking an artificial fly, to Sugar Ferris, founder of the first bass-fishing circuit for women. <br>
<br>
Featuring a comprehensive women's angling resource directory and a bibliography of books by or for women anglers, Reel Women is a great catch for readers on the distaff side of the rod-and-reel world.

                        <p>Fishing has long been considered a man's sport. However, women today constitute more than one-third of all anglers and have displayed an avid passion for fishing since the late 1880s. Foggia, herself an avid angler, tells the complete story of fisherwomen for the first time. Photos.

Suddenly life in England is going to be completely different, especially for Ailith, a young Saxon wife. It is the year in which she loses both her husband and young son, and the year in which the Normans come, not as friends, but in search of conquest. Ailith's grief and despair run so deep that she would have done away with herself and joined her husband and son if a handsome, womanizing Norman, Rolf de Brize, had not happened by in the nick of time. Feeling strangely responsible for the woman whose life he has saved, the normally unreliable Rolf installs Ailith as chatelaine of Ulverton, his English estate. Despite his wife and daughter in France, he and Ailith eventually fall in love and have a daughter, Julitta. But can love truly conquer all - even Rolf's wife's decision to take her rightful place as mistress of Ulverton, and Ailith's discovery of a betrayal at the Battle of Hastings that she can never forgive?

                        <p>Can proud Ailith, widow of Goldwin the Armourer, find happiness with Rolf de Brize, the Norman who slew her brothers-and can she defeat the wife he left behind in Brittany?

Knapp explores the role played by women in ancient societies through analysis of specific myths from nine different lands. The author probes issues as to how figures such as Isis, Tiamat, Dido, Camilla, Deborah, Iphigenia, Salome, Sita, Amaterasu, Nu-Kwa, and others - some of whom were goddesses - fared. She discusses their abilities and their outlooks, whether their views were gender oriented or androgynous, whether they were deprived of the most basic human rights or excluded from the highest functions of religious worship. Knapp explores whether or not these women had done battle, led armies, founded states, ruled lands, or experienced identity crises. She allows the reader to establish parallels as well as dichotomies between the lives of ancient and contemporary women. The reliving of specific episodes from thousands of years ago as reported in the great myths brings insights into certain relationships and sheds light on events and their ramifications in today's home and workplace.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Knapp (Women in Twentieth-Century Literature: A Jungian View, Pennsylvania State Univ., 1987) analyzes myths from nine countries in order to reveal women's roles in ancient societies. She believes that myths are both ectypal (dealing with the existential world) and archetypal (dealing with eternal experiences); therefore, the popularity of a particular myth reveals the needs and deficiencies as well as the positive attributes of a given society. She notes that not even idealization enhanced the position of women. From this perspective, she studies myths of Isis, the maligned feminine in Enuma Elish, Deborah, Iphigenia (in Euripides), Salome (in Herodias), Dido and Camilla (in Virgil), Amaterasu (in Japanese sacred myth), various Chinese goddess-images, and Sita (in the Ramayana). This illuminating study raises contemporary issues, especially for readers who project their situation into the myths. Recommended for undergraduate and public libraries.Carolyn M.

In the very near future, sociologist/statistician Sandy Foster is researching the source of fads at a Dilbert-like corporation, Hi-Tek. Plagued by Flip, an airhead mail girl, she joins her research to that of Bennett O'Reilly, a chaos theorist studying information diffusion. As in the past, Willis moves her plot along through mix-ups and near-misses, a device that neatly embodies her theme of chaos. Chaos leads to a higher level of organization-breakthroughs in Sandy and Bennett's research, wealth and requited love. Flip, an echo of Robert Browning's Pippa, is an avatar of chaos whose passing alters lives. She's crucial to the story, so Sandy puts up with her in a way that's wimpy, annoying and unbelievable. Where the story's headed becomes transparent too early: the insight into the role of bellwethers in fomenting breakthroughs is not compelling. But none of that counts much against this bright romantic comedy, where the real pleasure is the thick layers of detail (researched or observed), and the wryly disdainful commentary on human stupidity. Something like a collaboration between Jane Austen and C. M. Kornbluth, it's sprightly, intelligent fun.

Unfettered by the moral opporbium that constrained&#151;or concealed&#151;male-male eroticism in Europe, male colors flew brightly in the public culture of urban Japan. Gary Leupp explores the practices and the cultural celebration of the Edo-era nanshoku tradition in this exuberant, sensitive, and yet dispassionate social and cultural history of male homoeroticism, the best modern scholarly study in English to date. Leupp ranges widely in a vast array of original literary, dramatic, and visual sources, which he brings to life with a finely textured use of comparative material from other traditions of male-male love both in East Asia and across the premodern world.

Bryant,Routledge,200,2/6/1997,"Bisexuality, Arts & Entertainment - Gay & Lesbian Studies, Peoples & Cultures in Film",Hardcover,"<p>How far have we progressed from the days when showing a film such as Jack Smith&rsquo;s Flaming Creatures landed the cinema&rsquo;s programmer, projectionist, and ticket taker in jail? What are some of the hidden clues modern audiences are overlooking in older films that suggest a character&rsquo;s bisexuality? Which famous actors, actresses, directors, and screenwriters were attracted to people of both sexes? In Bisexual Characters in Film, the first book to focus on the role of bisexual characters in film, you&rsquo;ll find answers to these questions and many more as you explore, analyze, and celebrate 80 years of bisexual movie characters (and the people who have created them) from around the world. A lively, entertaining, and informative commentary, this book examines the treatment of bisexual film characters and shows you how that treatment has been affected by societal forces such as censorship, politics, religious prejudices, homophobia, and sexual stereotypes. <p>Bisexual Characters in Film looks at the contribution of bisexual people (and others who have had lovers of varying sexes) to the body of work available on film today. These include the directors, writers, actors, composers, and designers whose sexual orientation has informed their work. An analysis of the Motion Picture Production Code and its devastating effect on bisexual and homosexual screen images forms an important part of the book. You learn how, specifically, it eradicated gay, lesbian, and bisexual characters from Hollywood films as well as the role of bisexual, lesbian, and gay filmmakers in finally defeating it. Other questions you&rsquo;ll find answers to include&#58;<BR><ul><li>Who, or what, is a bisexual?<BR><li>How were bisexual characters represented in silent film, before the forces of censorship banned them from the screen?<BR><li>What bisexual myths and stereotypes are portrayed on film?<BR><li>What is the role of &#8220;camp&#8221; in bisexual film?<p>Bisexual Characters in Film is a unique resource for researchers; librarians; film festival planners; the queer media; professors and students of lesbian, gay, and bisexual studies; bisexual activists; and general bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgendered readers. It provides a much-needed view of bisexual representations in a major segment of our popular culture.</ul></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>This work serves as a who's who of the genre, although a truly thought-provoking critique still must be written. A boardmember of the Bisexual Resource Center in Boston, Bryant examines more than 200 international films with a groundbreaking focus. As Bryant points out in his preface, almost nothing has been written specifically about bisexuality in movies. However, most of Bryant's selections have been discussed elsewhere, and Bryant's survey does not offer the deep critical analysis found in such lesbian and gay film monographs as Vito Russo's seminal The Celluloid Closet (LJ 6/1/81) and Chris Straayer's Deviant Eyes, Deviant Bodies (LJ 1/15/97). Still, its unique approach recommends this work for academic queer studies and film collections.Anthony J. Adam, Prairie View A&M Univ.

However, all too often, women in Western society view midlife as the beginning of the end. This, maintains Dr. Karen Kaigler-Walker, is tragic, for when women equate self-worth with socially dictated standards of youthful attractiveness, they run the risk of failing to fully develop their true selves. In Positive Aging, Dr. Kaigler-Walker illuminates the quest women must take to free themselves from this cultural trap to enjoy the fruits that aging can bring. Identifying the problem as essentially one of the spirit, she guides the reader in a step-by-step process to heal the wounds caused by such social standards. Through myths, fairy tales, and a series of practical exercises, the reader will learn to love herself and make conscious choices about her appearance - choices that reflect her midlife wisdom and inherent beauty.",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/40/9781573240840.jpg,Success,116,20.2

Our fear of intimacy‚Äîboth with others and with ourselves‚Äîcreates feelings of pain and longing. But these feelings can awaken in us the desire for freedom and the willingness to take up the spiritual path. In this inspiring book, Sharon Salzberg, one of America's leading spiritual teachers, shows us how the Buddhist path of lovingkindness can help us discover the radiant, joyful heart within each of us. This practice of lovingkindness is revolutionary because it has the power to radically change our lives, helping us cultivate true happiness in ourselves and genuine compassion for others. The author draws on simple Buddhist teachings, wisdom stories from various traditions, guided meditation practices, and her own experience from twenty-five years of practice and teaching to illustrate how each one of us can cultivate love, compassion, joy, and equanimity.</p>

Hay Was The First To Propose The Idea Of Gay Men And Lesbians As A Cultural Minority, The Very Basis Of The Gay Movement Today. For The Last Fifty Years, He Has Grappled With Each New Wave Of Cultural And Political Thought And Synthesized Agonizing Contradictions From Spirituality To Marxism, From Art To Politics. This First Collection Of Hay's Own Words - Speeches, Papers, And Interviews - Offers Invaluable Insight Into The Vision Of One Man Who Made It Possible For Millions To Live In Freedom And With Self-respect.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>in 1950, Hay And Fellow Activists In Los Angeles Founded The Mattachine Society, A Pioneering Homosexual Rights Group That Helped Lay The Groundwork For Contemporary Lesbian/gay Activism. This Collection Of Hay's Essays, Talks, Pamphlets And Manifestos Reflects His Insistence That Gays Are A Cultural Minority With Shared Values, Psychological Orientation, Historical Heritage And Modes Of Communication. This Perspective Flowed From Hay's Research Into French Renaissance Fool Societies, Which Staged Public Plays Spiked With Political Satire And Gender Reversal, And Into The Native American Berdache, A Practice Whereby Men Live As Women (or Vice Versa) And Combine The Work And Social Roles Of Both Sexes While Being Recognized As A Distinct Third Gender. In 1979, Hay And Others Launched The Radical Faerie Network, Providing Support Groups And Emphasizing Gay Spirituality To Counter Urban Depersonalization. His Pointed Critique Of Homophobia And His Exhortations To Gays Seeking Self-acceptance Make This Collection Especially Timely.

Tips range from getting debt under control to simplifying a wardrobe. Readers are frequently reminded that simplicity is more a matter of balance than deprivation; frugality may be a virtue, but so is the occasional indulgence. Notably absent is a significant discussion of environmentalism, a major impetus for the simplicity movement. Nor are the difficulties that simple living can create, e.g, in terms of time management and the social problems inherent in any practice that challenges the status quo, adequately addressed. Luhrs does include a chapter on such ""virtues"" as contentment, truthfulness, patience and mindfulness. The discussion of alternative housing offers intriguing accounts of those who have chucked the oversized colonial in favor of houseboats, living ""off the grid"" or cohousing with other families. Most readers will likely find greatest value in Luhrs's suggestions for simplifying the celebration of holidays, for eliminating clutter and traveling cheaply. Chock full of anecdotes and references from advocates of simplified living, ranging from Thoreau to Deepak Chopra, Luhrs's long and chatty, often rambling guide to simpler living seems a somewhat oxymoronic approach to the topic.

0-8135-2229-3,Congregations in Conflict: The Battle over Homosexuality,"Hartman, Keith",Rutgers University Press,195,1/1/1996,,Hardcover,"<p>A Methodist church puts its minister on trial after he marches in a gay rights parade. A Quaker meeting struggles to decide whether to marry a lesbian couple. An entire congregation is thrown out of the Southern Baptist Convention for deciding that a gay divinity student had a sincere calling to the ministry, and an order of celibate monks comes out of the closet. An Episcopal priest blesses two same-sex relationships--then a closeted gay lawyer leads the charge to have him fired.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is the most divisive issue facing churches today. Like the issue of slavery 150 years ago, it is a matter that ignites passionate convictions on both sides, a matter that threatens to turn members of the same faith against each other, to divide congregations, and possibly even to fragment several denominations. Like slavery, it is an issue that calls up basic questions about what it means to be a Christian. How does one know right from wrong? Is the Bible fallible? Do good Christians always follow their church's teachings, or are they allowed to think for themselves on moral issues? And to what source does one finally look to determine what God really wants?</p>
<p>While many books have been written analyzing the scriptural and theological dimensions of the conflict, none has yet shown how it is being played out in the pews. Congregations in Conflict examines nine churches that were split by disagreements over gay and lesbian issues, and how the congregations resolved them.</p>
<p>Hartman explores in very readable prose how different denominations have handled their conflicts and what it says about the nature of their faith. He shows some churches coming through their struggles stronger and more unified, while others irrevocably split.

Instead, it proves the plurality of this natural attribute, or biological drive. Within these pages, prominent psychologists, sociologists, and sexologists explore topics as diverse as sadomasochism in the therapy room, sexual exploitation in cults, and genderbending in cyberspace. Other chapters are firsthand accounts of personal struggles and triumphs and deal with issues such as coming out in a Christian fundamentalist community, breast cancer and self-image after surgery, and being HIV-positive when your partner is not. You‚Äôll leave this book with a heightened awareness of the full range of sexual experiences, sexual longings, sexual preferences, and sexual identities characterizing women‚Äôs lives.
<p>This volume makes clear in no uncertain terms that sexuality can no longer be swept into a single category. In a combined effort, the authors of Sexualities undermine patriarchal society‚Äôs inscribed gender roles and stereotypes and the restrictions and inhibitions the two cause. From the insight and expertise of the authors, you will acquire diverse and practical approaches to the subject(s) of sex that can be applied to the latest sexuality theories in your work. Among the exciting topics you will encounter in this groundbreaking book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>safer sex education for lesbians and bisexuals</li>
<li>parallels between migration, coming out, and psychological transformations</li>
<li>therapy as prostitution</li>
<li>the power dimension of sexual attraction</li>
<li>the lesbian sex therapist as object</li>
<li>the intersection of sex and religion in African-American communities</li>
<li>erotic themes in the mother-daughter relationship</li>
<li>cross-cultural aspects of sexuality 
<p>In a language that is accessible, frank, and often amusing, contributors from a multitude of backgrounds describe the ways they think about and apply the multiple meanings of sex to their lives and work. Psychotherapists; academics in women‚Äôs studies, gay and lesbian studies, and sexology; and lesbian and feminist professionals interested in current theories of sexuality will be inspired to examine their own notions of sexuality and recognize the diversity of women‚Äôs sexual goals and problems. This will help you in your day-to-day work, particularly as you address the needs and problems of women whose sexualities are different from your own.</p>

And in all of New York's Chinatown, there is no one like P.I. Lydia Chin, who has a nose for trouble, a disapproving Chinese mother, and a partner named Bill Smith who's been living above a bar for sixteen years. <P>Hired to find some precious stolen porcelain, Lydia follows a trail of clues from highbrow art dealers into a world of Chinese gangs. Suddenly, this case has become as complex as her community itself&#151;and as deadly as a killer on the loose...</p><h3>BookList</h3><p>It's always exciting to read the first novel of a newcomer with a distinctive voice and the talent to put a new spin on an established genre. Such is the case with this page-turning mystery introducing Lydia Chin, a Chinese American private investigator living in New York City's Chinatown. When the Chinatown Museum is robbed of a set of rare porcelains, the chair of the board of directors calls in her friend Lydia, despite the opposition of Lydia's brother, Tim, a board member embarrassed by his sister's occupation (not suitable for a respectable Chinese woman) and afraid that her failure to solve the crime will make him lose face. Working with her sometime partner Bill Smith, Lydia finds a connection between the shadowy underworld of the tongs (Chinese gangs) and the black market in stolen art, which leads in turn to violence and danger--definitely unsuitable surroundings in the eyes of Lydia's family. Rozan's Chinatown setting has the ring of authenticity, and Lydia is a true original. A very promising start to what shapes up as a top-flight series.</p>",en,First Edition,Weight: 0.3196702799 Pounds,7.19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/08/9780312955908.jpg,Success,34,20.2

-- An estimated 10 percent of men in the United States are either gay, bisexual, or questioning their sexual identity<br>
-- Provides a supportive, structured approach to an often intimidating process of self-examination and change<br>
-- Offers exercise to help readers identify personal fears and move beyond them
<p>Many of the books and articles about coming out focus on the external difficulties that gay or bisexual men face when they disclose their sexual orientation to others: ""How can I tell them? What should I say? How will they react?"" Less acknowledged is the internal struggle that many men undergo to define their sexual identity, accept its unique characteristics, and ""come out"" to themselves.</p>
<p>In Coming Out Every Day, Bret K. Johnson sensitively leads the questioning man through an admittedly challenging process of self-assessment. Nine chapters contain exercises and personal inventories to allow readers to examine the many aspects of their identity, work through barriers of shame and guilt, and take positive steps to integrate sexual feelings and needs into a conscious sense of self. The book offers a wealth of suggestions for finding support, developing strategies for coming out to others, and building healthy new relationships with families, friends, lovers, and partners.

Based upon seventeen years of fieldwork, life history work, qualitative analysis, archival work and contact with several thousand cross-dressers and sex-changers, the book develops a theory of 'male femaling' which has major ramifications for both the field of 'transvestism' and 'transexualism', and for the analysis of sex and gender more generally.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.06 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.79807338844 Pounds, Width: 0.46 Inches",72.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/52/9780415106252.jpg,Success,100,20.2

0-06-092836-0,Tales of Burning Love,"Erdrich, Louise",Perennial,464,2001,,Paperback,"<p><P>In her boldest and most darkly humorous novel yet, award-winning, critically acclaimed and bestselling novelist Louise Erdrich tells the intimate and powerful stories of five Great Plains women whose lives are connected through one man.<P> Stranded in a North Dakota blizzard, Jack Mauser&#39;s former wives huddle for warmth and pass the endless night by remembering the stories of how each came to love, marry and ultimately move beyond Jack. At times painful, at times heartbreaking and often times comic, their tales become the adhesive that holds them together in their love for Jack and in their lives as women. <P> Erdrich, with her characteristic powers of observation and luminescent prose, brings these women&#39;s unforgettable stories to life with astonishing candor and warmth. Filled with keen perceptions about the apparatus for survival, the force of passion and the necessity of hope, <i>Tales of Burning Love</i> is a tour de force from one of the most formidable American writers at work today.</p><h3>Kate Moses</h3><p><P>What a facile, hokey shaggy dog story Louise Erdrich has churned out in her sixth work of fiction! <i>Tales of Burning Love</i>, despite its over-the-top title, begins promisingly -- with a revisitation of the flashback opening of Erdrich's remarkable first book, <i>Love Medicine</i>. Again June Kashpaw walks to her death in a freak snowstorm the day before Easter, but this time her story is recalled by hapless Jack Mauser, the man who'd married her in a bar just hours before, and who, after June's death, goes on to marry four more women. Jack's wives, their relationships with him and with each other, form the foundation on which the novel's story is built. But this is spongy ground, destabilized by Erdrich's seemingly wholesale rejection of her gifts for enduring characterizations and clarified lyricism. Instead, we're offered characters that remain flat and prose that is more so, and Erdrich's familiar wild leaps of imagination and black humor are exaggerated into hopelessly earnest, bathetic melodrama. <P>Another snowstorm, this one following Jack's absurdist funeral (he's assumed incinerated after his house burns down, the ashy remains of a side of beef identified as what's left of his body), traps Jack's four latest ex-wives and a mysterious stranger for an all-night storytelling and stale-candy-eating session in a stranded car. A cartoonish brawl of old rivalries among the women prompts the gimmicky tales of burning love, a rash of stories so lurid and silly that they seem to keep the characters awake out of sheer embarrassment for the author. <P>Everyone survives, of course, including Jack, who never was dead at all, although there are a few other successful cremations sprinkled throughout the book, as well as assorted weepy psychological epiphanies and miracles. Yet the biggest miracle is that any of these women ever fall for a character as unappealing as Jack. His airless personality is summed up beautifully by his priceless reaction to the news that two of his ex-wives have formed a couple and are jointly raising the baby son born to his fourth spouse: ""So his son would grow up around a double set of gorgeous breasts -- once precious to Jack, now breasts that lived proudly, on their own terms, with other breasts.""

Stereotypes Depict Islamic Societies As Economically Backward, Hyper-patriarchal, And Fanatically Religious. But In Fact, The Islamic World Encompasses A Great Diversity Of Cultures And A Great Deal Of Variation Within Those Cultures In Terms Of Gender Roles And Sexuality. The First Collection On This Topic From A Historical And Anthropological Perspective, Homosexuality In The Muslim World Reveals That Patterns Of Male And Female Homosexuality Have Existed And Often Flourished Within The Islamic World. Indeed, Same-sex Relations Have, Until Quite Recently, Been Much More Tolerated Under Islam Than In The Christian West. Based On The Latest Theoretical Perspectives In Gender Studies, Feminism, And Gay Studies, Homosexuality In The Muslim World Includes Cultural And Historical Analyses Of The Entire Islamic World, Not Just The So-called Middle East. Essays Show Both Age-stratified Patterns Of Homosexuality, As Revealed In The Erotic And Romantic Poetry Of Medieval Poets, And Gender-based Patterns, In Which Both Men And Women Might, To Varying Degrees, Choose To Live As Members Of The Opposite Sex. The Contributors Draw On Historical Documents, Literary Texts, Ethnographic Observation And Direct Observation By Both Muslim And Non-muslim Authors To Show The Considerable Diversity Of Islamic Societies And The Existence Of Tolerated Gender And Sexual Variances.

Is her body an object? Is it the self? Is it both, and if so, how? Katharine Young takes up this problem in a book that looks at medicine's means of separating self and body-and at the body's ways of resisting.</p><p>Disembodiment-rendering the body an object and the self bodyless-is the foundational gesture of medicine. How, then, does medical practice acknowledge the presence of the person in the objectified body? Young considers in detail the choreography such a maneuver requires-and the different turns it takes during a routine exam, or surgery, or even an autopsy. Distinctions between public and private, inside and outside, assume new meanings as medical practice proceeds from one venue to the next-waiting room to examining table, anteroom to operating theater, from the body's exterior to its internal organs. Young inspects the management of these and other boundaries-as a physician adds layers of clothing and a patient removes layers, as the rules of objective and subjective discourse shift, as notions of intimacy determine the etiquette of exchanges between doctor and patient.</p><p>From embodied positions within the realm of medicine and disembodied positions outside it, Young richly conveys the complexity of presence in the flesh.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.13978989454 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches",24,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/16/9780674701816.jpg,Success,120,20.2
