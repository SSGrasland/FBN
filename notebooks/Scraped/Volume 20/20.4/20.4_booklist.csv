In the first work to separate fact from myth, Stuart Nicholson illuminates the complex details of Holiday's life, her artistry, and her musical legacy. Drawing on extensive interviews with those who knew and worked with Holiday, and on an exhaustive examination of newspaper accounts, court records, and FBI and police files, Nicholson uncovers a wealth of new information about Holiday's life and career. Included are her rape as an eleven-year-old, her battles with drug addiction and alcoholism, her arrest and imprisonment for heroin possession, her sex life, and her struggles against racial prejudice. Throughout his examination of Holiday's stormy life Nicholson weaves a revealing analysis of her performances and recordings. He traces the many strands of Holiday's career against the background of the mid-twentieth-century entertainment business and the day-to-day working environment of jazz musicians.

Yet on the outskirts of town an overturned carriage forces the shaken travelers to take refuge at a nearby manor house. And it is there that Jane meets the darkly forbidding yet strangely attractive Mr. Geoffrey Sidmouth. What murky secrets does the brooding Mr. Sidmouth seek to hide? Jane suspects the worst&#8212;but her attention is swiftly diverted when a man is discovered hanged from a makeshift gibbet by the sea. The worthies of Lyme are certain his death is the work of &quot;the Reverend,&quot; the ringleader of the midnight smuggling trade whose identity is the town's paramount mystery. Now, it falls to Jane to entrap and expose the notorious Reverend...even if the evidence points to the last person on earth she wants to suspect...a man who already may have won her heart.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Nearly as wry as Jane Austen herself, Barron delivers pleasure and amusement in her second delicious Jane Austen mystery (Jane and the Unpleasantness of Scargave Manor, 1996). While headed to Lyme Regis for a seaside holiday in 1804, the Austen carriage overturns and Jane's sister Cassandra is injured. The family finds shelter at High Down Grange, home of sardonic Geoffrey Sidmouth and his beautiful cousin Seraphine LeFevre. The narrative is structured as a journal in which Barron's Jane notes her distress at finding herself attracted to the sensuous Sidmouth. The Austens' trip is historically accurate but sparsely enough documented to allow Barron great latitude in creating a tale that makes the most of the period when the Napoleonic Wars raged and the coast was rife with smugglers. At the local Assembly dance, Jane gathers gossip from the Crawfords, Barnewalls, Lucy Armstrong and Captain Percival Fielding, an injured naval officer, who hints that Sidmouth is the Reverend, a notorious smuggler. When Fielding is murdered and Sidmouth arrested, a customs agent asks Jane to conduct an undercover investigation. She eagerly agrees. With indefatigable daring and intelligence, Jane discovers the true natures of her new acquaintances and the meaning of heroism. While Austen denied that her characters were based on real people, Barron cleverly turns to characters from Austen novels as models for her own: Mrs. Bennet for Mrs. Austen, Willoughby for Sidmouth, Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy for Jane's with Sidmouth. Worthy of its origins, this book is a delight.

This collection looks at right-wing ideology and its relation to gender in a variety of historical and cultural contexts, including women's writing, children's stories, film, books, magazines, and propaganda pieces. The volume addresses the question of whether fascism's stereotype as ""a pathologically masculine"" ideology is indeed true. Essays explore topics like women and anti-Semitism during the Dreyfus affair, Genet and the fantasy of homo-fascism, gendered eugenics, and female icons during the Vichy period. Locating the intersection of gender and the right, the editors explain, significantly alters traditional perspectives on French culture in this century, thereby bringing to light not only new objects of study but challenging a priori assumptions about France's cultural politics.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/46/9780874518146.jpg,Success,119,20.4

Moreover, as the epitome of eighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophy, his thought has been a focal point for feminist debate over the Enlightenment legacy—whether its conceptions of reason and progress offer tools for women's emancipation and empowerment or, rather, have contributed to the historical subordination of women in Western society.</p>
<p>This volume presents radically divergent interpretations of Kant from feminist perspectives. Some essays see Kant as having contributed significantly to theories of rationality and autonomy in ways that can further feminist projects. Other essays argue that Kant is a preeminent exponent of patriarchal views and that gender hierarchies are inscribed in the very structure of his theories of morality and aesthetic judgment. But both critics and sympathizers challenge the accepted topography of Kantian philosophy by which central philosophical concerns are defined as those that are abstract, universal, and transcendental. Instead, these feminist writers resituate Kantian questions in the politics of everyday life and emphasize the embodied nature of knowledge, morality, and aesthetics. They analyze dilemmas that face concrete subjects, involving issues of friendship, collective responsibility, xenophobia, and colonialism, among others.</p>

During the Occupation, when she was twenty years old, she drifted into the Polish Underground. By her own admission, she was attracted at first by the adventure, but youthful bravado soon turned into a mental and spiritual mastery over fear. Because Krystyna spoke fluent German she was assigned to collect information on German troop movements at Warsaw airport. In 1942, at the age of twenty-one, she was arrested by the Gestapo and transferred to prison in Berlin where she was executed two years later. In the last eighteen months of her life Krystyna wrote over sixty letters which, through the kindness of a courageous prison guard, were smuggled to her parents or the guard's daughter who became her penpal. From the moment she was arrested, Krystyna would not allow her spirit to be broken and believed that ""the noble that is within us will not perish."" It is Krystyna's humanity that unites her with other victims of war and other resistance fighters, and enables us to identify with her even though her ordeal was outside the scope of our experience.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.70988848364 pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/52/9781550650952.jpg,Success,55,20.4

Fat--A Fate Worse Than Death? offers hardy resistance to the narrow, random, and irrational appearance standards set for American women through an approach that is personal, eclectic, courageous, and funny. If you are interested in giving up your diet, throwing out your scales, and concentrating on who you are on a deeper level, this book will show you how to accept, appreciate, and even love your body!<p>Using statistics, research, anecdotes, and personal experiences, Fat--A Fate Worse Than Death? explores how appearance standards have built a prison for women. With the book&rsquo;s helpful advice, reading suggestions, and list of more than 100 ways to fight looksism, sexism, ageism, and racism, you will learn to express your rights and needs, regardless of your shape or size, and tear down those prison walls.

Don&rsquo;t live silently in a society that degrades and discounts women because of their physical stature and don&lsquo;t let obsession with thinness keep you passive, docile, and unable to give your energy to things that really need your passion and intelligence. Read this book and learn to not only value yourself for who you are, but also to counteract American culture&rsquo;s equality-denying prejudices and practices.</ul></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Thone, a self-described ""fat and old,"" white-haired, 65-year-old feminist, rails against a society that values youth and slenderness above all else, sparing no one from her radical language. Her palpable outrage certainly strikes a chord""We surround ourselves with images of starving women, bottom ribs removed, anorexic, bulimic, skeleton-like, reminiscent of extreme starvation, protruding pelvic bones, gaunt, gorgeous we think""but it can sound rather extreme, especially when Thone deems Naomi Wolf's work ""foolish and retrogressive in spirit and fact,"" or when she repeatedly calls on doctors to cease linking ill health with obesity and to stop weighing their patients. Her haphazard, stream-of-consciousness style lacks organization; her tendency to lapse into lengthy lists of favorite feminist works further detracts. The alienation intensifies as Thone whines about her rarefied political social circle that parties at the White House, complains about her visit to a French masseuse, and advocates taking ""time to be naked in front of a mirror."" By the time she announces that all this anger has been for naught""I know I am making a scapegoat of being old and heavy to avoid insecurities that I have carried for a lifetime. That is one of the truths that can make me free, once I emotionally get hold of it, and face the insecurities, and not rail about our appearance-obsessed culture""she has already lost her readers.

Throughout the book, the connections Marion Arnold makes between ideas, artists and their works are always illuminating and often unexpected.

<p>Sojourner Truth first gained prominence at an 1851 Akron, Ohio, women's rights conference, saying, ""Dat man over dar say dat woman needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches. . . . Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles . . . and ar'n't I a woman?""</p>
<p>Sojourner Truth: ex-slave and fiery abolitionist, figure of imposing physique, riveting preacher and spellbinding singer who dazzled listeners with her wit and originality. Straight-talking and unsentimental, Truth became a national symbol for strong black women—indeed, for all strong women. Like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, she is regarded as a radical of immense and enduring influence; yet, unlike them, what is remembered of her consists more of myth than of personality.</p>
<p>Now, in a masterful blend of scholarship and sympathetic understanding, eminent black historian Nell Irvin Painter goes beyond the myths, words, and photographs to uncover the life of a complex woman who was born into slavery and died a legend. Inspired by religion, Truth transformed herself from a domestic servant named Isabella into an itinerant pentecostal preacher; her words of empowerment have inspired black women and poor people the world over to this day. As an abolitionist and a feminist, Truth defied the notion that slaves were male and women were white, expounding a fact that still bears repeating: among blacks there are women; among women, there are blacks.</p>
<p>No one who heard her speak ever forgot Sojourner Truth, the power and pathos of her voice, and the intelligence of her message. No one who reads Painter's groundbreaking biography will forget this landmark figure and the story of her courageous life.</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.6 Inches, Weight: 0.7605948039 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/84/9780393317084.jpg,Success,131,20.4

At the same time, she argues, the homoerotics of women's writing has too often gone unremarked. Not only does longing for an ideal listener draw women's texts into a romance with the reader, but there is an erotic excess which is part of feminist critical recuperation itself.</p><p>Drawing on a wide range of resources, from sociolinguistics and anthropology to literary theory, Kaplan's highly readable study proposes a new model for understanding and representing talk. She supplies fresh readings of such feminist classics as <em>Jane Eyre</em>, The Yellow Wallpaper, <em>Incidents in the</em> <em>Life of a Slave Girl</em>, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, and <em>The Color Purple</em>, revealing how their erotics of talk works as a rich political allegory and form of social critique.</p>",en,1st Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 0.8487797087 Pounds, Width: 0.759 Inches",56.47,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/57/9780195099157.jpg,Success,115,20.4

Traditionalists And Feminists Alike View Hunting As A Symbol For Men's Activity In The World - Ignoring The Reality Of Women Hunters Now And In The Past. In Fields From Anthropology To Religion And In Movements From Environmentalism To Feminism, Women Are Often Seen As Nonviolent And Allied With The Natural World; Men As Aggressive And Alienated From Nature.

If Instead We See People As Part Of Nature, Stange Argues, Then Hunting Takes On Symbolic Value For Us All.

Some were captured by Indians. Cynthia Ann Parker, assimilated to the Comanche tribe after being captured as a child, was later recaptured by U.S. soldiers who killed her Comanche husband and separated her forever from her sons. Pioneer Fanny Kelly spent five months as a captive of the Sioux; she went on to write a clearheaded book about her experiences. Some, like missionary Mary Richardson Walker and the independent Dr. Bethenia Owens-Adair, showed great dedication to their work. Some were adventurous. Molly Slade, fiercely loyal to her ruthless husband, once helped him escape a band of outlaws intent on killing him. The intrepid Isabella Bird reported on her solitary travels in the Wild West, while Army wife Elizabeth Custer rode out with her husband’s cavalry one spring. Others proved their grit as homesteaders. All these women, and more, figure unforgettably in Some <i>Went West</i>.

                        <p>Describes the lives and varied experiences of some of the many women who traveled across the American West, including Cynthia Ann Parker, Mary Richardson Walker, Harriet Sanders, Maria Virginia Slade, and Elizabeth Custer.

You'll find a collection of pieces on specific potentially problematic therapy conditions that allows you to easily turn to your area of interest for advice. Each chapter stands alone while building upon the big picture of feminist ethics and therapy with children and adolescents. Providing a feminist focus on the mental health rights and needs of children and adolescents, Children's Rights, Therapists’Responsibilities: Feminist Commentaries emphasizes our need to make the best decisions without letting personal prejudices, biases, experiences, needs, or desires cloud our judgment. A particular point of view exposes the tendency for therapists to work either with children and exclude parents, or to work with parents and exclude the children, and offers a feminist view of parents and children being treated together. Other helpful things you'll find include:
<ul>
<li>critical analysis of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</li>
<li>presentation and recommendation of the “Feminist Model of Ethical Decision-Making”</li>
<li>information on respecting the human rights of the children with disabilities and children of color</li>

Many women who had traditionally been employed as domestic servants left their employment for jobs where remuneration was higher, hours of work better defined and protective measures applied. The State then turned to other countries, to women of color from the Third World, notably the Caribbean and the Philippines for domestic workers. This led to a change in immigration policy; the State began to import foreign domestic workers to work for low wages, under adverse conditions, with no labor and mobility rights. North America was seen by these women as an economic opportunity, even if they were forced to work as domestics, the wages were higher than in their country of origin.
<p>Tanya Schecter argues that the State consciously acted to take advantage of these women's desperation, of their poverty, in order to find a cheap supply of domestics for its own citizens while limiting its own social expenditures.</p>
<p>In ""Race, Class, Women and the State"" she traces the role of the State in setting the policies that have allowed North American women to increase their participation in the public sphere, while at the same time keeping the public-private divide and its attendant value structure much the same as they were at the turn of the century: that is, domestic labor and child care remain women's responsibility and are valued less than work performed in the public sphere. It shows how women are overwhelmingly forced to work a double day. Moreover, for many immigrant women of color, their double day increasingly takes place in the home as they are forced to work in other women's homesperforming domestic duties for low wages.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.38360433588 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",24.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/89/9781551641089.jpg,Success,56,20.4

Her first marriage, to Desmond FitzGerald, one of the founders of the modern CIA, failed ultimately because she was too independent and insisted on a career of her own. Of course, that she had met and fallen in love with Ronald Tree, an immensely wealthy and attractive member of the upper echelons of British society, also played a part in the breakup of her marriage. As the wife of Ronald Tree, Marietta was introduced to British society but found that world somewhat too stuffy for her tastes. It was when she and Ronnie moved their base of operations from England to New York and Barbados, however, that Marietta's true strengths as hostess and confidante to the rich and powerful came to the fore. Using these talents, she developed a close alliance with Adlai Stevenson and worked tirelessly for him during his unsuccessful bids for the U.S. presidency. In gratitude, he arranged her appointment as U.S. delegate to the Human Rights Commission under the sponsorship of the United Nations. Marietta Tree's untimely death in 1991, of cancer, marked the end of an era. She was among the last of a small, select group of women - which included Pamela Harriman and Slim Keith - who helped define the new standards of American womanhood. Passionately involved in civil rights and Democratic politics, Marietta Tree harnessed her femininity, wit, and intelligence to the cause of public service, and in so doing, found the energy and strength to be a truly independent spirit.",en,,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.65126234238 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/89/9780684810089.jpg,Success,136,20.4

The topics they wrote about were as wide-ranging as their interests and experiences, and their correspondence encompassed many of the varied events of their lives. Laurence's letters - of which far more are extant than Wisman's - reveal much about the impact of her years in Africa, motherhood, her anxieties and insecurities, and her developement as a writer. Wiseman, whose literary success came early in her career, provided a sympathetic ear and constant encouragement to Laurence.</p>
<p>The editors' selection has been directed by an interest in these women as friends and writers. Their experiences in the publishing world offer an engaging perspective on literary apprenticeship, rejection, and success. The letters reveal the important roles both women played in the buoyant cultural nationalism of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>This valuable collection of previously unpublished primary material will be essential to scholars working on Canadian literature and of great interest to the general reading. The introduction contextualizes the correspondence and the annotations to the letters help to clarify the text. The Laurence-Wiseman letters offer a fascinating glimpse into the lives and friendship of two remarkable women whose personal correspondence was written with verve, compassion, and wit.</p>",en,Annotated,"Height: 8.99 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.4550509292 Pounds, Width: 1.28 Inches",33.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/05/9780802080905.jpg,Success,55,20.4

Her intention is to show that Habermas's theory of modernity is so structured that it cannot achieve its universalist aims.

In a context where heterosexuality and 'normality' were understood to be synonymous and assumed to be necessary for social and national stability, teenagers were the target of a range of materials and practices meant to turn young people into proper heterosexuals.</p><p>In this study, Mary Louise Adams explores discourses about youth and their place in the production and reproduction of heterosexual norms. She examines debates over juvenile delinquency, indecent literature, and sex education to show not why heterosexuality became a peculiar obsession in English Canada following the Second World War as much as how it came to hold such sway.</p><p>Drawing on feminist theory, cultural studies, and lesbian/gay studies, <b>The Trouble with Normal</b> is the first Canadian study of 'youth' as a sexual and moral category. Adams looks not only at sexual material aimed at teenagers but also at sexual discourses generally, for what they had to say about young people and for the ways in which 'youth,' as a concept, made those discourses work. She argues that postwar insecurities about young people narrowed the sexual possibilities of both young people and adults.</p><p>While much of the recent history of sexuality examines sexuality 'from the margins,' <b>The Trouble with Normal</b> is firmly committed to examining the 'centre,' to unpacking normality itself. As the first book-length study of the history of sexuality in postwar Canada, it will make an important contribution to the growing international literature on sexual regulation.</p>",en,First Soft-Cover Edition,"Height: 8.97 Inches, Length: 5.99 Inches, Weight: 0.9259415004 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",2.48,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/78/9780802080578.jpg,Success,56,20.4

She should. In the ring, she's the London Lassassin, with a reputation as one of the meanest, toughest villains in the business. She's permanently banned from the ring, broke, and out of shape, but Eva, the London Lassassin, figures it will take a lot worse than that to floor her. That's before she finds a sports bag stuffed with bank notes in one of her serially ""borrowed"" cars. Soon Eva has big dreams of staging a wrestling comeback. Then her newfound loot brings her a tougher audience than any she's ever faced down. It isn't long before Eva's confronting dangerously inept thugs with the nerve to shadow her all over London. Or having to show some muscle when one or two mistake her for a lightweight. Or daring to trace the money to its chilling, deadly source. Being down-and-out only makes Eva meaner than ever.

So begins Martha McCaughey's odyssey into the dynamic world of women's self- defense, a culture which transforms women involved with it and which has equally profound implications for feminist theory and activism.<p>Unprecedented numbers of American women are learning how to knock out, maim, even kill men who assault them. Sales of mace and pepper spray have skyrocketed. Some 14 million women own handguns. From behind the scenes at gun ranges, martial arts dojos, fitness centers offering Cardio Combat, and in padded attacker courses like Model Mugging, <B>Real Knockouts</B> demonstrates how self-defense trains women out of the femininity that makes them easy targets for men's abuse.<p>And yet much feminist thought, like the broader American culture, seems deeply ambivalent about women's embrace of violence, even in self-defense.

When Middlebrook's husband asked the surgeon for an honest prognosis, she told him his wife had a 50 percent chance of surviving two more years. Unlike the many upbeat books that end with the author triumphing over his or her illness through traditional or alternative medicine, or by some variation of mind over matter, this book offers no naive conclusion. What it does give is a picture of family love, including lessons in dealing with pain so real and unflinching that readers will cling to Middlebrook even as she takes them right to the edge of the abyss.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/55/9780385488655.jpg,Success,124,20.4

Hernandez Shows Us A Young Girl's Struggle To Make Something Of Herself And Break Free Of A Stereotype That Has So Long Plagued The Hispanic Community. Each Chapter Is A Vignette, And Each Chapter Title Maintains The Tortilla Metaphor. The Reader Is Shown The Positive And Negative Pressure Put On Luz By Herself, Her Family, And Her Community. Through It All, Luz Remains Determined To Succeed And Someday Meet Her Goal Of Going To College, Something Not Common For A Hispanic Female In Her World. Hernandez's Intentions Are Honorable. She Does A Wonderful Job Examining All Of The Pressures Young Girls Are Under Today. The Reader Will Learn A Good Deal About The Hispanic Culture, Including The Folklore And The Pressure Young Girls Feel From The Older Members Of The Community To Marry Young And Become Good Mothers. Hernandez Presents The Story In Multigenerational Voices, Highlighting The Women's Perspectives Of Events That Have Or Will Shape Their Lives. Unfortunately, The Story Tends To Be A Bit Heavy-handed. Every Page Seems To Contain A Lesson To Be Learned, And The Didactic Tone Does Not Free The Reader To Enjoy The Story. Readers May Also Find The Vignette Style Puzzling. Often It Requires Reading A Page Or Two Before Making The Transition To The Next Story Line.

Including women married and single, young and old, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual, the anthology covers historical development and changing mores through the seventeenth century, after the Restoration of Charles II, a time of relative freedom for women; the eighteenth century, when the cult of romantic friendship reached its peak; the nineteenth century, when women writers wrote about issues of same-sex desire indirectly and explored complex issues such as death in tones of weariness and resignation; and the twentieth century, when poets began to engage in more overt explorations of women's bodies, sensuality, and lovemaking. Emma Donoghue's introduction deftly guides readers into the rich tradition of women's poetry in English, exploring the relationships between poets and their muses and poets and their cultures. Poems Between Women is testimony not only to the recurring theme of the unique bonds among women but also to the universality of love, friendship, and creativity.                        <p>1998 Lambda Literary Awards, spirituality/religion category</p>",en,0,"Height: 8.56 Inches, Length: 5.81 Inches, Weight: 1.02 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches",27,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/46/9780231109246.jpg,Success,112,20.4

The author addresses the work of eminent modernists (e.g., Woolf, Spark, Lessing, Bowen) along with more experimental narratives (. . . Emma Tennant, Fay Weldon, Jeanette Winterson). . . .

1-55111-127-6,Counterbalance: Gendered Perspectives on Writing and Language,,Broadview Press,400,2/2/1996,,Paperback,"<p>Like other composition readers, Counterbalance has as its primary purpose to improve thinking, reading and writing skills, recognizing throughout the degree to which these are inextricably interlinked. Where Counterbalance differs from almost all other composition readers is in the prominence it gives to writing by women. More and more of the writers in modern Western society are women and women now comprise a substantial majority of the students in many undergraduate courses. Yet most texts are eighty per cent or more comprised of writing by men. As its title suggests, this book acts as a counterbalance; over three-quarters of the essays are by women.</p>
<p>The feminist stance of Counterbalance is unequivocal; an important aim of this text is to encourage students to question assumptions about gender. But for those to whom the word 'feminist' engenders immediate unease, it should be emphasised that the stance of the text is provocative and open-minded rather than strident or exclusionary; Audre Lorde and bell hooks are here, but so is George Orwell.</p>
<p>The text is also designed as a counterbalance in other respects; many of the essays here explore issues of race, culture and class. Notions of correctness and issues of free speech and responsibility are also treated. As a whole the book is thus an invigorating and enormously wide-ranging spur to thought and discussion. Yet it avoids the scatter-gun approach so common to first-year collections; Counterbalance retains throughout a focus on language—perhaps the one area that all students, no matter what their backgrounds and interests, can connect to out of their everyday experience. The book's thesis is that we can all think more clearly and use language more effectively if we know not only something about the traditional areas of composition and grammar but also something about how language influences us. The essays selected demonstrate a variety of expository styles, organizations and methods of development. They are organized into seven chapters so as to present a coherent progression, moving from simpler essays on more familiar topics to more difficult concepts and writing assignments.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.19270083742 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/78/9781551111278.jpg,Success,110,20.4

They Are Too Busy Scrambling To Earn A Living; Even If There Is An Involved Father, Mom Can't Afford To Stay Home Anymore. In A Relatively Short Text (there Are More Than 40 Pages Of Notes And Bibliography), Stacey Argues That Poverty And Unemployment, Among Other Social And Economic Forces, Have Driven The Reshaping Of The American Family And That Critics, Whether On The Right Or The Left, Have Two Choices&#58; They Can Accept And Work With The Array Of Families As They Actually Exist, Or They Can Continue To Deny Conditions As They Are. Moreover, She Finds That Reorganized Families Cut Across Economic And Class Lines; They Are Not Limited To Either The Poor Or The Upper Middle Class.

The task her father has given her is to learn twenty words a day, read the New York Times at least twice a week and watch Masterpiece Theatre whenever he tells her to, mostly because he likes it. Then Billie discovers her sister's secret&#58; Cassie is battling anorexia and Billie's parents excuse Cassie's weight loss as stress due to the competitive atmosphere at college. Billie knows something is drastically wrong with her sister; something that could be fatal.<P>This novel is touching and funny and moving, and it got great reviews. And Billie Weinstein is so wry and humorous a protagonist, she's the kind of girl every woman wishes she'd had as a best friend growing up.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A medical case guide couldn't present the pathology of anorexia more clearly than this coming-of-sexuality novel does. But Hanauer goes beyond Judy Blume-style fictionalizing of symptoms: her uncanny ear for dialogue creates a dead-on characterization of driven Jewish intellectual snobbery set against Italian working-class earthiness. To keep their two daughters, Cassie and narrator Billie, from growing up spoiled, Michael and Jane Weinstein have chosen to raise them not in North Berry, N.J., where the women's room in the country club offers hair-straightening irons, but in West Berry, a world of Vinnies and Dominicks where wrestling is more important than SATs. Michael is a type A surgeon. His relentless pressure has pushed Cassie into Best Athlete/Most Likely to Succeed high-school performance-which is quickly followed, during her first semester at Cornell, by a descent into anorexia and its attendant anxieties. Because of Michael's denial and Jane's desire to please, the wonderfully sensitive and assertive Billie is left to do most of the worrying about ""my sister, hyper and bony, wasting away,"" even while she grapples with her own issues of desire and achievement. The struggles over control in Hanauer's neatly executed first novel go straight to the heart.

0-14-025427-7,The Concubine's Children,"Chong, Denise",Penguin Canada,304,1/2/1996,,Paperback,"<p>The ethos of family is dramatically portrayed by Denise Chong in this tale of her grandmother, brought from China as a young concubine by a sojourner to the New World, of the man's wife and the children who would be left behind, and of the author's own incredible discovery of those children six decades later. Here is a true story, woven from letters, photographs, and memories, with more twists and turns than any novel. It is a story of the lives of one family living on two different sides of the globe: in a village in South China before and after the Communists took power, and in the gritty Chinatowns on North America's west coast. The ""at-home"" wife would hold sacred the honor of the family; supporting her was the concubine who sacrificed her own family in working the tea houses abroad, in ""Gold Mountain."" In tow was her youngest daughter, the author's mother. It was she who unlocked the past for her daughter, whose curiosity about some old photographs ultimately reunited this family, who had been divided for most of this century.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>This superbly told saga of family loyalties and disaffections reads more like a novel than an actual chronicle of Chan Sam, a Chinese peasant who left his family in 1913 to seek his fortune in the ``Gold Mountain'' of western Canada. There, though always planning to return to them, he set up a second family with the beautiful, headstrong concubine he brought with him from China. The story is narrated in the third person by his granddaughter, a Canadian economist, who creates an unsentimental portrait of both families: of Huangbo, the patient ``home-wife'' who raised their son and the two children the concubine, May-ying, left behind, and survived the Japanese occupation of China and the rule of Mao Tse-tung; of May-ying, whose earnings as a waitress in west coast teahouses often supported the struggling Chan Sam, his family in China and her own two Canadian-born children. And we learn of the fate of all the children, especially May-ying's daughter Hing, the author's mother. Although Chan Sam never fulfilled his dream of returning to his home-family, after his death, Hing and the author made the pilgrimage to China to embrace the relatives they had never known. Photos.

Someone has broken into a greenhouse, trashed some plants, and stolen a batch of seed that was being dried. And, in a second incident, vials with genetic material have been stolen from two students who were studying how genes affect growth. Just pranks, or sabotage? And if the events are malicious, are they aimed at individuals or the entire lab?

It's safer, by far, to put their problems into Catherine's capable hands. But when two researchers die in mysterious circumstances, Catherine knows there's far more at stake than sabotaged research. And she must work alone, as Kendra Crawford and her colleagues seem unwilling to admit the seriousness of the situation. Catherine must also deal with the psychological wounds left by previous violent cases and her growing attraction to Paul Raskin, who threatens to become more than just a client.

This informative book gives you self-monitoring tools for collecting information and monitoring changes in your body during menopause. These tools will also help you understand the dynamics of the change process. A guideline as to how to best use this information when interacting with care providers—especially those who view menopause as a disorder to be treated—is also included.</p>
<p>Menopause, Me and You is filled with information-gathering tools, scientific facts, and stories from the true “experts” on menopause—the women themselves who have experienced or are experiencing menopause. In chapter after chapter, you’ll gain valuable information for viewing menopause from a woman-centered perspective. Specifically, the book includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>detailed information on conception and fertilization, reconceptualizing these events from a woman-centered, feminist perspective</li>
<li>a description and reconceptualization of the menstrual cycle and menstruation, providing the knowledge base—the physiological, endrocrinological, and biochemical mechanisms that regulate the menstrual cycle and menstruation—to understand menopause as the closure of menstrual life and not the end of life</li>
<li>a journey into the steroid hormone target cell—shows, at a scientific level, that women were genetically programmed to end the production of reproductive hormones</li>
<li>a description and clarification of some of the terms used to describe menopause</li>
<li>common menopausal changes and diseases attributed to being estrogen-deficient</li>
<li>tools for gathering information, for “discovering knowledge,” about yourself—a menstrual calendar card, hot flash body diagrams, a basal body temperature record, a body composition record, a menstrual bleeding scale, and factors to consider when choosing a care provider
<p>The women who share their experiences in Menopause, Me and You represent women at various stages of menopause. They describe for you what they are feeling as well as what it means to be a mid-life woman at the closure of reproductive life; they celebrate the end of menstruation but curse the changes—including mood swings, hot flashes, and vaginal/bleeding changes—they are experiencing. These changes are normal and expected, however, and need to be understood in that context. They are not symptoms of disease or an excuse for care providers to instantly prescribe hormones or drugs.</p>
<p>With the information in Menopause, Me and You, women nearing or experiencing menopause, health care providers, such as nurses, health educators, and physicians, and counselors will better understand how women view this transition and come to accept it as another normal, necessary, and beautiful process in the lives of women.</p>

Yet recent debates in deconstruction have shown that gender has never been a stable matter. In the history of philosophy 'female' and 'woman' are full of ambiguity. What does deconstruction have to offer feminist criticism of the history of philosophy?<BR> <EM>Yielding Gender</EM> explores this question by examining three crucial areas; the issue of gender as 'troubled'; deconstruction; and feminist criticism of the history of philosophy. The first part of the book discusses the work of Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, and contemporary French feminist philosophy including key figures such as Luce Irigiray. Particular attention is given to the possibilities offered by deconstruction for understanding the history of philosophy.<BR> The second part considers and then challenges feminist interpretations of some key figures in the history of philosophy. Penelope Deutscher sketches how Rousseau, St. Augustine and Simone de Beauvoir have described gender and argues that their readings of gender are in fact empowered by gender's own contradiction and instability rather than limited by it.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches",50.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/58/9780415139458.jpg,Success,135,20.4

Moreover, he does so in a style-labyrinthine, many-voiced, multilayered, adverse to authority-that adumbrates <em>Ã©criture fÃ©minine</em>.</p><p>A major question probed in the volume is whether Kierkegaard's writings are misogynist, ambivalent, or essentialist in their views of women and the feminine or whether, in some important and vital ways, they are liberatory and empowering for feminists and women trying to free themselves from the maze of patriarchal constructs.</p><p>The essays also show how the three existence-spheres-aesthetic, ethical, and religious-articulated in Kierkegaard's authorship inscribe different modalities of the sexual relation: seduction for the aesthetic, marriage for the ethical, and absence from commerce with the other sex for the religious.</p><p>Contributors are Sylviane Agacinski, Wanda Warren Berry, Birgit Bertung, Jane Duran, Leslie A.

But because Mama couldn't find anyone who thought Avocet was a fine name for a child, she called me Bird. Which is okay by me. She named both her children after birds, her logic being that if we were named for something with wings then maybe we'd be able to fly above the shit in our lives. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So says Bird Jackson, the mesmerizing narrator of Connie May Fowler's vivid and brilliantly written, <b>Before Women Had Wings</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starstruck by a dime-store picture of Jesus, Bird fancies herself ""His girlfriend"" and embarks upon a spiritual quest for salvation, even as the chaos of her home life plunges her into a stony silence. In stark and honest language, she tells the tragic life of her father, a sweet-talking wanna-be country music star, tracks her older sister's perilous journey into womanhood, and witnesses her mother make a courageous and ultimately devastating decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet most profound is Bird's own story—her struggle to sift through the ashes of her parents' lives, her meeting with Miss Zora, a healer whose prayers over the bones of winged creatures are meant to guide their souls to heaven, and her will to make sense of a world where fear is more plentiful than hope, retribution more valued than love. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Through their work with horses, the McCormicks' patients were initiated into the hidden world of animal energy and instinct, and found a safe and natural way to learn about their own dualistic natures. Patients learned to tap into their primal ""animal"" mind and energies and apply them toward more creative and responsible living. What took days or months to uncover in an office setting took onyl minutes when patients were on a horse.<p>You will read case after fascinating case of people discarded by society and the psychiatric community whose lives were turned around by the intuitive guidance and friendship of their equine therapists.<p><b>What People are saying...</b><p>""This book got me.

The authors, both practicing psychotherapists, use horses in their treatment program with mentally disturbed patients, who often bond with their equine companions even when they are unable to relate to other people. The McCormicks explain how horses, quick to sense pretense, force people to rely on their instincts and to be honest with themselves. But riding is only a part of the authors' treatment program. Their clients establish close relationships with the animals by feeding and grooming them, cleaning their stalls and equipment, observing them at work and play, and learning about the long history of humanity's interaction with the horse. The healing process begins when clients learn to relate first to horses and then to their therapists. This is a fascinating book, though its appeal may be limited to those with an interest in psychotherapy or in the therapeutic use of animals.
