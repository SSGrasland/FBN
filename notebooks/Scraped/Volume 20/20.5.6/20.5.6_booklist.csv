<p>In Bite Hard, poet Justin Chin explores his identity as an Asian, a gay man, an artist, and a lover. He rails against both his own life experiences and society's limitations and stereotypes with scathing humor, bare-bones honesty, and unblinking detail. Whether addressing ""what really goes on in the kitchen of Chinese restaurants"" or a series of ex-boyfriends, all named Michael, Chin displays his remarkable emotional range and voice as a poet.</p>
<p>His raw, incantatory, stream-of-consciousness poems confront issues of race, desire, and loss with a compelling urgency that reflects his work as a performance artist, speaking directly to an audience. Throughout this collection, Chin showcases his ability to convey thought-provoking viewpoints on a variety of controversial subjects. As R.

This Perception Of Baldwin Solely As A Black Writer&#151;and Thus One Whose Interest Lies Primarily In The Sociological Or The Documentary&#151;undercuts The Real Importance He Has Had In The Development Of Postwar American Literature. This Month The Library Of America Celebrates Baldwin's Place At The Heart Of American Culture With Two New Volumes Of Baldwin's Most Influential Work.<br> <p>the First Of These Two Volumes, Both Edited By Toni Morrison, Collects Baldwin's Early Fiction, Including The Novels Go Tell It On The Mountain, Giovanni's Room, And Another Country, And The Short Story Collection Going To Meet The Man. The Second Brings Together Nearly All Of His Published Essays, Including Those Published In Such Earlier Volumes As Notes Of A Native Son And The Fire Next Time, As Well As Many Collected Here For The First Time.<br> <p>james Baldwin Was Born In Harlem In 1924, The Stepson Of A Baptist Preacher. He Experienced His Own Conversion At Age 14 And Spent The Next Three Years As A Pentecostal Minister. By The Time He Was 17, However, He'd Been Introduced To The Greenwich Village Art And Music Scenes. Baldwin Left The Church At The End Of His Senior Year In High School, And Began His Life As An Artist.<br> <p>baldwin Is Most Remembered For His Writings On Race, Which Began (as He Says In His Autobiographical Introduction To Notes Of A Native Son) With A Number Of Reviews Of Books On The Negro Problem, Concerning Which The Color Of My Skin Made Me Automatically An Expert. Throughout His Career,however, Baldwin Concerned Himself Less With The Black Experience Per Se Than With The Entire Milieu Of Beliefs And Prejudices That Foster The Painful Relations Experienced Between The Races.<br> <p>but Even From His First Novel, Baldwin Complicated This View Of Race Relations In America With The Equally Thorny Problems Of Sexual Relations. Baldwin, By The Age Of 18, Thought Of Himself As Homosexual; The First, Inarticulate Leanings Of A Young Boy Toward Members Of His Own Sex Can Be Seen In Go Tell It On The Mountain, Published In 1953. Inspired By Baldwin's Own Experience, This Novel Portrays A Young Boy Growing Up In Harlem Who Buries His Conflict With His Parents&#151;and The Inner Conflict Surrounding His Feelings About A Young Preacher At His Church&#151;by Experiencing His Conversion, Finding Himself Saved From His Sins, Both Actual And Potential.<br> <p>giovanni's Room, Published In 1956, Takes Up These Latent Issues Of Sexuality And Masculinity And Makes Them The Central Area Of Exploration. David, The Novel's Narrator, Attempts Throughout The Novel To Account For A Sexuality He Perceives As Aberrant, While Telling The Story Of The Young Man, Giovanni, Whose Life Has Been Destroyed By David's Inability To Deal Honestly With Him.<br> <p>it Is Interesting To Note, However, That In This First Real Exploration Of The Issues Of Sexuality, Baldwin Used White Characters&#151;as Though He Were Equipped, At This Early Point In His Career, To Confront Issues Of Either Racial Or Sexual Prejudice, But Not Both. By The Time Of Another Country, However, Baldwin Has Brought These Two Fields Of Inquiry Together. This Third Novel, Published In 1962, Is Perhaps His Most Complex Evocation Of An Entire Social Milieu, Fraught With Conflicts Over The Battle Lines Of Race And Sex. In It, Rufus Scott, A Promising Young Black Jazz Musician, Is Driven To Suicide After A Disastrous Affair With A Young White Woman Brings All Of His Uncontrollable Anger About The Division Between Black And White Into His Daily Life. The Fallout From His Death, As It Affects Each Person Whose Life He Touched, Creates A Hostile, Unstable World In Which All Such Conflicts Are Dragged Agonizingly To The Surface.<br> <p>in Addition To Being A Novelist, Baldwin Was A Prolific Essayist And Playwright. He Spent Much Of His Life Commuting Between Paris And New York, As Well As Shuttling Between Genres. His Essays Demonstrate His Deep Involvement In Both The Literary And The Political Worlds, Confronting The Same Set Of Interwoven Conflicts As His Novels, But In The Turbulent Social Setting Of Postwar America. Published In 1963, The Fire Next Time Is Perhaps Baldwin's Most Influential Work, A Penetrating Analysis Of The Racial Divide In The United States That Serves As Both A Message Of Hope And A Warning&#58;<br><blockquote>if We&#151;and Now I Mean The Relatively Conscious Whites And The Relatively Conscious Blacks, Who Must, Like Lovers, Insist On, Or Create The Consciousness Of Others&#151;do Not Falter In Our Duty Now, We May Be Able, Handful That We Are, To End The Racial Nightmare, And Achieve Our Country, And Change The History Of The World. If We Do Not Now Dare Everything, The Fulfillment Of That Prophecy, Re-created From The Bible In Song By A Slave, Is Upon Us&#58; God Gave Noah The Rainbow Sign, No More Water, The Fire Next Time.</blockquote> <p>baldwin Died In 1987 Of Esophageal Cancer, But While He Was Among Us, He Spoke Loud And Long About The Many Battle Lines That Divide Our Country. These New Library Of America Editions Are The Ideal Format For That Voice, Which Deserves To Be Preserved, Treasured&#151;and Most Of All, Read.<br></p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>baldwin's Impassioned Essays Have Been At Least As Influential As His Novels In Exposing The Racial Polarization Of American Society. This Massive Compilation Reproduces In Their Entirety His Early Essay Collectionsnotes Of A Native Son (1955), Nobody Knows My Name (1961), The Fire Next Time (1963)as Well As His Later, Less Successful Book-length Essaysthe Pessimistic, Doom-laden No Name In The Street (1972) And The Devil Finds Work (1976), A Semi-autobiographical Gloss On American Movies.

At that time, the storefront in Boston was the nation's first drop-in shelter for women. Today, Rosie's Place occupies several buildings, and its guests receive much more than safe haven. Medical, legal, and educational assistance allow women to walk back out of Rosie's door with the one thing they most desperately need: a future.
<p>Author Andrea Cleghorn takes you inside Rosie's Place to meet women whose lives are in crisis and to meet the individuals who are helping each woman find what she wants and needs. As you experience the perspectives of guests and benefactors, staff and volunteers, you will attend a fund-raising lunch with Lily Tomlin, a longtime supporter of Rosie's Place; you will eat meals and spend the night at Rosie's; you will share Thanksgiving dinner with women who have the most basic reasons to give thanks.</p>
<p>Discover how one woman's stay at Rosie's Place helped give her the strength to overcome a drug addiction, to end an abusive relationship, and to find the confidence to live a life of her own. Meet the owner of a major retailing chain who remembers what it was like to live in poverty and need a helping hand; she now offers internships to Rosie's Place guests. One woman at a time, Rosie's Place offers support to each woman as she moves down the difficult and often frightening road to independence. Some of the women make it, and some of the women cannot.</p>
<p> Cleghorn's insightfully crafted narrative reveals the essence of what makes Rosie's Place an invaluable resource for women who are struggling to find dignity, to create opportunity, and to live meaningful lives.</p>

Her workshops, attended by thousands around the world, teach us to realize our potential for ecstasy as we experience movement and ritual theater techniques. The book is a journey through five universal rhythms-flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical, and stillness. These rhythms can free the body and spirit from ordinary consciousness and catalyze motion deep in the psyche. Each sacred rhythm is a teacher, a gateway to the soul. Flowing holds the feminine mysteries, staccato the masculine. In chaos, the challenge is to integrate these principles into the flow of one's personal energy, to find the magical blend of feminine and masculine energy that makes each person unique. Lyrical is the context of self-realization, the full expression of the soul. And in stillness, the mother of all rhythms, we find the emptiness of the uncluttered mind wherein we contemplate the mystery of it all. Practicing the rhythms frees the body and becomes a way to express the heart and clear the mind. Complete with personal stories and interactive exercises, <i>Sweat Your Prayers</i> reveals an ancient and contemporary method for unleashing a natural sense of movement, resulting in both personal power and presence of the soul.",en,,"Height: 9.26 Inches, Length: 6.34 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/86/9780874778786.jpg,Success,137.0,20.5.6

<p>Although the unique problems of black men are not new, they have been habitually discussed without solid suggestions for change — until now. Psychologist Ernest Johnson, who has been helping black men cope with anger — including his own — for more than a decade, offers hope and answers. He shows how anger can be used — rather than avoided — to build a life filled with love, self-respect, and peace. Exploring the sources of frustration particular to black men today, Dr. Johnson offers prescriptions for managing anger and coping with stress. Changing thought patterns — and actions — begins with learning how to:</p>

Two women, totally unalike in background, personality and social class, are brought together by a shared fascination with the philosophical movement founded by the late Anna Granite (read Ayn Rand). Justine is a chic journalist who wants to write an article about the followers of Granite's philosophy, Definitism. Dorothy is an obese, nocturnal word processor who answers Justine's advertisement in Manhattan Thing and offers to be interviewed about her involvement with the Definitists. As the two women come to know each other, their dismal life experiences gradually emerge, and their present circumstances are seen as a repetition of past connections and betrayals. This is a hard, edgy book, and Gaitskill's energy and flashy intelligence notwithstanding, the perhaps deliberate lack of polish ultimately detracts. The novel's raw, unsparing view is like that of certain contemporary paintings, and there are extraordinary moments of deeply examined female sexuality where Gaitskill is at her most original. But an underdeveloped and fragmented style has not served her well with the narrative and structural demands here. Thus this distinctive novel falls short of its potential.

Provocative and engaging, the vivid physicality of Sherman's photographs is the key to their dramatic power. By exploring the myriad constructions of female identity and the body in our culture, Sherman imitates and confronts assorted representational stereotypes, becoming for many an icon of the contemporary concerns of feminism and postmodernism. Essayists Amanda Cruz, Elizabeth A. T. Smith, and Amelia Jones offer keen insight and observations from several distinct vantage points, demonstrating that Sherman's work is a lens through which to view contemporary art and its ongoing concern with the profound issues of the structures of the self. More than 200 images show the breadth of Sherman's body of work, from the Untitled Film Stills of the 1970s to series such as Centerfolds, Fashion, Disasters, Fairy Tales, and History Portraits, as well as photographs influenced by surrealist artists. Also included are intriguing excerpts from Sherman's notebooks, selections from her contact sheets, and numerous Polaroid studies, all of which shed light on the artist's process. <i>Cindy Sherman: Retrospective</i> was first published to accompany an exhibition organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. 279 photographs, 145 in color.",en,Reprint Edition,"Height: 12.25 Inches, Length: 9.25 Inches, Weight: 3.0423792156 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",49.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/78/9780500279878.jpg,Success,103.0,20.5.6

That diary of a poor black woman from a favela on the outskirts of São Paulo became the best-selling book in Brazilian history. In it, Carolina Maria de Jesus chronicled her life as an unemployed, single parent of three children, eking out a precarious existence selling scrap paper and other detritus found in the city streets. She described how she wrote at night on the scavenged scraps. Her remarkable diary—angry, proud, wretched, and hopeful—was found and published by an enterprising journalist. The book’s success permitted Carolina to leave her flimsy shack in triumph and move into the cinder-block house of her fantasy.&nbsp;<i>I’m Going to Have a Little House</i> is de Jesus’s second diary. It covers the first year following her rise to fame. In it she recounts her struggles with celebrity, middle-class expectations, and the racial and social tensions her success had exacerbated. This work, never previously translated into English, tells the rest of the story—the grim truth that favela life doesn’t prepare one for middle-class ""respectability"" and that the fall back into poverty is as easy as the struggle to escape it is difficult. Carolina Maria de Jesus died in 1977, forgotten and in poverty.

                        <p>""Never before published in English, Carolina's second diary, written in 1960-61, describes her life in the first year after the sudden (and, as it turned out, temporary) fame of Quarto de despejo (see HLAS 25:4741). Translated faithfully into English, evokes the often awkward style adopted by Carolina. Excellent afterword and notes""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.

Martha Hodes Tells A Series Of Stories About Such Liaisons In The Years Before The Civil War, Explores The Complex Ways In Which White Southerners Tolerated Them In The Slave South, And Shows How And Why These Responses Changed With Emancipation. Hodes Provides Details Of The Wedding Of A White Servant-woman And A Slave Man In 1681, On Antebellum Rape Accusation That Uncovered A Relationship Between An Unmarried White Woman And A Slave, And A Divorce Plea From A White Farmer Based On An Adulterous Affair Between His Wife And A Neighborhood Slave. Drawing On Sources That Include Courtroom Testimony, Legislative Petitions, Pardon Pleas, And Congressional Testimony, She Presents The Voices Of The Authorities, Eyewitnesses, And The Transgressors Themselves - And These Voices Seem To Say That In The Slave South, Whites Were Not Overwhelmingly Concerned About Such Liaisons, Beyond The Racial And Legal Status Of The Children That Were Produced. Only With The Advent Of Black Freedom Did The Issue Move Beyond Neighborhood Dramas And Into The Arena Of Politics, Becoming A Much More Serious Taboo Than It Had Ever Been Before. Hodes Gives Vivid Examples Of The Violence That Followed The Upheaval Of War, When Black Men And White Women Were Targeted By The Ku Klux Klan And Unprecedented White Rage And Terrorism Against Such Liaisons Began To Erupt. An Era Of Terror And Lynchings Was Inaugurated, And The Legacy Of These Sexual Politics Lingered Well Into The Twentieth Century.--jacket. 1. Telling The Stories -- 2.

Some Even Argued That The Massacres And Outrages On Both Sides Were Too Horrific To Deserve The Name Of A War. It All Began When Philip (called Metacom By His Own People), The Leader Of The Wampanoag Indians, Led Attacks Against English Towns In The Colony Of Plymouth. The War Spread Quickly, Pitting A Loose Confederation Of Southeastern Algonquians Against A Coalition Of English Colonists. While It Raged, Colonial Armies Pursued Enemy Indians Through The Swamps And Woods Of New England, And Indians Attacked English Farms And Towns From Narragansett Bay To The Connecticut River Valley. Both Sides, In Fact, Had Pursued The War Seemingly Without Restraint, Killing Women And Children, Torturing Captives, And Mutilating The Dead.^ The Fighting Ended After Philip Was Shot, Quartered, And Beheaded In August 1676. The War's Brutality Compelled The Colonists To Defend Themselves Against Accusations That They Had Become Savages. But Jill Lepore Makes Clear That It Was After The War--and Because Of It--that The Boundaries Between Cultures, Hitherto Blurred, Turned Into Rigid Ones. King Philip's War Became One Of The Most Written-about Wars In Our History, And Lepore Argues That The Words Strengthened And Hardened Feelings That, In Turn, Strengthened And Hardened The Enmity Between Indians And Anglos. She Shows How, As Late As The Nineteenth Century, Memories Of The War Were Instrumental In Justifying Indian Removals--and How In Our Own Century That Same War Has Inspired Indian Attempts To Preserve Indianness As Fiercely As The Early Settlers Once Struggled To Preserve Their Englishness.^ Telling The Story Of What May Have Been The Bitterest Of American Conflicts, And Its Reverberations Over The Centuries, Lepore Has Enabled Us To See How The Ways In Which We Remember Past Events Are As Important In Their Effect On Our History As Were The Events Themselves.

<p>An extraordinarily frank, honest, and generous book by one of America's most famous and admired women, <b>Personal History</b> is, as its title suggests, a book composed of both personal memoir and history.</p>
<p>It is the story of Graham's parents: the multimillionaire father who left private business and government service to buy and restore the down-and-out <b>Washington Post</b>, and the formidable, self-absorbed mother who was more interested in her political and charity work, and her passionate friendships with men like Thomas Mann and Adlai Stevenson, than in her children.</p>
<p>It is the story of how <b>The Washington Post</b> struggled to succeed — a fascinating and instructive business history as told from the inside (the paper has been run by Graham herself, her father, her husband, and now her son).</p>
<p>It is the story of Phil Graham — Kay's brilliant, charismatic husband (he clerked for two Supreme Court justices) — whose plunge into manic-depression, betrayal, and eventual suicide is movingly and charitably recounted.</p>
<p>Best of all, it is the story of Kay Graham herself. She was brought up in a family of great wealth, yet she learned and understood nothing about money. She is half-Jewish, yet — incredibly — remained unaware of it for many years.She describes herself as having been naive and awkward, yet intelligent and energetic. She married a man she worshipped, and he fascinated and educated her, and then, in his illness, turned from her and abused her. This destruction of her confidence and happiness is a drama in itself, followed by the even more intense drama of her new life as the head of a great newspaper and a great company, a famous (and even feared) woman in her own right. Hers is a life that came into its own with a vengeance — a success story on every level.</p>
<p>Graham's book is populated with a cast of fascinating characters, from fifty years of presidents (and their wives), to Steichen, Brancusi, Felix Frankfurter, Warren Buffett (her great advisor and protector), Robert McNamara, George Schultz (her regular tennis partner), and, of course, the great names from the <b>Post</b>: Woodward, Bernstein, and Graham's editorpartner, Ben Bradlee. She writes of them, and of the most dramatic moments of her stewardship of the <b>Post</b> (including the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, and the pressmen's strike), with acuity, humor, and good judgment. Her book is about learning by doing, about growing and growing up, about Washington, and about a woman liberated by both circumstance and her own great strengths.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.99 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 1.39 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches",18.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/47/9780375701047.jpg,Success,140.0,20.5.6

Many of the stories assembled here have long been out of print, and others never before collected. These poignant, witty, angry, and deeply poetic stories demonstrate Hughes's uncanny gift for elucidating the most vexing questions of American race relations and human nature in general.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This collection of 47 stories, many previously out-of-print, is a welcome and overdue addition that clearly shows the evolution of Hughes's literary sensibility and craft. Harper, a Spelman College professor, has assembled these stories in order of their publication and has included an appendix of early work, some of which are from Hughes's high-school literary magazine. Largely autobiographical, and set in locations around the world (but most frequently in this country), many of these stories revolve around the same themes: the ultimately demeaning patronage of whites; the challenges of realizing dreams in a world of limited opportunity; and the timeless tensions between the sexes. By turns poignant and indignant, these stories achieve power by revealing small moments that betray more universal truths. In ""Slave on the Block,"" a dilettante white painter doesn't understand the defiance of her model, posing as a slave for sale, who leaves abruptly before the work is complete. ""Professor"" describes the hidden humiliation of a black educator whose imagination sustains him as he endures an evening with wealthy white patrons from whom he is seeking funds for his small college. Stories inspired by Hughes's year aboard a freighter that plied the coast of West Africa are included, as are tales from his most famous collection, The Ways of White Folk. Princeton professor Arnold Rampersand's cogent introduction places the work in context. This is a thoughtfully assembled collection, in which readers can see Hughes mature, moving from idealism and broad sentiment toward a canny, worldly wisdom.

But they have found that batterers tend to fall into one of two categories, which they call ""Pit Bulls"" and ""Cobras."" Pit Bulls, men whose emotions quickly boil over, are driven by deep insecurity and an unhealthy dependence on the mates whom they abuse. Pit Bulls also tend to become stalkers, unable to let go of relationships that have ended. Cobras, on the other hand, are cool and methodical as they inflict pain and humiliation on their spouses or lovers; in one chilling discovery, the authors found that during violent arguments and physical beatings the heart rate of Cobras actually declines. Cobras have often been physically or sexually abused themselves, frequently in childhood, and tend to see violence as an unavoidable part of life. Knowing which type a batterer is can be crucial to gauging whether an abusive relationship is salvageable (Pit Bulls can sometimes be helped through therapy) or whether the situation is beyond repair. Using the stories of several couples in their study, Jacobson and Gottman look at the dynamics of abusive relationships, refuting prevalent myths (""battering often stops on its own"" or ""battered women could stop the battering by changing their own behavior""). Never underestimating the inherent risk or danger involved, the authors discuss how women in their study group prepared themselves to leave an abusive relationship, where a battered woman can get help, and how she can keep herself safe. Written with compassion and insight, When Men Batter Women offers invaluable advice and support to women in abusive relationships, as well as to friends, relative

With sure authenticity, the author evokes the atmosphere of 1854, seven years before the Civil War, and brings to life the vivid cast of characters involved. A local election is pending, from which Glynis and Elizabeth Cady Stanton hope will come gains for women's rights. A wealthy resident has started Seneca Falls's first theater, and its production of Macbeth looms large in the story. Glynis herself faces a wrenching decision: Constable Cullen Stuart wants her as his wife when he moves west to become a Pinkerton man. Warm as her regard for Cullen may be, Glynis is reluctant, knowing how her life must change after marriage. Meanwhile, Seneca Falls has become an important stop on the Underground Railroad. Fugitive slaves following the North Star to Canada find support from many of the town's inhabitants, including Glynis. It is a difficult commitment at best, and when complicated by murder, a perilous one as well. Once again, Miriam Grace Monfredo has combined historical events, a moving personal story, and an engrossing mystery in a work of extraordinary interest.

                        <p>The year is 1854. In Seneca Falls, New York, everyone is busy with the opening of a new theater, no one notices the death of a freed slave. As a supporter of the Underground Railroad, Glynis hears information that raises her suspicions, and soon discovers more than she wants to know about some of the so-called sympathizers.

She never intended them to be published, but the insights they provide into her remarkable life are invaluable.<p>Alcott grew up in a genteel but impoverished household, surrounded by the literary and philosophical elite of nineteenth-century New England, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Like her fictional alter ego, Jo March, she was a free spirit who longed for independence, yet she dutifully supported her parents and three sisters with her literary efforts. In the journals are to be found hints of Alcott's surprisingly complex persona as well as clues to her double life as an author not only of ""high"" literature but also of serial thrillers and Gothic romances.<p>Associate editor Madeleine B. Stern has added an in-depth introduction to <i>The Journals of Louisa May Alcott</i>, the only unabridged edition of Alcott's private diaries.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Prepared by the editors of Alcott's letters and recently discovered thrillers, this volume deepens appreciation for the industrious author. The journals open in 1843, when ``LMA'' was 11, and continue through March 1888, four days before her death at age 56. One grows to feel close to the Alcotts of Concord, Mass.--like the Marches of Little Women , kept poor by the father's visionary schemes. As a girl, Louisa became the chief supporter of her parents and siblings, working at menial jobs, but always writing (and prudently tailoring stories and poems to specific markets). There is no lack of love in the author's references to her dependents, but she sometimes confessed to envying the security that her labor gave them. Alcott's journals offer a literate, poignant, often humorous portrait of a singular woman. Photos not seen by PW.

Its theoretical innovations in the analysis of whiteness are integrated with careful, substantive explorations of whiteness on an international, multiracial, cross-class, and gendered terrain. Contributors localize whiteness, as well as explore its sociological, anthropological, literary, and political dimensions.<br>
Approaching whiteness as a plural rather than singular concept, the essays describe, for instance, African American, Chicana/o, European American, and British experiences of whiteness. The contributors offer critical readings of theory, literature, film and popular culture; ethnographic analyses; explorations of identity formation; and examinations of racism and political process. Essays examine the alarming epidemic of angry white men on both sides of the Atlantic; far-right electoral politics in the UK; underclass white people in Detroit; whiteness in ""brownface"" in the film <i>Gandhi</i>; the engendering of whiteness in Chicana/o movement discourses; ""whiteface"" literature; Roland Barthes as a critic of white consciousness; whiteness in the black imagination; the inclusion and exclusion of suburban ""brown-skinned white girls""; and the slippery relationships between culture, race, and nation in the history of whiteness. <i>Displacing Whiteness</i> breaks new ground by specifying how whiteness is lived, engaged, appropriated, and theorized in a range of geographical locations and historical moments, representing a necessary advance in analytical thinking surrounding the burgeoning study of race and culture.</p>

Hamburger's groundbreaking study of the art of female monasticism explores the place of images and image-making in the spirituality of medieval nuns during the later Middle Ages. Working from a previously unknown group of late-fifteenth-century devotional drawings made by a Benedictine nun for her cloistered companions, Hamburger discusses the distinctive visual culture of female communities. The drawings discovered by Hamburger and the genre to which they belong have never been given serious consideration by art historians, yet they serve as icons of the nuns' religious vocation in all its complexity.<br>
 Setting the drawings and related imagery—manuscript illumination, prints, textiles, and metalwork—within the context of religious life and reform in late medieval Germany, Hamburger reconstructs the artistic, literary, and institutional traditions that shaped the lives of cloistered women.<br>
Hamburger convincingly demonstrates the overwhelming importance of ""seeing"" in devotional practice, challenging traditional assumptions about the primacy of text over image in monastic piety. His presentation of the ""visual culture of the convent"" makes a fundamental contribution to the history of medieval art and, more generally, of late medieval monasticism and spirituality.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 2.40083403318 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches",66.66,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/60/9780520203860.jpg,Success,101.0,20.5.6

Raised in a privileged and protected world of private schools and posh clubs, Margo was a seriously overweight alcoholic with a $1,000 a week cocaine habit when she turned her life around and got clean, sober, and fit. Early in her addictions, she became friends with Jonathan Wright, an accomplished professional photographer and dedicated adventurer and climber who invited Margo to join him on a trek into his beloved Himalayas - a feat Margo knew she was both physically and emotionally incapable of performing. Years later, Jonathan's memory would help sustain her on her quest for a seemingly impossible dream that his life had inspired: to become the first woman in history to scale the highest peak on each of the Earth's seven continents. In 1988, Margo climbed her first two mountains - summiting Mt. Kenya and the awesome, intimidating Mt. Kilimanjaro. An ""ordinary"" middle-aged woman with no formal mountaineering training and no previous experience, she had met and triumphed over the toughest demands and conditions that Nature could provide. But that was just the beginning. Spurred on by her newborn love affair with the world's loftiest peaks and most beautiful and inaccessible places, she pushed herself even further, taking on increasingly greater climbing challenges as she pursued more difficult and dangerous goals under the most harrowing of circumstances. And somewhere along the way - amid magnificent wildernesses of towering pinnacles and breathtaking, ice-covered vistas - Margo Chisholm realized she had reached a summit deep within herself; a place in the heart and soul where she discovered the pride, fulfillment and inner peace she had always longed for.

                        <p>In a story of vast determination, passion, and self-discovery, a woman whose dream is to climb the highest peak on each of the seven continents tells her story through the prism of her own spiritual voyage. 8-page color photo insert. 336 pp. National media publicity.

With stories from his own experience as well as that of other black gays and lesbians, Boykin targets gay racism and black homophobia and suggests that conservative forces have substituted the common language of racism for homophobia in order to prevent a potentially powerful coalition of blacks and gays.</p><p>By portraying what it means to be black and gay, <i>One More River to Cross</i> offers an extraordinary window into a community that challenges this country's acceptance of its minorities, both racial and sexual.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/37/9780385479837.jpg,Success,85.0,20.5.6

Their stories form the heart of this narrative, into which Galland weaves strands of her own searing, personal journey. Re-creations of ancient myths of goddesses from around the world thread through this story of the power of the bond between women. In Nepal, a woman doctor tirelessly rescues children who have been sold to Indian brothels. In India, an international women's campaign works to help clean the waters of the Ganges. In Brazil, a woman teaches street children in a makeshift school under a Rio freeway. In Argentina, the Mothers of the Disappeared bear witness against a government that stole the lives of their children. In the United States, Mother Teresa's Sisters feed the homeless, and a Buddhist nun teaches peacemaking, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Around the world, women are working for healing, and the lives of these women reveal an unusual source of strength: the fierceness of compassion, symbolized in ancient icons, images, and archetypes of the divine feminine. Known to Buddhists in Nepal and Tibet as Tara, to Hindus in India as the goddess Durga, to Catholics in Europe and Latin America as the Black Madonna, and as Jemanja in the Afro-Brazilian tradition of Candomble, this fierce divine feminine arises when the world is on the brink of destruction, and saves us, the ancient stories say. Galland shows us that help comes from forgotten quarters, from what has been lost, rejected, and marginalized, and that though the world may be threatened, it is also being saved, by countless acts of courage, kindness, and fierce compassion.",en,,"Height: 8.56 Inches, Length: 5.94 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.19 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/80/9781573220880.jpg,Success,137.0,20.5.6

This house is a sanctuary for a group of young, homosexual men who meet to do what they can't do openly at home. They chat, flirt, listen to music, and smoke marijuana. Among the group are sex workers and transvestites with high heels, short skirts, heavy make-up, and voluminous hairstyles; and their partners, young, bisexual men, wearing T-shirts and worn jeans, short hair, and maybe a mustache. <br><br>Mema, an AIDS educator and the leader of this gang of homosexual men, invited Annick Prieur, a European sociologist, to meet the community and to conduct her fieldwork at his house. Prieur lived there for six months between 1988 and 1991, and she has kept in touch for more than eight years. As Prieur follows the transvestites in their daily activities&#8212;at their work as prostitutes or as hairdressers, at night having fun in the streets and in discos&#8212;on visits with their families and even in prisons, a fascinating story unfolds of love, violence, and deceit. <br><br>She analyzes the complicated relations between the effeminate homosexuals, most of them transvestites, and their partners, the masculine-looking bisexual men, ultimately asking why these particular gender constructions exist in the Mexican working classes and how they can be so widespread in a male-dominated society&#8212;the very society from which the term <i>machismo</i> stems. Expertly weaving empirical research with theory, Prieur presents new analytical angles on several concepts&#58; family, class, domination, the role of the body,and the production of differences among men.<br><br>A riveting account of heroes and moral dilemmas, community gossip and intrigue, <i>Mema's House, Mexico's City</i> offers a rich story of a hitherto unfamiliar culture and lifestyle.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>The author, an intrepid Norwegian feminist sociologist researching gender construction, here presents a rich resource of interviews with and observations of a small community of transvestites and their hangers-on in one of the many impoverished suburbs of Mexico City. Prieur admits to her initial naivet and confesses that her access to information was sometimes limited by her status as a female foreigner from an ""industrialized"" country. Originally written as a Ph.D. dissertation, her work is methodologically rigorous, effectively describing the complexity of homosexuality in this particular Mexican subculture. From her small pool of interviewees, the author sometimes induces sociological generalities about Mexican male homosexuality and bisexuality that, one fears, border on stereotyping. The study is an extremely valuable contribution but should be read in tandem with Joseph M. Carrier's De los otros: Intimacy and Homosexuality among Mexican Men (Columbia Univ., 1995) and Latin American Male Homosexualities (Univ. of New Mexico, 1995).

Shielded by a lucrative sports industry that fosters the athlete's positive image as role model to the nation's youth, few players are successfully prosecuted in the courts and they rarely face sanctions on their eligibility to play.<br>
<br>
In a work that is sure to generate heated debate, Jeff Benedict thoroughly investigates for the first time athletes' abusive behavior, delving into the full spectrum of complex factors that give rise to and perpetuate the disturbing pattern of frequent sexual and domestic violence toward women.<br>
<br>
Drawing on extensive and unprecedented interviews with athletes, victims, attorneys, coaches, team officials, and others, Benedict provides an in-depth examination of several incidents of rape, gang rape, and assault by successful sports figures, including the cases of Mike Tyson, Christian Peter and other members of the University of Nebraska football team, and former Boston Celtic Marcus Webb. Benedict's probe confronts such controversial issues as race, class, the groupie phenomenon, the sexually permissive lifestyle of many athletes, the consensual sex defense, and the sports industry's indifference to recruiting or drafting talented athletes with prior criminal records.<br>
<br>
Benedict concludes with sound proposals for implementing tougher measures and sanctions at both the college and professional levels in order to stem the disquieting number of athletes who commit violent crimes against women.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",19.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/68/9781555533168.jpg,Success,119.0,20.5.6

Life histories can be a bridge between individual experience and codified knowledge, between human agency and social structure. Life histories can enhance social theory by revealing categories of meaning usually submerged in the conventions of social science. The authors in this volume, all sociologists who have had great impact upon the field in which they write, show how personal relationships, experiences of inequality, and professional conflict and camaraderie interweave with the formation of social theory, political movements, and intellectual thought.

This thrilling, fast-paced survival story chronicles Evans's journey, from her diagnosis of cancer to the agony of treatment to her recovery and the birth of Expedition Inspiration.

Evans draws us into her story, describing in bold emotional detail both the exhilarating and heart-wrenching moments throughout her bout with cancer and while climbing remote and dangerous mountains. She copes with losing her hair, her strength, and nearly her life, but she rarely loses her lively sense of humor.

Hale argues that such a process involves the transformation of culture through the involvement of women in both left-wing and Islamist revolutionary movements. In drawing parallels between the gender ideology of secular and religious organizations in Sudan, Hale analyzes male positioning of women within the culture to serve the movement. Using data from fieldwork conducted between 1961 and 1988, she investigates the conditions under which women’s culture can be active, generative, positive expressions of resistance and transformation. Hale argues that in northern Sudan women may be using Islam to construct their own identity and improve their situation. Nevertheless, she raises questions about the barriers that women may face, now that the Islamic state is achieving hegemony, and discusses the limits of identity politics.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.99869404686 Pounds, Width: 0.71 Inches",53.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/00/9780813333700.jpg,Success,133.0,20.5.6

Along the way, Schulenburg informs our ideas regarding the role of saints in the medieval psyche, gender-specific identification, and the heroics of virginity; a nice added bonus is the mountain of popular information on birth, marriage, families, and death.

<p>""A major new work in Caribbean studies."" - Gay Wilentz, East Carolina University</p>
<p>Colonized and coerced, raped and silenced - this has been the position of Haitian women within their own society, as well as how they have been seen by foreign occupiers. Romanticized symbols of nationhood, they have served, however unwillingly, as a politicized site of contestation between opposing forces.</p>
<p>In this first book-length study in English devoted exclusively to Haitian women's literature, Myriam Chancy finds that Haitian women have their own history, traditions, and stories to tell, tales that they are unwilling to suppress or subordinate to narratives of national autonomy. Issues of race, class, color, caste, nationality, and sexuality are all central to their fiction - as is an urgent sense of the historical place of women between the two U.S. occupations of the country. Their novels interrogate women's social and political stances in Haiti from an explicitly female point of view, forcefully responding to overt sexual and political violence within the nation's ambivalent political climate. Through daring and sensitive readings, simultaneously historical, fictional, and autobiographical, Chancy explores this literature, seeking to uncover answers to the current crisis facing these women today, both within their country and in exile.</p>
<p>The writers surveyed include Anne-christine d'Adesky, Ghislaine Charlier, Marie Chauvet, Jan J. Dominique, Nadine Magloire, and Edwidge Danticat.</p>

<p>In <i>No Fat Chicks,</i> journalist Terry Poulton exposes the real reason so many women spend their lives chasing the mirage of a ""perfect"" body that only 5 percent of us can ever actually achieve: Money. Pulton once became a women's magazine cover story by losing sixty-five pounds in six months, only to regain all the weight. The experience sent her into hiding and led her to have her stomach stapled and to embark on a liquid-protein diet that destroyed her gall bladder. If finallly ended in the realization, compellingly documented in this book, that her lifelong battle with fat -- and with the crippling self-hatred that stayed with her even in her ""thin periods"" -- was fostered by a $50 billion industry devoted to the proposition that a woman is worthles unless she's thin.</p>
<p>Poulton traces the evolution of anti-fat ideology and of the businesses that profit from it. She shows how the glorification of emaciation serves the beauty, fitness, fashion, diet, food, and even the health-care industries, and how the media's vicious vilification of ""fat chicks"" guarantees that women will franticlly keep spending money on products that promise escape from the stigma. And she demonstrates how the cultural pressure to be thin can constrain a woman's life -- economically, sexually, psychologically, emotionally, and physically -- whether she is fat or not.</p>
<p><i>No Fat Chicks</i> also offers new hope to weight-obsessed women, both by revealing how Poulton's own discovery of the diet industry's brainwashing process liberated her from a lifelong prison of shame and by reporting on the encouraging evolutionation of the anti-diet movement.</p>
<p> Passionately argued and meticulously reseached, <i>No Fat Chicks</i> is important, illuminating reading for any women who has ever felt like a failure for being fat.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/34/9781559724234.jpg,Success,115.0,20.5.6

Mary Russell Holmes and her husband, the retired Sherlock Holmes, are enjoying the summer together on their Sussex estate when they are visited by an old friend, Miss Dorothy Ruskin, an archeologist just returned from Palestine. She leaves in their protection an ancient manuscript which seems to hint at the possibility that Mary Magdalene was an apostle&#151;an artifact certain to stir up a storm of biblical proportions in the Christian establishment.

What would the Church say to the possibility of a woman having been a full-fledged apostle? What might the letter do for our understanding of Mary Magdalene?

Once O'neill Left Homefirst To Appear In A Play In Chicago And Then To New York, Where She Lived In A Convent, To Pursue Her Art Studiesshe Took Charge Of Her Life As If She Knew All Along How To Do So.

Her Life Story, As Recounted In An Unfinished Manuscript Left To Relatives When She Died, Is Full Of Wonderful Comments Showing Her Zest For Life And Her Unwillingness To Settle Into Conventional Roles. For Example, In Describing Her Second Husband, Harry Leon Wilson, O'neill Says, We Were Engaged Almost At Once But There Difficulties In Our Rapport. Many Times When We Would Be At A Beach Perhaps For Dinner And A Swim He Would Become Silent, Avert His Eyes And Leave Without Explanation. When I Asked Him Why, He Said: `if You Could Understand, You Wouldn't Have To Ask.' Although Best Known For The Little Cupids (kewpies) She First Drew And Then Designed To Be Molded In Plasticine, O'neill Was Also A Novelist (garda), And Her Friends Tended To Be Other Creative Sorts Of Her Daywitter Bynner, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Kahlil Gibran, Lillian Fiske. O'neill Has A Deceptively Simple Style That Is Well Suited To Conveying Her Feelings And Observations Without Seeming Self-indulgent. The Book Is An Interesting Portrait Of A Woman Whose Accomplishments Would Be Remarkable Today, Let Alone Earlier This Century. Illustrations Not Seen By Pw.

Roediger Has Brought Together Some Of The Most Important Black Writers Throughout History To Explore The Question: What Does It Really Mean To Be White In America? From Folktales And Slave Narratives To Contemporary Essays, Poetry, And Fiction, Black Writers Have Long Been Among America's Keenest Students Of White Consciousness And White Behavior, But Until Now Much Of This Writing Has Been Ignored. Black On White Reverses This Trend By Presenting The Work Of More Than Fifty Major Figures, Including James Baldwin, Derrick Bell, Ralph Ellison, W.e.b.

0-684-84144-4,Because They Wanted to: Stories,"Gaitskill, Mary",Simon & Schuster,256.0,1998-02-27,,Paperback,"<p>Gaitskill's complex, urgent characters struggle with the disparity between what they want and what they know. Longing for emotional connection, they often mistake debasement for passion, manipulation for affection, cruelty for intensity. In ""Tiny, Smiling Daddy,"" a father suffers his ambivalent love for a daughter who has betrayed him - perhaps justly. In ""The Girl on the Plane,"" a disillusioned salesman must face his participation in a brutal act he has almost forgotten. In ""Kiss and Tell,"" a writer seeks revenge on a woman who rejected him, only to find that once he has achieved it, he no longer wants it. In ""The Wrong Thing,"" a lonely, emotionally injured woman involved in a set of skewed, apparently trivial sexual encounters unexpectedly discovers her own life-giving reserve of humility, gentleness, and compassion.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In ""The Dentist,"" a story about a magazine writer's sexual infatuation with her bland, middle-aged dentist, a billboard for Obsession perfume looms over the protagonist's neighborhood, projecting a ""strange arrested sensuality of unsatisfied want."" Like that billboard, the nine stories in Gaitskill's third book (after the novel, Two Girls, Fat and Thin) hold a mirror up to a 30-something zeitgeist of emotional dysfunction, chronicling people paralyzed by unappeasable desires and trapped by abusive families and relationships. The landscape is a familiar one-of support groups and public health clinics, funky neighborhoods in the Pacific Northwest and lower Manhattan inhabited by writers, musicians and sex workers. With her crisp prose and withering eye for detail, Gaitskill invests these scenes with psychological vividness and desolate poignancy. The title story is a portrait of a resilient 16-year-old who runs away from home in the wake of her parent's divorce and takes a job in Vancouver babysitting for a financially desperate mother of three. The disgruntled protagonist of the opening story, ""Tiny, Smiling Daddy,"" disturbed that his estranged lesbian daughter has published a self-help essay about him in a national magazine, ponders the divide between parents and children. In the four-part final story, ""The Wrong Thing,"" a 39-year-old poetry teacher tries to remain stoic in the face of a series of erotic but loveless flings. It's telling that Gaitskill's title is an unfinished sentence, for the theme that binds these stories together is an emotional modality shared by a cast of unhappy people, whose sordid fantasy lives and small gestures of compassion allow them to keep at bay the meaninglessness and despair of the everyday.

Thirty years later, he begins to suspect that he was never meant to survive that accident, and that dark forces are working to rectify that mistake. <P> When Hilton&#39;s wife, the only elected African-American judge in Dade County, FL, begins to receive racist hate mail, he becomes obsessed with protecting his family. Soon, however, he begins to have horrible nightmares, more intense and disturbing than any he has ever experienced. Are the strange dreams trying to tell him something? His sense of reality begins to slip away as he battles both the psychotic threatening to destroy his family and the even more terrifying enemy stalking his sleep. Chilling and utterly convincing, <i>The Between</i> follows the struggles of a man desperately trying to hold on to the people and life he loves, but may have already lost. The compelling plot holds readers in suspense until the final, profound moment of resolution.</p><h3>darkecho.com - A Guran</h3><p>Ms. Due has written a haunting first novel that layers the world that is with worlds that might be. Elements of suspense, Ghanaian folk legend, ghost tales, and a family love story are braided into a suspenseful rope that pulls one readily along. <p> Deftly handling components of an all-too-true-to-life racist psycho, the protagonist's warning and mind-destroying vision-dreams, and a convincing set of characters, the author holds one's attention with a sure style and fast-moving plot. I read its 271 pages straight through in one sitting. <p> In <i>The Between</i>, the reader is clued in almost immediately that Hilton James' brushes with finality as a child were in no way final and that we are dealing with alternatives to the present reality that he must somehow accept in order to save his family. His struggle to understand what is happening to him and to protect his family are compelling.<p> The book's characterization of even minor characters is believeable. For those who would like instruction in how to portray a strong non central female character, the author's DeeDee James is a fine example. The two children in the story are a bit too good to be true, but they still manage to be more realistic than most novelized kids.<p> <i>The Between</i> frightens us because we believe, from the very beginning, that this can and/or did happen.

Preparing to confront the unpredictable twilight of life, Truitt charts her fears and triumphs, joys and sadness, her most poignant memories of the past and clearest visions for the future. In the year of her seventieth birthday, events converge that force Truitt to reevaluate her life. She requests of and receives from her New York gallery a major retrospective of her thirty years of painting and sculpture, thus throwing her work into the public eye. Simultaneously, she is forcibly retired from the tenured position at the University of Maryland, which had granted her professional and financial security. In her introduction Truitt notes, ""writing became in the course of the year a relentless exposure of myself to myself."" Keenly observant, she faces her own vulnerability and draws knowledge and insight from sources as varied as Cicero, the Antarctic explorers, and her own travels in the Canadian wilderness. Preparing for the New York retrospective and successive exhibits, Truitt remembers her inspirations, reflects on the development of her artistic methods and goals, and, above all, considers the meaning of both art and an artist's life. At the same time, she records the delights and tragedies that accompany a family's growth. For Truitt, art and life are inexorably joined, and her narrative sings with the colors and surfaces of her celebrated sculpture.

                        <p>Based on journals written during the year of her seventieth birthday, this new memoir by Anne Truitt, author of Daybook, contains luminous reflections on her life as an artist, mother, grandmother, and teacher. Throughout, Truitt displays a keen and profound interest in people and ideas and an unwavering determination to live a valuable life.

They have served in all capacities, including telegraph operators, architects, yardmasters, welders, nurse/attendants, brakemen, locomotive engineers, and even company president.

In <i>The Bront&amp;eumls: A Life in Letters</i>, the much anticipated follow-up to that landmark biography, Barker uses newly discovered letters and manuscripts, some appearing in print for the first time, to reveal the authentic voices of the three novelist sisters. The letters detail the siblings' self-absorbed childhood, highlighted by wild, imaginative games; the years of struggling to earn a living in uncongenial occupations before they took the literary world by storm; the terrible marring of that success as Branwell, Emily, and Anne died tragically young; the final years as Charlotte, battling against grief, loneliness, and ill health, emerged from anonymity to take her place in literary society. <br>

Gathered from books, journals, diaries, newspapers, and letters spanning three centuries, these fascinating stories highlight the American woman's journey toward identity, independence, and self-creation. They serve to remind us, yet again, that America's faith in an individual's right to the pursuit of happiness has been tested repeatedly by our nation's women. These pages are filled with women like Fanny Fern, the first female newspaper columnist in America, whose early and eloquent review of Whitman's Leaves of Grass stands out as a vivid and prescient testimonial; Ernestine Rose, who fled from an oppressive father in Poland to become one of the first leaders of the American suffragette movement; Sojourner Truth, whose wisdom and insight into the nature of slavery humbles us still; Dorothea Moulton Balano, a seafaring woman whose infectiously exuberant diaries would inspire anyone to go to sea; Luella Day, a practicing physician, who took off for an adventure in the Yukon during the gold rush only to confront the surprising specter of poverty and suffering in the Klondike; and Lynda Van Devanter, an army nurse in Vietnam, whose memories of war offer us a glimpse into the powerful idealism and indomitable will necessary to survive the worst traumas. Whether they are of major or minor importance to the narrative of American history, the many women who come alive in these pages represent a vivid part of our national character and the path of our nation's destiny. Hearts of Fire honors these great women, whose defiance of expectations and conformity was sometimes dangerous, often arduous, and always inspiring.                        <p>The author of Great American Folklore (more than 160,000 copies sold) returns with a collection of hundreds of fascinating stories and legends that celebrate the inner life and outer dynamism of women that illuminate the role of women in American history. 320 pp. National publicity. 12,500 print.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/33/9780609801833.jpg,Success,138.0,20.5.6

Accordingly, instead of being a straightforward chronology of Gilman's life, the book is divided into chapters reflecting her relationships with her parents, closest female friends, two husbands, her neurologist, and finally her daughter.

Thus begins Nora Okja Keller's breathtaking first novel, which follows Beccah, a young Korean-American girl growing up in Hawaii, as she uncovers the secret of her mother's past. Completely ignorant of her mother Akiko's history - she was sold into prostitution in the Japanese ""recreation camps"" of World War II for her oldest sister's dowry - Beccah understands that her mother lives in a spirit world she cannot share, and that clearly marks her as ""other."" Narrated in two voices, Beccah's and Akiko's, Keller reveals the story of Akiko's extraordinary dislocation - the slavery of the camps, the death of her first child, her unhappy marriage to an American missionary - which Beccah understands only after her mother's death. In language that is both harsh and lyrical, Keller explores the universally complicated relationship between mother and daughter. She shows us both Akiko's way of survival, sustained by her remarkable strength and her love for her daughter, and Beccah's acceptance of her mother and her own place in a world her mother no longer physically inhabits.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This impressive first novel by a Hawaii-based writer of mixed Korean and American ancestry depicts one of the atrocities of war and its lingering effects on a later generation. An intense study of a mother-daughter relationship, it dwells simultaneously in the world of spirits and the social milieu of the adolescent schoolgirl who later becomes a career woman with lovers. Beccah is a youngish, contemporary Hawaiian whose Korean mother, Akiko, was sold into prostitution as a young woman and sent to a ""recreation camp'' to service the occupying Japanese army. Akiko developed a resilience that allowed her to distance herself from the daily plundering of her body; she also developed an intense communication with the spirit world that helped her survive the horror of her experience-and helped her, too, to catch the attention of a visiting American missionary, who married her and fathered Beccah. After his death, mother and daughter live together in Honolulu, Beccah striving for a normal life, Akiko, often possessed, screaming and wailing, by her ghosts and visions. With the help of a flamboyant, ultra-worldly friend who calls herself Auntie Reno, Akiko becomes a seer and fortune-teller. Akiko's flashbacks to her haunted past and Beccah's account of their lives together are told alternately, and it is one of Keller's several triumphs that she is able to render the two worlds so powerfully and distinctly. Though piercing and moving in its evocation of feminine closeness, however, the narrative becomes somewhat claustrophobic, so that the occasional interventions of the cheerfully vulgar Auntie Reno are hugely welcome. A striking debut by a strongly gifted writer, nonetheless. Author tour.

Author of novels, memoirs, and travel writings, Maria de las Mercedes Santa Cruz y Montalvo, better known as la Condesa de Merlin (1789-1852), is arguably one of Cuba's most engaging authors; yet until now her works have gone largely ignored.
<p>Born in colonial Havana to an aristocratic Creole family, the future countess of Merlin left Cuba for Spain at an early age. Later, her marriage to the French count Antoine Christophe Merlin and the invasion of French Napoleonic troops precipitated another move to France, where she became one of the belle dames of Paris and began her literary career. She returned only once to Cuba after the death of her husband in 1840, a journey that produced <i>Viaje a la Habana</i>. Upon her return to Paris, Merlin expanded this into <i>La Havane</i>, an ambitious three-volume account of the political, social, and economic organization of the island.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of feminist and psychoanalytical theory, <i>Gender and Nationalism in Colonial Cuba</i> brilliantly explores the many ways in which issues of gender have contributed to Merlin's virtual absence from the canons of literature and from the discourses on Cuban national identity. Merlin's double identity as both Cuban and French is symbolic of the Cuban exiled condition, a fact taken up by contemporary exiled Cuban writers who see the countess as an alter-ego.</p>
<p>Mendez Rodenas seeks to restore Merlin as the first woman writer in Cuban literary history to articulate a sense of national identity, as well as being Cuba's first female historian. She focuses on Merlin's travel writings because they examine such issues as slavery, independence, nationhood, the role of women, education, and local literature. Together her writings construct an alternative, gendered history of nineteenth-century Cuba that must be acknowledged as both functional and authentic.</p>
<p>By situating Merlin at the intersection of the discourses of gender and nationalism, Mendez Rodenas reveals not only her pioneering role but also the need to expand current critical categories to account for the specificity of the Latin American literary tradition. In the process of restoring Merlin to her appropriate place in the canon of Latin American literature, she broadens our understanding of colonial Cuban history and expands our knowledge of the ways in which travel writing can influence a country's national literature .</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.2897042327 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches",30.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/94/9780826512994.jpg,Success,125.0,20.5.6

But this is the first to take the reader, through a mother's eyes, into the day-to-day life of a child with ADD and its dynamics in the home and beyond. Ann Colin's compelling journal recounts her son Willie's first five years of life. Willie is intelligent, creative, affectionate, and amusing. He is also overly excitable and belligerent. We follow Colin and her husband from school to school, doctor to doctor, seeking a correct diagnosis - from an insensitive preschool staff, to the psychologist who pronounces Willie brain-damaged when he walks on tiptoe, to the seesaw of medical opinion on treatment and drugs. It is a marathon that takes them from bewilderment and exhaustion, through coping, to triumph. For a family facing ADD or any other crisis, and for educators and therapists, Willie is an inspiration and a lifesaver.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/88/9780140249088.jpg,Success,136.0,20.5.6

What would it take to ensure that all of us can succeed at getting the job done, the problem solved, and the future more secure?</i> <P>As a student at Yale Law School in 1974, Lani Guinier attended a class with a white male professor who addressed all the students, male and female, as gentlemen. To him the greeting was a form of honorific, evoking the values of traditional legal education. To her it was profoundly alienating.<P>Years later Guinier began a study of female law students with her colleagues, Michelle Fine and Jane Balin, to try to understand the frustrations of women law students in male-dominated schools. Women are now entering law schools in large numbers, but too often many still do not feel welcome. As one says, I used to be very driven, competitive. Then I started to realize that all my effort was getting me nowhere. I just stopped caring. I am scarred forever. <P>After interviewing hundreds of women with similar stories, the authors conclude that conventional one-size-fits-all approaches to legal education discourage many women who could otherwise succeed and, even more, fail to help all students realize their full potential as legal problem-solvers.<P>In <i>Becoming Gentlemen</i> Guinier, Fine, and Balin dare us to question what it means to become qualified, what a fair goal in education might be, and what we can learn from the experience of women law students about teaching and evaluating students in general. Including the authors' original study and two essays and a personal afterword by Lani Guinier, the book challenges us to work toward a more just society, based on ideals of cooperation, the resources of diversity, and the values of teamwork.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Guinier argues here against what she calls one-size-fits-all legal education, which, given the lead author (Guinier is a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Clinton's one-time nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights) and the subject, should be interesting. Unfortunately, this is a lightly padded study conducted by the authors along with law students Ann Bartow and Deborah Lee Stachel. By analyzing the responses of 366 first-, second- and third-year U. of Pennsylvania law students (fairly evenly divided between genders), the authors argue that standardized tests may not identify who will become a good lawyer; that treating all students the same is not necessarily treating them all fairly; and that the present program of standardized tests and Socratic classroom instruction may not be what is best suited to the future needs of the legal profession, which may benefit more from teamwork and cooperation. This last point warranted a stronger argument to bolster the authors' call for less aggressive instruction. The survey results, too, would have been more persuasive had objective observation been added to the students' self-reporting and if the questionnaire had been applied to other law schoolsparticularly since the authors note that the relatively gender-neutral findings of a Stanford survey may be attributable to the distinctive environment of Stanford. The converted may overlook some of these weaknesses, while the skeptical will be made more so by remarks from both students (I really resent feeling like after I am laying out all of this money... I should be forced to participate) and authors (law schools fail to equalize the experience and outcomes for all law students across gender).

This book underscores the importance of including all of the girls' voices into the curriculum where their voices can be nurtured, cultured, and responded to in potentially productive ways.</p><p>Through an exploration of two major writing contexts, the public and the private, Brett Elizabeth Blake chronicles how the girls learned through their writing not only how to name issues salient to them, such as domesticity and racism, but also how to resist the underlying notions of such important issues. The girls' stories are based on nearly three years of study, and the traditional notion of a process approach to writing is challenged by addressing how such an approach must become a site for significant tension and struggle over issues like ownership and voice. Blake suggests several curricular strategies, such as reader response techniques and a violence-prevention unit, as additional approaches that support girls' voices. This book explores and challenges us to look more closely at how the intersection of gender, race, and class is crucial for understanding not only how and what girls write about, but also why they write so deliberately and poignantly about their lives.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.55 Inches, Length: 5.42 Inches, Weight: 0.63052206932 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/02/9780791434802.jpg,Success,45.0,20.5.6

Moved by a lifelong love for the Tao Te Ching, the novelist and poet Ursula K. Le Guin has been working on this version of the text since the 1950s. Scholar J. P. Seaton has added expert linguistic guidance to her work, bringing to it an equally passionate commitment to scholarly accuracy. Together they have created a translation that is unlike any seen before. Le Guin's version captures all the brilliance of Lao Tzu's poetry while conveying with immediacy and clarity the astonishing depth of his spiritual insights. It also corrects many of the distorted views of Lao Tzu's philosophy, freeing it from gender-bias and revealing its universal relevance. This new version is sure to be welcomed by the many readers of the Tao Te Ching, as well as those coming to the text for the first time.

                        <p>""Lao Tzu is lively, concrete, direct, unpredictable, passionate, and exact"" says Ursula K. Le Guin, who has rendered the Chinese sage's 2500-year-old founding text of Taoism in the Tao Te Ching: A Book About the Way and the Power of the Way. Although acclaimed SF author Le Guin reads no Chinese, she worked from an 1898 character-by-character transliteration and translation. Le Guin finds that Tzu's voice remains ""a living voice, and I wanted it to be heard as such."" Readers of her new English language version will surely agree.

Appropriate for African and women's studies courses and a must for college and university libraries. &#151; Choice<P>... Mpho relates the story of her life with an integrity that makes for utterly compelling reading.... The fortitude of this woman, now in her late 60s, is a lesson to us all. &#151; The Bookseller, United Kingdom<P>This is a fascinating autobiography... &#151; KLIATT<P>... a powerful autobiography of a Lesotho elder who tells her life as an African woman in South Africa. The focus on black culture and concerns as much as racism allows for an unusual depth of understanding of black concerns and lifestyles in Africa. &#151; Reviewer's Bookwatch<P>An African woman's poignant and beautifully crafted memoir lyrically portrays the brutal poverty and reliance on ritual that shape the lives of her people, the Basotho.... A commanding and important work that will captivate readers with its unique voice, narrative power, and unforgettable scenes of life in Southern Africa. &#151; Kirkus Reviews<P>... a stunning autobiography of a remarkable woman...

I see that things are always changing. I was born in 1930, so I remember many things which were happening in the old days in Lesotho and which happen no more. I lived in Benoni Location for more than ten years, and I saw the Boer policemen taking black people and beating them like dogs. They even took me once, and kept me in one of their jails for a while. &#151; Mpho 'M'atsepo Nthunya<P>A compelling and unique autobiography by an African woman with little formal education, less privilege, and almost no experience of books or writing. Mpho's is a voice almost never heard in literature or history, a voice from within the struggle of ordinary African women to negotiate a world which incorporates ancient pastoral ways and the congestion, brutality, and racist violence of city life. It is also the voice of a born storyteller who has a subject worthy of her gifts &#151; a story for all the world to hear.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>This implausible memoir is from a woman who experienced extreme adversity, suffering the loss of six children and her husband and then struggling to support her remaining family as a domestic worker. It is the narrative of a woman with a primary education who speaks eight languages and once had a prosperous farm. Nthunya is also a storyteller, relating how her mother was expected to marry someone her father selected for her, thereby collecting a bride-price. But her mother prayed that she would die, only to have her father and husband-to-be pass away instead. Another tale concerns the author's brother-in-law, who put a cruel spell on her and her children after her husband died because she wouldn't allow him to step in as their father, as is the custom. Eventually, three of her sons died, and she blamed her brother-in-law.

Suddenly her body becomes public in a new way: medicine, law, and popular culture all offer her sometimes contradictory ""expert"" advice. Confinements explores the advice offered to pregnant and infertile women by examining assumptions about femininity, class, and the reproductive body that structure the language of expertise. Even advice books written from a specifically countercultural or feminist point of view often attempt to police the way women think about their bodies.</p>
<p>Confinements argues that our perceptions about both pregnancy and infertility are limited by our culture's battles over the meaning of choice and control, arguments over what is natural or unnatural, and the troubled relationship between reproduction and the domestic sphere.

Along with other black men, they are typically portrayed in the media and literature as ""street corner men""—unemployed drifters, absentee fathers, substance abusers. In the larger gay community, they are an invisible minority. One of the Children, the first formal cultural study of gay black men in Harlem, not only illuminates this segment of America's gay population but presents a far richer, more diverse portrait of black men's lives than is commonly perceived. Based on two years' intensive research—during which the author lived in Harlem's gay community—including extensive interviews with fifty-seven community members, this book depicts gay black men's lives in all their social, economic, and cultural complexity. William Hawkeswood takes us from the street into the homes and lives of his subjects. He describes the elaborate network of fris, called ""family,"" that supports these men emotionally and financially, and the community's two-tiered economic structure, comprising gay men and ""boys,"" or hustlers. Hawkeswood also explores what it means for these men to be both gay and black. In the process, he makes the surprising discovery that while the AIDS virus looms all around them, it has not yet significantly affected the community of gay blacks who choose their sexual partners exclusively from among Harlem's other gay black men.",en,,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.14109584768 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",20.55,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/22/9780520202122.jpg,Success,85.0,20.5.6

This book spanning the first fifty years of her life is the account of her extraordinary journey into an understanding of her rich and complex heritage.</p>
<p>TwoTrees's poignant, honest memoir tells of her birth to a Lakota father from a South Dakota reservation and a black mother from an urban neighborhood in Des Moines. She spent summers during her early childhood visiting the Pine Ridge reservation. Her grandmother's teachings from those days sustained her throughout the subsequent years. She always has remembered her grandmother's saying ""You going/coming back being. Grandmothers always singing you going. Grandchildren always singing you coming back. Somebody always singing you.""</p>
<p>After the murder of her mother, she was adopted by her black grandparents, who had worked hard to achieve a middle-class life. TwoTrees was later sent to a Catholic boarding school where she was the only person of color. After she gave birth to a baby girl, whom she released to the care of relatives, she set out on her own. The ensuing journey took her from Chicago to a life in Europe, where she lived for some years as a dancer and a manager of dance companies. Returning to the United States, she lived first in New York, and then in the Southwest, where she spent recent years learning about the landscape and the indigenous cultures and giving workshops and performances.</p>
<p>TwoTrees, whose fascinating life journey has been filled with exhilarating as well as painful moments, writes movingly of her efforts to incorporate the diverse strands of her identity. Always carrying with her the love and lessons from her Indian grandmother and many others, she has come to understand the value of her multiple heritages.</p>

By today's standards, Rousseau's sexual politics appear reactionary, paternalistic, even blatantly misogynist; yet, among his female contemporaries, his works often met with enthusiastic approval and had tremendous impact on their values and behavior. To probe Rousseau's paradoxical appeal to eighteenth-century readers, Mary Trouille examines how seven women authors responded to his writings and sexual politics and traces his influence on their lives and works.

<br>
Making the Gods Work for You presents internationally renowned author Caroline W. Casey's remarkable doctrine of Visionary Activist Astrology. In this reverently irreverent mystery school disguised as a book (in which each of the planetary gods is a professor), we are invited to think of our lives as a spiritual detective novel. For example, Venus teaches us that our affinities and quirks are clues to our unique mission and contribution to the world. The astrological language of the psyche is a tool for deciphering and revitalizing this sense of mission. Casey teaches you how to expand your range of intimacy with the ten parts of yourself represented by the planets, here called gods. You will learn how to use this language to reverence and feed the forces of your psyche that connect you to very real external forces. This book intends to catalyze a movement to engage the imagination of all people with a sense of humor and a desire to do collaborative good in the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding on the ideas first presented in her popular audiotape series, Inner and Outer Space, Casey explores the archetypes at the heart of human relationships, aspirations, and spiritual quests. In an engaging narrative enlivened by stories, fables, exercises, and meditations developed through her work as an astrological counselor, she provides a practical system of personal and collective liberation. Making the Gods Work for You provides us with innovative principles to live by and rituals inviting us to become active, dynamic participants in the dance of life. We can then become increasingly conscious players on theteam of creation, capable of sharing our gifts with the world at this crucial historical time.",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",3.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/80/9780609600580.jpg,Success,139.0,20.5.6

0-8223-2044-4,Beyond The Whiteness of Whiteness: Memoir of a White Mother of Black Sons,"Lazarre, Jane",Duke University Press Books,168.0,1997-08-13,,Paperback,"<p>“I am Black,” Jane Lazarre’s son tells her. “I have a Jewish mother, but I am not ‘biracial.’ That term is meaningless to me.” She understands, she says—but he tells her, gently, that he doesn’t think so, that she can’t understand this completely because she is white. <i>Beyond the Whiteness of Whiteness</i> is Jane Lazarre’s memoir of coming to terms with this painful truth, of learning to look into the nature of whiteness in a way that passionately informs the connections between herself and her family. A moving account of life in a biracial family, this book is a powerful meditation on motherhood and racism in America, the story of an education into the realities of African American culture.<br>
Lazarre has spent over twenty-five years living in a Black American family, married to an African American man, birthing and raising two sons. A teacher of African American literature, she has been influenced by an autobiographical tradition that is characterized by a speaking out against racism and a grounding of that expression in one’s own experience—an overlapping of the stories of one’s own life and the world. Like the stories of that tradition, Lazarre’s is a recovery of memories that come together in this book with a new sense of meaning. From a crucial moment in which consciousness is transformed, to recalling and accepting the nature and realities of whiteness, each step describes an aspect of her internal and intellectual journey. Recalling events that opened her eyes to her sons’ and husband’s experience as Black Americans—an operation, turned into a horrific nightmare by a doctor’s unconscious racism or the jarring truths brought home by a visit to an exhibit on slavery at the Richmond Museum of the Confederacy—or her own revealing missteps, Lazarre describes a movement from silence to voice, to a commitment to action, and to an appreciation of the value of a fluid, even ambiguous, identity. It is a coming of age that permits a final retelling of family history and family reunion.<br>
With her skill as a novelist and her experience as a teacher, Jane Lazarre has crafted a narrative as compelling as it is telling. It eloquently describes the author’s delight at being accepted into her husband’s family and attests to the power of motherhood. And as personal as this story is, it is a remarkably incisive account of how perceptions of racial difference lie at the heart of the history and culture of America.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",27.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/49/9780822320449.jpg,Success,52.0,20.5.6

Focusing On The Battle In Missouri, Which Mirrors The Deepening Abortion Conflicts Around The Country As American States First Begin Changing Their Century-old Criminal Abortion Laws.

Wade To Set Up Almost Singlehandedly The First Legal Abortion Clinic In Missouri. Samuel Lee Is A Young Pacifist And Would-be Seminarian Who Arrives In St. Louis To Begin His Formal Religious Studies And Finds Himself Instead Drawn To The More Compelling And Immediated Work Of The Right-to-life Movement.

Author Ashton Applewhite is one of these women, having sued for divorce after enduring an unfulfilling ten-year marriage. <i>Cutting Loose</i> is a wonderfully appealing book for women who want to leave their marriage but fear the consequences. <P>Shattering the media-generated image of the lonely, deprived and financially strapped divorcee, Applewhite provides a much needed reality check. <i>Cutting Loose</i> introduces 50 women, varying in age, race, class and predicament, who have thrived after initiating their own divorces. Their fears of financial, emotional and romantic ruin were never realized; on the contrary, their lives improved immeasurably, and their self-esteem soared. <P><i>Cutting Loose</i> also answers the crucial questions&#58; How do you finally decide to make the big break? What is getting divorced really like? What are the shortcomings of the legal process? What about custody and child support? financial and emotional survival? and how does a woman's self-image change during and after divorce?</p> <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3> <p>A divorc&eacute;e enthusiastically explains why shedding one's husband can be the smartest, healthiest move an unhappily married woman can make.<P>Applewhite, a freelance editor and writer, presents a composite portrait of today's strong and resourceful divorced woman, compiled through interviews with nearly 50 women of all ages, incomes, and backgrounds who initiated their divorces. As depicted here, marriage is too often an oppressive arrangement for women, one they can well do without. If Applewhite's figures are correct, three-fourths of today's divorces are initiated by women, and if her analysis of the situation is correct, they are better off, at least psychologically, for having taken the big step. Despite the financial hardship experienced by the women, especially those with dependent children, none regretted having gotten a divorce; indeed, some expressed regret at not having done it sooner. An admittedly unscientific sampling of women&#151;Applewhite appealed for interviewees in The Pennysaver, Romance Writers Report, and other publictions&#151;these confident women eagerly share their experiences of coming to the decision, going through the legal process, coping with the financial consequences, regaining their independence, and parenting and step-parenting. While Applewhite declares that this is not a how-to manual, she offers plenty of practical advice on finding a lawyer, protecting oneself and getting one's money's worth, using a mediator, and the basics of custody arrangements and child support. More significant, though, for any woman contemplating a divorce, is the hearty you-too-can-do-it encouragement that permeates the text.<P> An empowering and comforting message for unhappily married women, but one whose validity is open to debate.<P></p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.51147244784 Pounds, Width: 0.756757 Inches",14.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/89/9780060928889.jpg,Success,132.0,20.5.6

This question is at the heart of Katya Gibel Azoulay’s <i>Black, Jewish, and Interracial</i>. Motivated by her own experience as the child of a Jewish mother and Jamaican father, Gibel Azoulay blends historical, theoretical, and personal perspectives to explore the possibilities and meanings that arise when Black and Jewish identities merge. As she asks what it means to be Black, Jewish, and interracial, Gibel Azoulay challenges deeply ingrained assumptions about identity and moves toward a consideration of complementary racial identities.<br>
Beginning with an examination of the concept of identity as it figures in philosophical and political thought, Gibel Azoulay moves on to consider and compare the politics and traditions of the Black and Jewish experience in America. Her inquiry draws together such diverse subjects as <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>, the Leo Frank case, ""passing,"" intermarriage, civil rights, and anti-Semitism. The paradoxical presence of being both Black and Jewish, she argues, leads questions of identity, identity politics, and diversity in a new direction as it challenges distinct notions of whiteness and blackness. Rising above familiar notions of identity crisis and cultural confrontation, she offers new insights into the discourse of race and multiculturalism as she suggests that identity can be a more encompassing concept than is usually thought. Gibel Azoulay adds her own personal history and interviews with eight other Black and Jewish individuals to reveal various ways in which interracial identities are being lived, experienced, and understood in contemporary America.</p>",en,,"Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches",25.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/19/9780822319719.jpg,Success,54.0,20.5.6

Approximately 150,000 Individuals Now Serve On Two-year Contracts, And The Vast Majority Are Women From The Philippines. Nicole Constable Tells Their Story. Interweaving Her Analysis With Anecdotal Evidence Collected In Interviews With Individual Domestic Workers, She Shows How Power Is Expressed In The Day-to-day Lives Of Filipina Domestic Workers. Filipina Guest Workers Flooding Into Hong Kong Are Implicitly Compared To Chinese Domestic Workers And Found Wanting. Local, Cultural, And Historical Factors Influence Their Treatment, As Do Preconceptions About Gender, Ethnicity, And Class. Constable Explains How Domestic Workers Are Controlled And Disciplined By Employment Agencies, By Employers Themselves, And By State Policies Such As The Rule Against Working For More Than One Employer. The Forms Of Discipline Range From Physical Abuse To Intrusive Regulations Including Restrictions On Hair Length And The Prohibition Of Lipstick. Filipina Workers Resist Oppression Through Legal Action And Political Protests, Through Their Use Of Household Or Public Space, And Through Less Confrontational Means Such As Jokes And Pranks. Some Find Real Satisfaction In Their Work, Constable Says, And She Warns Against Any Simplistic Characterization Of Domestic Workers As Either Empowered Or Oppressed, Class-conscious Or Unaware.
