RAPE & MY JOURNEY BACK
Nancy Venable Raine's searing and luminous account of her rape and its aftermath
is a stunning literary achievement. “This is the most important book ever written
about rape. It breaks new ground in personalizing and contextualizing the after-
shock of trauma. I am deeply grateful that Nancy Venable Raine has chosen to
break her silence about this still fraught and dangerous topic."" Louise DeSalvo,

SLAYING THE MERMAID
WOMEN AND THE CULTURE OF SACRIFICE
In Slaying the Mermaid, Stephanie Golden reveals with eye-opening clarity the his-
torical, cultural, social, and even mythic reasons why women feel such an obliga-
tion to put the needs of others first—even against their will and contrary to their
principles—because they cannot face the pain they would feel if they did not.
Drawing on extensive research and interviews with experts and a diverse array of
women, and united by the image of the Little Mermaid, the fabled ideal of the
N . self-sacrificing woman, Slaying the Mermaid will help women become conscious of
O | the self-defeating behavior they've been blind to and reclaim their energy,
creativity, and identity.
