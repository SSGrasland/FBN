Puerto Rican immigrants, the family suffered through periods of poverty exemplified by the author's trips to the welfare office with Mami, where she translated her mother's Spanish so that they could obtain benefits. Santiago's good humor, zest for life and fighting spirit permeate her chronicle and moderate the impact of the hard times she describes. She studied acting at the prestigious Performing Arts Public High School and, despite feeling out of place because of her heritage, Santiago was able to obtain work in a children's theater and had a small role in the film Up the Down Staircase. Mami prevented her from dating until she was 17, but Santiago details several romantic involvements, including an affair with a Turkish filmmaker. Forced to lose her Puerto Rican accent to widen her acting range, Santiago never lost her connection to Mami, her family and her heritage, and her love for them all shines through this engaging memoir.

Koller, and their seventeen- year property dispute against the nation's leading cement corporation-the Atlas Portland Cement Company.</p><p>In 1903, Atlas built a plant on the border of the small community of Ilasco, located just outside Hannibal-home of the infamous cave popularized in Mark Twain's most acclaimed novels. The rich and powerful Atlas quickly appointed itself as caretaker of Twain's heritage and sought to take control of Ilasco. However, its authority was challenged in 1910 when Heinbach inherited her husband's tract of land that formed much of the unincorporated town site. On grounds that Heinbach's husband had been in the advanced stages of alcoholism when she married him the year before, some of Ilasco's political leaders and others who had ties to Atlas challenged the will, charging Heinbach with undue influence.</p><p>To help fight against the local lawyers and politicians who wanted Atlas to own the land, Heinbach enlisted the help of her shrewd and combative sister, Euphemia Koller, by making her co-owner of the tract. In a complex case that went to the Missouri Supreme Court four times, the sisters fiercely sought to hang on to the tract. However, in 1921 the county probate court imposed a guardianship over Heinbach and a circuit judge ordered a sheriff's sale of the property. After Atlas purchased the tract, Koller waged a lonely battle to overturn the sale and expose the political conspiracies that had led to Ilasco's conversion into a company town. Her efforts ultimately resulted in her court- ordered confinement in 1927 to Missouri's State Hospital Number One for the Insane, where she remained until her death at age sixty-eight.</p><p><i>Insane Sisters</i> traces the dire consequences the sisters suffered and provides a fascinating look at how the intersection of gender, class, and law shaped the history and politics of Ilasco. The book also sheds valuable new light on the wider consolidation of corporate capitalism and the use of guardianships and insanity to punish unconventional women in the early twentieth century.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.32718281724 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/05/9780826212405.jpg,Success,128,22.3.4

At thirteen, Negi yearns for her own bed, for privacy, and her father, who remains in Puerto Rico. Translating for Mami at the welfare office in the morning, starring as Cleopatra at New York's Performing Arts High School in the afternoon, and dancing salsa all night, she also seeks to find balance between being an American and Puerto Rican. When Negi defies her mother by going on a series of dates, she finds that independence brings challenges.<P>At once a universally poignant coming-of-age tale and a heartfelt immigrant's story, <b>Almost a Woman</b> is Santiago's triumphant journey into womanhood.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>This sequel to the story of Santiago's childhood (When I Was Puerto Rican) covers her life as an adolescent and young woman when she lived in Brooklyn, New York, with her mother (Mami) and 10 siblings during the 1960s. Puerto Rican immigrants, the family suffered through periods of poverty exemplified by the author's trips to the welfare office with Mami, where she translated her mother's Spanish so that they could obtain benefits. Santiago's good humor, zest for life and fighting spirit permeate her chronicle and moderate the impact of the hard times she describes. She studied acting at the prestigious Performing Arts Public High School and, despite feeling out of place because of her heritage, Santiago was able to obtain work in a children's theater and had a small role in the film Up the Down Staircase. Mami prevented her from dating until she was 17, but Santiago details several romantic involvements, including an affair with a Turkish filmmaker. Forced to lose her Puerto Rican accent to widen her acting range, Santiago never lost her connection to Mami, her family and her heritage, and her love for them all shines through this engaging memoir.

0-465-09129-6,Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria?: And Other Conversations About Race,"Tatum, Beverly Daniels",Basic Books,304,6/24/1999,,Paperback,"<p>Walk into any racially mixed high school and you will see Black youth seated together in the cafeteria. Of course, it’s not just the Black kids sitting together—the White, Latino, Asian Pacific, and in some regions, American Indian youth, are clustered in their own groups, too. The same phenomenon can be observed in college dining halls, faculty lounges, and in corporate cafeterias.What is going on here? Is this self-segregation a problem we should try to fix, or a coping strategy we should support? How can we get past our reluctance to talk about racial issues to even discuss it? And what about the other questions we and our children have about race?Beverly Daniel Tatum is a renowned authority on the psychology of racism. She asserts that we do not know how to talk about our racial differences: Whites are afraid of using the wrong words and being perceived as “racist.” Parents of color are afraid of exposing their children to painful racial realities too soon. Tatum understands that the vocabulary of race is loaded and that embarrassment and awkwardness often stymie conversations about this subject; yet, she believes that these obstacles can and must be overcome if we are to bring about change.In <i>“Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?” And Other Conversations About Race,</i> Dr. Tatum provides us with a new way of thinking and talking about race through the lens of racial identity. She explains that all of us have a racial identity and must strive to affirm it. For people of color, the development of a constructive racial identity requires being able to recognize and reject the bombardment of negative stereotypes and to embrace a history of resistance and empowerment rather than passive victimization. For Whites, the challenge is to engage in a process of racial identity development which leads to an awareness of White privilege and a determination to actively work against injustice—and this requires the strength to reject a system that awards them, and to reclaim the legacy of White allies. For many, this is uncharted territory. This book provides a road map for those who want to make the journey and better understand the racial dynamics of their daily lives.Tatum extends her ideas about racial identity development beyond the usual Black-White paradigm to embrace the unique circumstances of Latinos, American Indians, Asians, as well as biracial youth. Also included is a list of resources for further reading as well as a list of books for parents and teachers to recommend to children of all ages.Using real-life examples and the latest research, Tatum presents strong evidence that straight talk about our racial identities—whatever they may be—is essential if we are serious about facilitating communication across racial and ethnic divides. We have waited far too long to begin our conversations about race. This remarkable book, infused with great wisdom and humanity, tells us where to start.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",14,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/94/9780465091294.jpg,Success,150,22.3.4

It covers a long history and a dynamic and ever changing present, while opening up the academic profession to new scholarship and new ways of thinking.<br><br><b>A groundbreaking new approach</b><br>While gays and lesbians have shared many aspects of life, their histories and cultures developed in profoundly different ways. To reflect this crucial fact, the encyclopedia has been prepared in two separate volumes assuring that both histories receive full, unbiased attention and that a broad range of human experience is covered.<br><br><b>Written for and by a wide range of people </b><br>Intended as a reference for students and scholarsin all fields, as well as for the general public, the encyclopedia is written in user-friendly language. At the same time it maintains a high level of scholarship that incorporates both passion and objectivity. It is written by some of the most famous names in the field, as well as new scholars, whose research continues to advance gender studies into the future.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Zimmerman (women's studies, San Diego State Univ.) and Haggerty (English, Univ. of California, Riverside) have compiled two impressive volumes on gay and lesbian history and culture. The signed articles range from half a page to about six pages and provide at least a minimal bibliography and cross references. There are entries on narrow topics that one would expect, such as Stonewall and Daughters of Bilitis, as well as biographies of both historical and contemporary figures. Unexpected broader topics, such as gentrification and social work, are also featured because they have played a role in gay or lesbian culture and history. Some people and events are hidden within these broader articles, but each volume has a lengthy index. The earlier Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, edited by Wayne Dynes (LJ 1/90), was criticized for not addressing lesbian history adequately, and Zimmerman and Haggerty state that they chose to produce two separate volumes to ensure that both histories receive full and unbiased attention. Users, however, would have been better served by a single alphabetical arrangement or, at least, a shared index. One who knows nothing about the Mattachine Society, for example, would be forced to check both volumes before finding the relevant information. The editors acknowledge making different choices about content and emphasis, and there is some inconsistency. Thus, there is an entry for contemporary mystery writer Michael Nava but none for Sandra Scoppettone or Katherine Forrest. Overall, however, these are fine scholarly works that belong in the reference section of every library.--Debra Moore, Loyola Marymount Univ., Los Angeles Copyright 2000 Cahners BusinessInformation.</p>",en,ILLUSTRATE,"Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 4.5635688234 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",259.06,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/04/9780815318804.jpg,Success,113,22.3.4

It rediscovers Virginia Woolf afresh.&quot;&#160;&#160;<br>&#151;<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>While Virginia Woolf&#151;one of our century's most brilliant and mercurial writers&#151;has had no shortage of biographers, none has seemed as naturally suited to the task as Hermione Lee. Subscribing to Virginia Woolf's own belief in the fluidity and elusiveness of identity, Lee comes at her subject from a multitude of perspectives, producing a richly layered portrait of the writer and the woman that leaves all of her complexities and contradictions intact.&#160;&#160;Such issues as sexual abuse, mental illness, and suicide are brought into balance with the immensity of her literary achievement, her heroic commitment to her work, her generosity and wit,&#160;&#160;and her sanity and strength. <P>It is not often that biography offers the satisfactions of great fiction&#151;but this is clearly what Hermione Lee has achieved. Accessible, intelligent, and deeply pleasurable to read, her Virginia Woolf will undoubtedly take its place as the standard biography for years to come.<P>&quot;One of the most impressive biographies of the decade&#58; moving, eloquent, powerful as both literary and social history.&quot;&#160;&#160;<br>&#151;<i>Financial Times</i><P>&quot;The most distinguished study of Woolf yet.&quot;&#160;&#160;&#151;<i>The New Republic</i></p> <h3>Elizabeth Judd</h3> <p><P>My college roommates and I sometimes argued about which of us looked or acted most like Virginia Woolf. We rarely discussed her novels. Hermione Lee has written the latest Woolf biography for people like me -- fans of the Virginia Woolf legend who are less intrigued by her prose. Nothing short of a biographer's dream, Woolf is famous for her feminism, friendships with Bloomsbury artists, romantic relationships with women, recurring bouts of madness, childhood sexual abuse and suicide, and Lee delivers the goods in this absorbing and well-researched book. <P>If you're not well acquainted with Woolf's history, however, this biography is not for you. Lee -- annoyingly -- assumes familiarity with Woolf's life, casually dropping names and mentioning family incidents without explanation. (For example, she refers to the Dreadnought Hoax several times but waits until page 278 to relate the incident in which Woolf and friends dressed up as Abyssinians, tricking the British Navy into taking them aboard a warship.) The book's structure will be another obstacle for newcomers; Lee organizes chapters around themes like ""Abuses"" or ""Party-Going,"" rather than telling Woolf's story chronologically. Adding to the confusion, Lee writes as if Woolf's novels are common knowledge, and neither summarizes the plots nor explains the novelist's contribution to modernism. <P>On the other hand, Lee adopts the perfect tone for Woolf aficionados: bracing, forthright, even confiding. Having sifted through volumes of correspondence, reminiscences and sometimes conflicting information, Lee debunks the wilder speculations about Woolf and draws reasonable conclusions about long-standing controversies. For instance, she re-examines the myth that Woolf's marriage was loveless by citing diary passages of true affection; after 25 years of marriage, Woolf wrote, ""You see, it is an enormous pleasure, being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete."" Similarly, Lee tempers Woolf's reputation for mean-spirited gossip by citing examples of her extraordinary kindness. And she balances Virginia's reputation as a depressive with anecdotes about her mischievousness and light-hearted friendships. <P>By calling into question the prevailing images of Woolf as madwoman, daffy genius or elitist snob, Lee paints the writer as far more nuanced than such distorted myths suggest. Even Lee's explanation of Woolf's enduring appeal is characteristically complex. She quotes Woolf on Shelley: ""There are some stories which have to be retold by each generation, not that we have anything new to add to them, but because of some queer quality in them which makes them not only Shelley's story but our own."" I'd simply add that Woolf's story is delicious enough to deserve one more retelling. -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,Vintage Books ed.,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 1.6875 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",15.05,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/68/9780375701368.jpg,Success,154,22.3.4

Others insisted that Jones could not have been harassed because the president did not punish her for refusing him. During the impeachment debate, many feminists defended the president on the grounds that his alleged lies in the Jones case were ""just about sex"" and therefore insignificant. In the most publicized sexual harassment case to date, longtime proponents of sexual harassment law raised the political and legal thresholds for taking sexual harassment seriously.In a passionate defense of the rights of sexually harassed women, Gwendolyn Mink warns that the president's supporters have undermined our sexual harassment laws. Hostile Environment is her provocative account of the harm being done to these laws and her warning that the laws themselves are worthless if few women dare to use them.Correcting many common misapprehensions, Mink explains sexual harassment as a legal concept and charts its judicial and legislative history. She shows the many important contributions feminists have made to the development of sexual harassment law. She also, however, develops a stringent critique of feminist responses to the president's lies in the Jones case. Sometimes scathing, Hostile Environment provides a fresh perspective on the recent politics of sexual harassment. It also provides a highly personal perspective.

0-8147-5812-6,Eve: A Biography,"Norris, Pamela",NYU Press,496,9/1/1999,,Hardcover,"<p><p><b>Eve&#58; A Biography</b> is the history of Everywoman. Her brief adventure in the Book of Genesis is where the Western idea of woman began, and three thousand years after Eve offered Adam the forbidden fruit, everyone still knows that losing Paradise was Eve's fault.<p> <p>Pamela Norris traces the evolution of Eve's bad reputation, drawing on a rich and diverse tradition of storytelling that embraces myth, folk tale and popular romance, and puts the spotlight firmly on women and their sexuality. From Dinah and Delilah, Pandora and Psyche, to the snaky Lamias and Liliths who haunted nineteenth-century painting and literature, centuries of disobedient women have been linked with Eve, the original bad girl, providing ample ammunition for male fears and fantasies. But Eve's story has also been retold by women, who have found ingenious and often subversive ways to free her from her disreputable past.<p> <p>Stimulating, intriguing and wittily erudite, <b>Eve&#58; A Biography </b>is the entrancing tale of a folk maiden who metamorphoses into a vamp, a mermaid, a bluestocking, a witch, a virgin trapped inside the walls of a fertile garden and finally, perhaps, into a thoroughly modern woman who chews the apple of knowledge with gusto and wouldn't dream of offering Adam a bite.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>According to Norris, the history of sexism can be illuminated through the evolving interpretation of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Beginning her comparative study with ancient Greek myths, she equates Eve with Pandora, whose curiosity brought evil into the world. Classical writers considered women to be troublemakers: Aristotle was noted for his ""scientific"" theory that the female was an imperfect male. Norris cites chapter and verse from Old and New Testament and apocryphal writings, medieval works and those of more recent writers ranging from Charlotte Bront to Anita Brookner. Twelve color plates of works by such masters as Piero della Francesca and Hieronymus Bosch represent the traditional view of Eve as a seductive beauty tempting Adam to sin. According to Genesis, Eve's punishment was the pain of childbirth and eternal submission to her husband, who is also condemned to labor for his bread. Both were cast out of the Garden of Eden, losing the gift of eternal life. While the early Christian church fathers regarded Eve as ""the Devil's gateway"" and ""the first deserter of the divine law,"" other commentators have given the story a more favorable reading. The fall was a felix culpa (""happy fault""), when the two, led by Eve, first took responsibility for their destiny. Writers continue to be fascinated by Eve, but, Norris warns, the myth of Eve ""was developed to manipulate and control women rather than to console them."" Erudite but eminently accessible, Norris's account of how religious beliefs and cultural forces have affected prevailing views of women is an important addition to the literature of women's studies.

Stocking a wide range of quality fiction and nonfiction, Books &amp; Co. was the kind of bookstore writers and readers dream about: a place where reading was an adventure, where interesting works would always be available, where writers would congregate to share ideas and discuss their writing. Its closing, in a rent dispute with the Whitney Museum of Art, caused a media sensation as readers and book lovers decried the end of a cultural icon. In Bookstore, Lynne Tillman tells the story of this legendary store and its determined founder, Jeannette Watson, with help from the voices of Brendan Gill, Roy Blount Jr., Fran Lebowitz, Calvin Trillin, Susan Sontag, Paul Auster, Simon Schama, Lyn Chase, Susan Cheever, Leila Hadley, J.D. McClatchy, Richard Howard, and many more. And the story goes beyond the walls of the store itself to explore the state of publishing and bookselling in a time when the very landscape of the book world has shifted radically.

Yet such research is only slowly reaching a wide audience beyond the academy. Seven years in the making, centuries overdue, Women in Scripture is the groundbreaking work that will finally open this field to readers of all backgrounds—Jews, Christians, and everyone fascinated by a body of literature that has exerted a singular influence on Western civilization.<br>
 The editors have taken on the ambitious task of identifying every woman and group of women mentioned in the Bible, whether named or unnamed, well known or heretofore not known at all. The result is more than eight hundred articles, written by the finest scholars in the field, that examine the numerous women who have often been obscured by the androcentric nature of the biblical record and by centuries of translation and interpretation that have paid little or no attention to them. At last, Women in Scripture gives these women their due.<br>
 They are remarkably varied—from prophets to prostitutes, military heroines to musicians, deacons to dancers, widows to wet nurses, rulers to slaves. There are familiar faces, such as Eve, Judith, and Mary, seen anew with the full benefit of the most up-to-date results of biblical scholarship. But the most innovative aspect of this book is the section devoted to the many women who in the scriptures do not even have names.<br>
 Both in scope and accessibility, Women in Scripture is an exceptional work. Combining rigorous scholarship with engaging prose, each of these articles on women in the Hebrew Bible, the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books, and the New Testament will inform, delight, and challenge readers interested in the Bible, scholars and laypeople alike. Together, these articles create a volume that takes the study of women in the Bible to a new level.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 2.8 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",40,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/68/9780395709368.jpg,Success,143,22.3.4

Today her company, Mothers Work--which includes the retail outlets Mimi Maternity, Motherhood, and A Pea in the Pod--has grown to become a multimillion-dollar maternity clothing empire.<br>
<br>
Written with a refreshingly candid, can-do attitude, <b>MothersWork</b> describes how Matthias got her company off the ground--offering specific lessons for other entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs on the nuts and bolts of building and growing your dream. The first step, of course, is fastening on what it is you plan to sell.<br>
<br>
As Matthias searched for an idea for a new company--around the time of her first pregnancy--she was discovering how impossible it was to find maternity clothes suitable for the office. Realizing that other professional women were in the same boat, Matthias launched a mail-order business selling maternity clothes. The initial response was staggering, and Matthias's company was on its way. What they discovered was that, unlike new mothers of a generation earlier, women were staying in the workforce throughout their pregnancies. The shift was a revolution in the workplace, with Mothers Work supplying the uniforms. Over the next few years, despite a series of setbacks as Matthias and her husband grappled with managing accounting, sales, inventory, and financing, the company gradually took off.<br>
<br>
In the course of describing how she built her business, Matthias reveals hard-won lessons she learned about how to research an idea, test it in the market, raise money, deal with employees, taxes, bankers, cashflow, marketing, franchising, and more. Both motivational and deeply personal, <b>MothersWork</b> offers a three-dimensional blueprint for every woman--and man--who dreams of successfully starting a company.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.53 Inches, Length: 6.27 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/05/9780385495905.jpg,Success,136,22.3.4

Dads Are Deadbeat. Boys Are On The Rampage.

Or Are They? In Stiffed, Susan Faludi, The Acclaimed Author Of Backlash, The Convention-smashing Manifesto On Women's Embattled Status, Turns Her Impressive Powers Of Reporting And Analysis To The Problems Of Men And Comes Up With A Revolutionary Diagnosis. Men's Problems Aren't The Product Of Biology, Or Of Such Trumped-up Enemies As Feminism And Affirmative Action, But Of A Modern Social Tragedy. By Listening To Men's Stories In Their Own Voices, By Taking Them On Their Own Terms, Faludi Uncovers A Buried History- The Untold Story Of How America Made A Glittering Set Of Promises To The Men Of The Baby-boom Generation ... And Proceeded To Break Every One Of Them. The Betrayal Of The American Man Has Been Perpetrated On Many Fronts, From The Boardroom To The Football Stadium, From The Army Recruitment Center To The Suburban Living Room.^ Stiffed Takes Us On A Journey Through A Contemporary Masculine Landscape Littered With Broken Promises And Into The Lives Of Individual Men Whose Accounts Reveal The Heart Of The Male Dilemma. With An Empathetic Vision That Breaks Down The Familiar Lines Of Gender Battle, Faludi Travels Deep Into The Meaning Of Male Anguish. She Intimately Chronicles The Struggles Of Industrial Workers, Sports Fans, Combat Veterans, Evangelical Husbands, Media Executives, Movie Stars, Porn Actors, Militiamen, Astronauts, And Bad Boys--whose Sense That They've Lost Their Skills, Jobs, Civic Roles, Wives, Teams, And Secure Futures Is Only One Symptom Of A Larger And More Profound Collapse. Faludi Pinpoints Men's Greatest Antagonist And Discovers That It Is Not What Conventional Wisdom Would Have Us Believe.^ What Keeps Men From Revolting Against Their Circumstances? Faludi's Explanation For That Mystery Opens Up The Possibility That Men's Coming Rebellion Could Emancipate Both Sexes From Their True And Mutual Enemy, A Cultural Force That Constrains Us All. Stiffed Is A Major Reassessment Of What It Is To Be A Man In Modern America.

<p>""I hear Odessa, a thirty-two-year-old woman, speak at a forum on welfare reform. I ask her about the phrase she used, 'Don't call me out of name,' for it seemed to speak for a whole nation of people. Odessa tells me that women who have no money and no one to stand up for them get put into a bad position and they get misnamed. Most often they get called 'welfare mothers' or 'recipients,' words she will no longer acknowledge. With millions alongside her, Odessa has emerged by her own strength and some opportunity, and now she insists upon naming herself.""</p>
<p>While Lisa Dodson was working in a Charlestown factory twenty years ago, the stories of the women she worked with daily captivated her; she listened to them speak about harsh lives and their deep commitment to family and community. It was the beginning of Dodson's desire to learn the truth and write it down.</p>
<p>For over eight years, Dodson has been documenting the lives of girls and women-hundreds of white, African-American, Latino, Haitian, Irish, and other women in personal interviews, focus groups, surveys, and Life-History Studies. This book is a crossing—a class crossing—taking readers into fellowship with people who are seldom invited to speak but who have powerful stories to tell and who force us to abandon common myths that have been fed to us by the media about school dropouts, teen pregnancy, and welfare ""cheats."" Don't Call Us Out of Name delves deeply into the realities of their lives, often with surprising and uplifting stories of commonplace courage, unimaginable strength, and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>Lisa Dodson does not simply give us the truth about women living in poverty but offers realistic hope for meaningful policy reform based on the experience and analysis of the women we have seen so far only in stereotype and whose voices we have not truly heard. These women emerge as critical contributors to the creation of sound, humane public policy.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.79015356744 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",22,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/90/9780807042090.jpg,Success,136,22.3.4

<p><i>Petal Sweat</i> By Susan Kan</p>
<p>Rhonda Nickels never considered herself a poet, but lately she was drawn to the magnetic poetry kit on the refrigerator in the staff room at the women's health clinic where she worked. The lunchroom was a difficult place for her, she being shy and newly hired. Instead of trying to talk with the other nurses, most of whom spoke about their weekend escapades, dating dilemmas, or children, she would stand at the refrigerator, sipping from her milk carton. Rhonda was interested in their conversations, she had to admit, but she didn't know how to participate comfortably.</p>
<p>A recent graduate from a nursing school in a small Midwestern town, Rhonda's move to Boston had been a big change. Her family back home had been opposed to her leaving, but Rhonda felt the pull of the ocean, the salt spray, and the warm dunes calling out to her. Timid as she was, a kernel of adventurousness was burning inside her. At 31 years old, she felt it was now or never.</p>
<p>At the clinic she was efficient and well-versed in the language of the body, but she interacted with the patients as though they had brought their cars in for tune-ups and repairs. She could say the words breast, vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and Pap smear as easily as mountain, elevator, door, subway, and lunch.</p>
<p>Rhonda pulled the tiny magnets around the refrigerator:</p>
<p><b>sit there and I can cook eggs and meat</b></p>
<p>Not very poetic. The next day she made a list of rhyming words:</p>
<p><b>make lake steak bake fake take</b></p>
<p>One day, about a month into her new city life, as she searched for words, she noticed on the side of the refrigerator facing away from the room a line of wordsall by themselves:</p>
<p><b>we am love by doing</b></p>
<p>Rhonda looked sheepishly around the room to see if anyone saw her. The others were absorbed in the latest <i>People</i> magazine, the one with <i>The First Wives Club</i> actresses on the cover. Turning back to the five simple words, Rhonda thought, <i>Bad grammar</i>. Then after thinking a moment, she wondered, <i>We am love by doing what?</i></p>
<p>Obviously, as a nurse, she knew. She knew what the books said. But as much as she hated to confess this, she had never been in love, and she had</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.6834330122 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/02/9781555835002.jpg,Success,114,22.3.4

0-8014-8637-8,Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,"Reich, Nancy",Cornell University Press,416,7/15/2001,,Paperback,"<p>This absorbing and award-winning biography tells the story of the tragedies and triumphs of Clara Wieck Schumann (1819-1896), a musician of remarkable achievements. At once artist, composer, editor, teacher, wife, and mother of eight children, she was an important force in the musical world of her time. To show how Schumann surmounted the obstacles facing female artists in the nineteenth century, Nancy B. Reich has drawn on previously unexplored primary sources: unpublished diaries, letters, and family papers, as well as concert programs. Going beyond the familiar legends of the Schumann literature, she applies the tools of musicological scholarship and the insights of psychology to provide a new, full-scale portrait.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. In Part One, Reich follows Clara Schumann's life from her early years as a child prodigy through her marriage to Robert Schumann and into the forty years after his death, when she established and maintained an extraordinary European career while supporting and supervising a household and seven children. Part Two covers four major themes in Schumann's life: her relationship with Johannes Brahms and other friends and contemporaries; her creative work; her life on the concert stage; and her success as a teacher.</p>
<p>Throughout, excerpts from diaries and letters in Reich's own translations clear up misconceptions about her life and achievements and her partnership with Robert Schumann. Highlighting aspects of Clara Schumann's personality and character that have been neglected by earlier biographers, this candid and eminently readable account adds appreciably to our understanding of a fascinating artist and woman.</p>
<p>For this revised edition, Reich has added several photographs and updated the text to include recent discoveries. She has also prepared a Catalogue of Works that includes all of Clara Schumann's known published and unpublished compositions and works she edited, as well as descriptions of the autographs, the first editions, the modern editions, and recent literature on each piece. The Catalogue also notes Schumann's performances of her own music and provides pertinent quotations from letters, diaries, and contemporary reviews.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches",17.4,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/71/9780801486371.jpg,Success,122,22.3.4

What he did not mention was that he also intended to string a telegraph wire—""the singing line""—across the brutal Australian Outback, which no human had ever even crossed before. Charles despaired of only one thing: finding a wife willing to brave such hardship with him. Suddenly, twelve-year-old Alice, hiding beneath the chaise longue, piped up: ""I will marry you, Mr. Todd, if no one else will."" And seven years later, so she did.<br>
<br>
Alice Thomson, a young, successful British journalist, decided to trace the paths taken by Charles and Alice Todd, her great-great-grandparents. These two intrepid souls had left the comforts of Victorian England to settle in South Australia, the most remote part of the British Empire in the 1840s. Charles's quest to connect the desolate continent with the rest of the world by stringing telegraph wire from south to north was an almost unimaginably difficult feat. Even today the journey is something of anordeal, as Alice Thomson and her bemused and long-suffering husband, Edward, learned.<br>
<br>
Thomson spins the fascinating tale of the Todds' adventures Down Under with wit and grace. Charles did in fact succeed in laying his ""singing line"" across the Outback, an astonishing feat requiring the peculiarly Victorian virtue of pluck. Alice, from a comfortable home, suddenly had to adapt to the life of a frontier wife in the oddest and most isolated place imaginable. Charles's implacable derring-do—his many expeditions and near-disasters—and Alice's equally brave attempts to re-create a proper British life in a land of dust, flies, kangaroos, and emus make for a tale equal parts charm and excitement.",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/97/9780385490597.jpg,Success,136,22.3.4

Yet these experiences rarely surface in the increasing body of critical literature on womenâs travel writing, which has focused on European or American women traveling to exotic locales as imperial subjects. This stellar collection of essays offers a contestatory discourse that embraces the forms of travelogue, autobiography, and ethnography as vehicles for womenâs rewriting of flawed or incomplete accounts of Caribbean cultures. This study considers writing by Caribbean women, such as the slave narrative of Mary Prince and the autobiography of Jamaican nurse Mary Seacole, and works by women whose travels to the Caribbean had enormous impacts on their own lives, such as Aphra Behn and Zora Neale Hurston. Ranging across cultural, historical, literary, and class dimensions of travel writing, these essays give voice to women writers who have been silenced, ignored, or marginalized.</p>",en,2001,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.21474706362 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches",115,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/63/9780312219963.jpg,Success,131,22.3.4

Yet the cycle of violence and oppression, specifically that which is killing so many young people and especially boys, will not stop until boys are raised to become part of the struggle to end it.<br>
<br>
Drawing on his decades of experience as a social activist and his anti-violence work with men and teens, Kivel challenges the traditional training boys receive. He sorts out and helps parents grapple with the complex forces in our sons' lives, including racism, homophobia, pornography, drugs, classism, consumerism, sex, and living in violent environments. Then, Kivel provides the practical tools to empower boys to take the courageous step out of the ""act like a man"" box and become allies to themselves, each other, and all those who are vulnerable to violence and injustice in our society. The end result gives the reader a powerful vision of raising our sons to be the critically thinking, socially-invested men we need for a multicultural and democratic society.<br>
<br>
<i>Boys will Be Men</i> is for all parents who have a vision of a society where peace and justice exist; for parents raising their sons in economically disadvantaged communities; for feminists who feel confused about raising their sons, and for parents of color who need to add their sons' strength to their communities.<br>

In counterpoint, we see the women left behind in Philadelphia, explorers only in imagination. Together, those who travel and those who stay weave a web of myth and mystery.

Abrams,160,11/1/1999,"Artists, Feminism In Art",Hardcover,"<p>A pioneering force in the feminist art movement of the 1970s, Miriam Schapiro (b. 1923) is an internationally renowned artist. In this, the only comprehensive work on Schapiro, feminist art historian Thalia Gouma-Peterson traces Schapiro's career from her early gestural canvases to her legendary collaborations with other women artists to her femmages (feminist-oriented collages) to her tributes to female artists of the past. Best known for her large heart- and fan-shaped canvases layered with fabric and paint, Schapiro helped launch the Pattern and Decoration movement of the 1970s and '80s and developed a richly decorative style that has influenced a generation of younger artists. Noted scholar Linda Nochlin contributes an insightful foreword, while Gouma-Peterson draws from Schapiro's writings to convey the artist's reflections on art, art history, and the feminist movement.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Now in her seventies, Schapiro is one of the historic foremothers of the American feminist art movement. Yet, apart from Paula Bradley's dissertation, Miriam Schapiro (1983), this is the first work on the artist. The book, accompanying a Schapiro retrospective traveling around the country through 2001, includes 125 illustrations, 75 in full color. Research is based on the artist's notebooks and interviews by Gouma-Peterson, a longtime friend and art critic. Taking a psychoanalytic stance, Schapiro painted beautifully in Abstract Expressionism, then moved to several types of symbolic, geometric, computer-generated entities. The most characteristic works are her unique, highly patterned multimedia collage paintings of fabric and acrylic. From the 1980s on, Shapiro displays even more lushly conceived compositions, both figurative and postmodern.

In recent years, however, social changes and archaeological and historical discoveries have alerted worshiper and scholars to ways in which traditional culture may have distorted the writing of the Bible. Likewise, changes in our society's views of women have affected how we read that book of books.<P>""The family Bible,"" Cullen Murphy writes, ""is as much as anything else an artifact, a symbol of our civilization. Yet it is also the product of a world and of sensibilities manifestly not our own."" In that world, there were no female scholars and theologians. In our world, owing to stunning discoveries of such ancient treasures as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi Library, and given advances in historical understanding, we are able to approach the Bible differently. Today, those who read the Bible query the role that male scholars have traditionally assigned to women, both those who appear in its pages and those who study it.<P>With a keen and informed journalist's intelligence, Cullen Murphy looks at recent Biblical research and interviews scholars who have intensively studied questions about women and the Bible. In the process, he alerts us to much about ourselves and about our sense of worship.</p> <h3>Jo Ann Kay McNamara</h3> <p>Murphy's book is sly and enjoyable.

This comprehensive and well-written book is one of the best of its kind.</p> <h3>Peter Kurth</h3> <p>Chastity Bono has had it either very easy or very hard in her much-publicized coming-out as a lesbian. It's been easy because Chastity has clearly had all kinds of love and support through the whole ordeal. It's been hard because Chastity's a celebrity -- worse, the daughter of celebrities -- and people have been mean about it, although Chastity doesn't like to say so. She really doesn't. A more tolerant, thoughtful and level-headed lesbian you will not meet this season. <i>Family Outing</i> is Chastity's account of how she -- and many other gays and lesbians of her acquaintance -- have got their stuff so well together. <P>Of course, everyone remembers 'Chas,' as she is called in her family. Some may even remember the days when Cher was pregnant with Chas, or, before that, when she and Sonny Bono declared on national television that they were trying to get pregnant. This is the kind of thing that floats around the life of a celebrity child. The toddler Chastity, who made regular appearances on her parents' TV show (and apparently still gets residuals from them), was the little blond buffer between the dark and smoldering Cher and the dark and dimwitted Sonny, one of the most humiliated men on television. Trouble is, Chastity didn't grow up on television. When her parents divorced, she remained a buffer, and was already worrying at the age of 13 how she could ever tell them the truth: that she was a lesbian. A real lesbian, it needs to be said, not a kid acting out or following a trend. 'As a child,' Chastity writes, 'I didn't have the words to explain why I preferred dressing in boys' clothes. I didn't understand why I felt different or why my mother seemed so upset by certain things about me.' Chastity's love life with women began when she was still in her early teens, and she had just come out to her parents when she was outed by the tabloid newspapers -- a horrible experience, as she tells it, that sent her scurrying for privacy for a number of years. Slowly, she got her confidence back, and in April 1995 she came out publicly on the cover of the <i>Advocate</i>. 'My simple goal was to give back what had been given to me,' Bono writes: 'When I read or heard about gays and lesbians being vocal and standing up for who they are, I felt stronger about myself. Now I wanted to see if I could help people struggling to come out and show them the rich rewards outside the closet.' And that's what <i>Family Outing</i> sets out to do. It's not an autobiography; it doesn't dish on Sonny and Cher. Chastity weaves her own story around conversations with other gay men and women in an effort to give a true picture of, and some helpful hints about, the perils of coming out. Most of the text consists of other people's stories and an inoffensive, deeply unthreatening commentary that veers toward but stops just short of psychobabble. <i>Family Outing</i> could have been ridiculous, but it isn't. It's just nice.<P>A black heart would be tempted to tell Bono that, when her mother looked askance at her clothes when she was growing up, she may have been horrified by something other than lesbianism. After all, Chastity, your mother is Cher. -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",17.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/64/9780316115964.jpg,Success,144,22.3.4

Because Mamphela Ramphele began her life as a shy child born into the cage of apartheid - and gradually became an activist who helped set South Africa free -her personal story enlarges each reader's sense of possibilities. Because she was part of the Black Consciousness Movement that linked the personal to the political, she teaches us that race, sex, and class are linked, and that enemies can only be defeated if we refuse to imitate them. . . . No matter where or how each of us lives, <i>Across Boundaries</i> gives us a rare leader who teaches us to teach ourselves.-Gloria Steinem</p>

In addition to recounting the fascinating and often gripping events of her life, she describes the personal side of her experiences - her early struggles to maintain dignity and hope in a world that devalued both black people and women; her battles against despair, especially after the murder of her colleague and lover Steven Biko and the death of her third child in infancy; her mistakes and regrets as well as her triumphs.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.80909650154 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",12.81,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/65/9781558611665.jpg,Success,94,22.3.4

But, the story belongs to Grandma Gabi, who calms the children after their play with cookies and a story from her own childhood. Grandma Gabi, it seems, grew up in Czechoslovakia during World War II and played a life and death version of hide-and-seek with Nazi soldiers who had invaded her home. The raid was the last in a series of increasing intrusions and restrictions the German government had placed upon all peoples in the countries they'd conquered who didn't belong to their ideal superior race. This book, based on real people and real events, tells a chillingly real story from the child Gabi's point of view. The fact that Grandma Gabi tells the story to her grandchildren happily lessens the suspense about what happened to her personally during the war. But the reality she portrays of being a regular kid who has to endure the gradual loss of friends, family, possessions, and routines of normal life comes through hauntingly in this well-crafted, relentless, and unforgettable tale of courage, oppression, and love. 1999, Second Story Press, Ages 8 up, $4.95.

Through arranged marriages, profitable alliances were made, territory gained and bridges built. But the women-though technically the possessions of their menfolk-were far from passive creatures. There are accounts of bravery and love affairs, papal separations and religious devotion.

I think I’m your birth mother.” So begins this powerful memoir by a young woman whose life changes dramatically when she receives a phone call from someone at once a stranger and her most intimate relation. Saffian’s riveting story of painful self-discovery and newfound joy is unique in its reversal of the usual adoption narrative: here, the biological parents seek out the adoptee. Weaving together letters, journal entries, memories and relections, Saffian tells of her adoption, her adoptive mother’s death six years later, and her upbringing in a loving family. She learns that her biological parents ended up marrying and having other children. She is thus faced with an entire family to whom she is genetically linked. Saffian’s boldly honest account reaches a moving climax with their reunion, three years after the first phone call. Along the way, it raises thorny questions: What is a family? Can we have more than one? What is the line between parental concern and intrusion? Is it hypocritical to be a pro-choice adoptee? How do nature and nurture work together to form a person’s identity? By turns earnest and playful, <i>Ithica: A Daughter’s Memoir of Being Found</i> is sure to touch readers everywhere who have grappled with who they are.Sarah Saffian is a former reporter for the New York Daily News and has also written for the <i>Village Voice, Interview, Harper’s Bazaar, and Mirabella.</i> She holds a B.A. from Brown University and an M.F.A. from Columbia University, and lives in her native New York City.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/18/9780385334518.jpg,Success,136,22.3.4

<p>From high-profile women's professional leagues to high-school-level champions, girl athletes are acheiving record breakthroughs. Witness, for example, the first spectacular season of the WNBA, or the celebrated victories of women's teams at the 1996 Olympics. The female athlete is a new media darling especially beloved of today's teenage girls, who are almost as likely to have pictures of Rebecca Lobo, Mia Hamm, or Gabrielle Reece on their walls as posters of Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
<p>So it seems paradoxical that many books and studies attest to a truly sobering picture of girls' lives. With her book <b>Reviving Ophelia</b>, Mary Pipher was only the latest in a string of theorists to describe the dramatic ways in which girls loose self-esteem during the critical years of adolescence, contributing to eating disorders, drug problems, and chronic depression in many young women. In <b>Raising Our Athletic Daughters</b>, journalists Zimmerman and Reavill set out to talk with girls and their parents about&nbsp;&nbsp;how sports can transform girls' lives. Here are firsthand stories from the inner cities and rural playing fields across the nation, offering compelling evidence that participation in athletics makes an extraordinary difference in the lives of young girls, from reducing pregnancy rates and substance abuse to increasing college attendance. <b>Raising Our Athletic Daughters</b> is a clarion call for all those eager to help their children succeed and level the playing field, at last.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.79 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",19,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/07/9780385489607.jpg,Success,135,22.3.4

Drawing on their diverse spiritual backgrounds (Orsborn is Jewish and a student of Eastern philosophy; Kuner studied with a Sufi teacher; Quigley has undergone 12-Step programs; and Stroup is a Christian minister), the authors have crafted a framework that allows women to view their cancer as part of an encounter with their deepest selves. They postulate five stages through which initiates travel on the journey from fear to acceptance: impact, chaos, choices, community and spirit. As each author relates her experiences--such as confronting fears of death, pain and isolation, choosing between mainstream and alternative therapies and enduring the loss of hair, self-esteem, friends and, in once case a fianc --she suggests ways to counter the prevailing view of doctors and patients that patients who fight back stand the greatest chance of being healed, that survivors are winners and those who die have lost their battles. Readers at any stage of breast cancer treatment will likely take comfort from the authors' spiritual emphasis. Agent, Linda Roghaar. (Oct.)

Walk On Water Is Lorian Hemingway's Amazing Story Of How Her One True Passion-fishing-saved Her Life. With Humor And Startling Honesty, Hemingway Wryly Acknowledges How Fishing Is More Than A Metaphor For Her Salvation-it Allowed Her To Feel Connected To Something As A Child, Living With Her Alcoholic Mother And Abusive Stepfather. It Helped Her To Heal After A To-hell-and-back Fight For Sobriety.

California",Anchor,384,12/28/1999,,Paperback,"<p><P>A dramatic and thought-provoking novel of one family's triumph in the face of the hardships and challenges of the post-Civil War South.<P><b>The Wake of the Wind</b>, J. California Cooper's third novel, is her most penetrating look yet at the challenges that generations of African Americans have had to overcome in order to carve out a home for themselves and their families. Set in Texas in the waning years of the Civil War, the novel tells the dramatic story of a remarkable heroine, Lifee, and her husband, Mor. When Emancipation finally comes to Texas, Mor, Lifee, and the extended family they create from other slaves who are also looking for a home and a future, set out in search of a piece of land they can call their own. In the face of constant threats, they manage not only to survive but to succeed&#151;their crops grow, their children thrive, they educate themselves and others. Lifee and Mor pass their intelligence, determination, and talents along to their children, the next generation to surge forward. At once tragic and triumphant, this is an epic story that captures with extraordinary authenticity the most important struggle of the last hundred years.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Cooper's disappointing third novel (after Family) frustrates readers with a good premise poorly executed. Mordecai and Lifee meet as slaves on a plantation in post-Civil War Texas. Forced to marry by their master before they even know each other, they fall in love just as emancipation is declared, and head east with several other newly freed companions to look for a safe place to live. Cooper conveys the mixture of hope, fear and confusion as hungry and footsore former slaves move across the country. Mor and Lifee find work at a ruined plantation in Georgia and begin a family; and in time, the owner secretly sells her property to them. The tightly knit clan of former slaves prospers, but when lynchings in the area become frequent, they are forced to leave. Eventually they settle on an abandoned farm, where they survive economic depression and other troubles. When tragedy ensues, the next generation must assume responsibility for preserving the family. Though Cooper's research about the troubled historical era provides good details, her characters are mainly two-dimensional stereotypes. The blacks are good, with pure hearts; the whites (with one exception) are duplicitous. Moreover, the prose is wooden and preachy, lacking grace or nuance. This earnest saga of freed slaves aspiring to new lives in the Reconstruction South is commendable in intent but pedestrian in execution.

She was a very private person, leaving even her advisors wondering at the motivations for many of her decisions and actions. In her new book, <i>The Life of Elizabeth I</i>, Tudor authority Alison Weir tackles many of the mysteries that have for centuries surrounded Elizabeth: Was she somehow involved in the murder of the Earl of Leicester's wife? Was she really a ""Virgin"" Queen? Was her decision not to marry tied to the fate of her mother, Anne Boleyn?</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Weir describes herself as a social historian but admits that when chronicling the lives of the flamboyant Tudors, it's impossible to keep domestic politics and world affairs apart. One could hardly ignore the threatened depredations of the ""invincible"" Spanish Armada or pass over the intrigues of Mary Queen of Scots as she struggled to seize the throne and return England to Roman Catholicism. Weir has already negotiated the complex matrimonial life of Elizabeth's father in<i> The Six Wives of Henry VIII</i> and the early lives of the resulting progeny in <i>The Children of Henry VIII</i>. <p>After a lonely and often perilous childhood during which Elizabeth was once imprisoned in the Tower and was nearly executed at the behest of her half sister, Queen Mary, 25-year-old Elizabeth ascended to the throne when Mary died. The prevailing expectation was that she would speedily marry a strong man who would then take over as king: as Elizabeth herself admitted, it was commonly thought that ""a woman cannot live unless she is married."" Elizabeth did nothing of the kind and, as Weir details, she did quite well for herself manipulating the royal marriage mart of Europe. <p>Weir uses myriad details of dress, correspondence and contemporary accounts to create an almost affectionate portrait of a strong, well-educated ruler loved by her courtiers and people alike. Hot-tempered, imperious Elizabeth has been the subject of innumerable biographies, many very good. But Weir brings a fine sense of selection and considerable zest to her portrait of the self-styled Virgin Queen.</p>",en,Reissue,"Height: 8.16 Inches, Length: 5.49 Inches, Weight: 0.925 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches",18,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/08/9780345425508.jpg,Success,134,22.3.4

First we're horrified, but each time they turn up the pitch, show us one image more hideous than the next, it gets harder and harder to feel. Meet compassion fatigue--a modern syndrome, Susan Moeller argues, that results from formulaic media coverage, sensationalized language and overly Americanized metaphors. 
<p>In her impassioned new book, <i>Compassion Fatigue,</i> Moeller warns that the American media threatens our ability to understand the world around us. Why do the media cover the world in the way that they do? Are they simply following the marketplace demand for tabloid-style international news? Or are they creating an audience that has seen too much--or too little--to care? Through a series of case studies of the ""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse""--disease, famine, death and war--Moeller investigates how newspapers, newsmagazines and television have covered international crises over the last two decades, identifying the ruts into which the media have fallen and revealing why.</p>
<p>Throughout, we hear from industry insiders who tell of the chilling effect of the mega-media mergers, the tyranny of the bottom-line hunt for profits, and the decline of the American attention span as they struggle to both tell and <i>sell</i> a story. But Moeller is insistent that the media need not, and should not, be run like any other business. The media have a special responsibility to the public, and when they abdicate this responsibility and the public lapses into a compassion fatigue stupor, we become a public at great danger to ourselves.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.02 Inches, Length: 5.99 Inches, Weight: 1.6314207388 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches",41.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/88/9780415920988.jpg,Success,154,22.3.4

Until now, however, no one has written the story of this woman of extraordinary talent and notoriety. She was a great beauty, an aristocratic refugee of the Russian Revolution, and a frankly erotic painter who insisted upon Renaissance aesthetics, figuration, and painterly craft in modern art. The sky-high prices attached to her canvases in recent years have still not dispelled the suspicions that a woman of Lempicka's glamour and fame could be a truly serious artist. Yet the reviews of the early twentieth century tell a different story: her work was routinely singled out as competing with major figures of the School of Paris, including Léger, Laurençin, Kisling, and Picasso.
<p>In this first critical biography, Laura Claridge draws upon her exclusive access to Lempicka's family, friends, and archives to re-create the life that the painter carefully withheld even from her own daughter: the truth of her birth; her escape from Bolshevik Russia; her determination to become a New Woman; her lifelong bouts of depression; her numerous affairs with the women and men she painted; her flight from Nazi Europe via Havana; and her years in Hollywood and New York as the ""Baroness with a brush,"" all informed by the artistic integrity and social anachronism that condemned her to being written out of the canons of modern art.</p>
<p>Emblematic of '20s excess and indulgence, Tamara de Lempicka's life of great wealth, indiscriminate sexuality, and endless intrigue makes for a fascinating narrative. But her paintings have inspired fierce disagreements over issues of class, wealth, and gender in modern art, making her work ripe for critical re-evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence, Laura Claridge has succeeded brilliantly on both counts, bringing to light the contradictions that fueled the life and work of this provocative painter.</p>
<p>Though Paris in the early twenties certainly earned its bohemian reputation, Tamara was playing the game hard by anyone's standards. It seemed to her that she could have it all: respect, money, and sexual gratification on the side. She had arrived at the Gare du Nord only four years earlier, gifted with a painter's talent and a family history of feminine power. Encountering a cultural climate that affirmed art as a remunerative career for women, she also felt freed personally by the Modernist mantra to ""make it new"" that underwrote every aspect--trivial and profound--of daily life. She was determined to embody that icon of the age, the new woman.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.95 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",35,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/75/9780517705575.jpg,Success,32,22.3.4

This celebration of Mexican ceramics combines a gallery of more than one hundred stunning photographs with an insightful text that illuminates the artistry and the artists&#151;all of whom are women. The fanciful, brightly colored works spring from the rich imaginations of rural women drawing on enduring religion, mythology, and themes from their everyday lives. <i>Oaxacan Ceramics</i> tells the remarkable story of six of the most renowned artisans who live and work in villages near the city of Oaxaca. Their exuberant, whimsical creations range from the fantastic to the religious, including mermaids, angels, Zapotec creatures, figures of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, vases, candle holders, and decorative plates&#151;all finely crafted and distinctly colored. <i>Oaxacan Ceramics</i> paints an extraordinary portrait of a vibrant culture and its art.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Oaxaca is one of the poorest states in Mexico, and nearly half a million of its three million inhabitants have turned to the craft traditions of their ancestors to sustain themselves. Among the many popular art forms, the folk art of ceramics is the most widespread. Colorful and insightful, this book profiles the top artists working in this popular craft today and celebrates the new direction taken in pottery--the transition from utilitarian to whimsical and decorative. While some pieces remain utilitarian, others sport colorful fish or angel faces protruding in bas-relief. Bright, cheerful colors cover nativity figurines, animals and mermaids from folklore, skeletons in dress-up, and Frida Kahlo lookalikes. Wasserspring (Latin American studies, Wellesley Coll.) discusses the lives of the mostly women potters as well as their techniques and artistic tradition. The quality of the photographs and paper is outstanding, as is the price for such a well-produced art book. Although there are many larger books on Mexican art, as a single source on Oaxacan ceremics, this book is unique. Recommended for academic libraries and large public libraries with contemporary or Latin American art collections as well as special libraries with an interest in Latin American art or culture.--Sylvia Andrews, Indiana State Lib., Indianapolis Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 1.4109584768 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",4.82,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/86/9780811823586.jpg,Success,138,22.3.4

Before long the therapist suggested to her that perhaps her problem was actually multiple personality disorder (MPD), a condition that according to the ""experts"" was connected to childhood abuse. With coaching from the therapist-and under heavy medication-Carlson soon came up with more than twenty-five personalities, including Wild Child, Sister Mary Margaret, and Little Miss Fluff. Horrifying abuse memories invaded her consciousness. She had been molested, she said, by her parents, her grandparents, her great-grandparents. Her family was part of a satanic cult. They raped and killed. They aborted babies and ate the afterbirth. Or did they?
<p>In Creating Hysteria Joan Acocella tells how, over the past three decades, thousands of women seeking help for various psychological problems were told that they had multiple personality disorder and were sucked into this nightmarish therapy. In session after session, under their therapists' prompting, they produced ""memories""-and screaming reenactments-of childhood victimization. Asked to search within themselves for hidden personalities, they came up with entire squadrons: children, harlots, angels, devils. Prior to the 1970s, multiple personality disorder was considered an exotically rare condition. But beginning in the 1980s, an estimated 40,000 people, most of them women, had been initiated into this newly popular disorder.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking book describes how a group of reckless therapists used hypnosis, drugs, and sheer persuasion to mold their patients' symptoms into multiple personality disorder. While these practitioners were publishing books and running workshops on how to ""spot"" MPD, the patients were languishing in hospitals—in some cases for years. They sacrificed their marriages, their jobs. Some even lost their children.</p>
<p>Creating Hysteria analyzes the forces that fed into the MPD epidemic: media sensationalism, Christian fundamentalism, the culture wars, and feminism. (Though ruinous to women, this diagnosis was endorsed by many feminists.) Money was another factor. MPD, the experts said, took years to cure. An MPD diagnosis was one way of getting around the new restrictions placed on psychotherapy by managed care.</p>
<p>Eventually, victims of this cruel hoax discovered what had happened to them and began suing their therapists. As a result, the MPD empire is now crumbling. In her brilliant concluding chapters, Acocella describes the damage this bizarre craze did to the profession of psychotherapy, to the child-protection movement, and to women's rights. The patients ultimately triumphed, but the wreckage will take years to clear away.</p>
<p>Manufactured Epidemic: The True Story of MPD</p>
<p>From 1985 to 1995 an estimated 40,000 Americans, most of them women, were told they suffered from multiple personality disorder. Feminists, fundamentalists, and a substantial portion of the mental health community endorsed this ""Sybil-ing"" of America. Sensation-seeking television talk shows took up the MPD rallying cry. In Creating Hysteria, Joan Acocella tells a riveting tale of therapists betraying their patients, of a psychotherapy profession at war within its own ranks, and finally of expatients rising up and putting an end to the MPD scandal.</p>
<p>""Creating Hysteria exposes one of the most frightening mental roller coaster rides taken by thousands of people in modern times. Joan Acocella brilliantly illuminates how the mental health profession spearheaded, perhaps inadvertently, a fin-de-si?cle hysteria, the fallout from which will take us into the next millennium. Anyone who has ever been interested in mental health should read this book.""<br>
—Elizabeth Loftus, president, American Psychological Society</p>
<p>""A remarkable expos? of an embarrassing and mischievous epidemic instigated by a small group of 'multiple personality' proponents. This book provides ample warning for patients and therapists alike.""<br>
—Herbert Spiegel, psychiatrist, expert on ""Sybil"" case</p>
<p>""Multiple personality disorder is both fascinating and sad, but the story of its recent social evolution is deeply disturbing. Creating Hysteria tells a gripping tale that will captivate anyone interested in the pathology of the human mind and the cultural forces that shape it.""<br>
—Daniel L. Schacter, professor and chair of psychology, Harvard University</p>
<p>""As Acocella makes devastatingly clear, MPD was a disease essentially created by unethical or incompetent therapists and imposed upon their vulnerable female patients. Creating Hysteria tells a sorrowful, infuriating story that compels and deserves attention.""<br>

Consider Janet Todd's history a bouquet heaped upon that grave.
<p>Aphra Behn (1640?- 1689), poet, playwright; novelist, traveller, and spy, was the first woman to earn her living as a writer. Myths held her to be the illegitimate daughter of Lady Mary Wroth or an American courtesan. Janet Todd's definitive literary biography, using recently discovered documents in England and The Netherlands, firmly establishes Behn as a English-woman of humble beginnings who transformed herself into one of most prominent Restoration playwrights.</p>
<p>Behn's works, of which Oroonoko and The Rover remain the most well known, are openly erotic, with much political critique and an understanding of the complexities of race. Behn's daring writing and relationships with Nell Gwyn, the Stuart kings, and the Duchess of Mazarine made her a byword for sexual licence.</p>

Revealing the story of her own decision not to have children, Laurie Lisle draws from history, literature, religion and sociology to challenge the stigma attached to the condition of childlessness-and to offer encouragement and support to those women who have made the difficult decision themselves.<br><br> Beginning with the difficult inner journey a woman faces before finally deciding or realizing she will not bear children,<i> Without Child</i> explores the myth of the childless woman's rejection of the maternal instinct. It also explores the childless woman's relationship to mothers and mothering, to her femininity, to men, to achievement, to her body, and to old age. Wide-ranging yet intimate, philosophical, yet clear-sighted, this important book does what no other has done before-presents childlessness in a multifaceted and positive light.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>The ``rejection of parenthood,'' as the author of this carefully researched study found, ``is a delicate and even dangerous topic.'' Lisle (Portrait of an Artist: A Biography of Georgia O'Keeffe) speaks for herself and the generation of women who came of age in the 1970s who are childless for a variety of reasons, but often by choice. Intertwining the account of her own tortured decision to choose childlessness and the views and experiences of women past and present, Lisle pierces some of the myths and stereotypes that surround non-mothers. She reveals a long and laudable history of women without progeny, and indicates that there has been ambivalence in mothers and non-mothers alike about their roles. As an advocate for a misunderstood minority, she points to the many ways a woman's childlessness, often perceived as selfish, can promote and nurture life-enhancing relationships. Author tour.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logan develops each chapter in this illustrated study around a feature of public address as best exemplified in the oratory of a particular woman speaker of the era. She analyzes not only speeches but also editorials, essays, and letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logan first focuses on the prophetic oratory of Maria Stewart, the first American-born black woman to speak publicly. Turning to Frances Harper, she considers speeches that argue for common interests between divergent communities. And she demonstrates that central to the antilynching rhetoric of Ida Wells is the concept of ""presence,"" or the tactic of enhancing certain selected elements of the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her discussion of Fannie Barrier Williams and Anna Cooper, Logan shows that when speaking to white club women and black clergymen, both Williams and Cooper employ what Kenneth Burke called identification. To analyze the rhetoric of Victoria Matthews, she applies Carolyn Miller's modification of Lloyd Bitzer's concept of the rhetorical situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logan also examines the discourse of women associated with the black Baptist women's movement and those participating in college-affiliated conferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book includes an appendix with little-known speeches and essays by Anna Julia Cooper, Selena Sloan Butler, Lucy Wilmot Smith, Mary V. Cook, Adella Hunt Logan, Victoria Earle Matthews, Lucy C.

Among feminists, two fundamentally differing views of women in the military have developed. Feminist antimilitarists tell us that militarism and patriarchy have together pressed women into second class citizenship. Meanwhile, feminist soldiers and their advocates regard martial service as women's right and responsibility and the ticket to first class citizenship.</p>
<p><b>Citizenship Rites</b> investigates what is at stake for women in these debates. Exploring the perspectives of both feminist antimilitarists and feminist soldiers, Ilene Feinman situates the current combat controversy within the context of the sea change in United States politics since the 1970s-from ERA debates over drafting women to recent representations of military women such as the film <i>GI Jane</i>. Drawing on congressional testimony, court cases, feminist and antiracist political discourse, and antimilitarist activism, Feinman addresses our pressing need for an analysis of women's increasing inclusion in the armed forces while providing a provocative investigation of what this changing role means for women and society alike.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",26,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/91/9780814726891.jpg,Success,43,22.3.4

0-8133-6702-6,The Naked and the Undead: Evil and the Appeal of Horror (Thinking Through Cinema),"Freeland, Cynthia",Westview Press,320,10/1/1999,,Hardcover,"<p>Horror is often dismissed as mass art or lowbrow entertainment that produces only short-term thrills. Horror films can be bloody, gory, and disturbing, so some people argue that they have bad moral effects, inciting viewers to imitate cinematic violence or desensitizing them to atrocities. In <i>The Naked and the Undead: Evil and the Appeal of Horror</i>, Cynthia A. Freeland seeks to counter both aesthetic disdain and moral condemnation by focusing on a select body of important and revealing films, demonstrating how the genre is capable of deep philosophical reflection about the existence and nature of evil—both human and cosmic. In exploring these films, the author argues against a purely psychoanalytic approach and opts for both feminist and philosophical understandings. She looks at what it is in these movies that serves to elicit specific reactions in viewers and why such responses as fear and disgust are ultimately pleasurable. The author is particularly interested in showing how gender figures into screen presentations of evil.The book is divided into three sections: Mad Scientists and Monstrous Mothers, which looks into the implications of male, rationalistic, scientific technology gone awry; The Vampire’s Seduction, which explores the attraction of evil and the human ability (or inability) to distinguish active from passive, subject from object, and virtue from vice; and Sublime Spectacles of Disaster, which examines the human fascination with horror spectacle. This section concludes with a chapter on graphic horror films like <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>. Written for both students and film enthusiasts, the book examines a wide array of films including: <i>The Silence of the Lambs, Repulsion, Frankenstein, The Fly, Dead Ringers, Alien, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Interview with the Vampire, Frenzy, The Shining, Eraserhead, Hellraiser,</i> and many others.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",26,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/26/9780813367026.jpg,Success,149,22.3.4

However, each of us can respond to any of these things in a manner of our own choosing. <i>The Courage to Give</i> is an amazing collection of stories by thirty people about their situations and their chosen responses. As Joan Lunden, former host of Good Morning, America writes in her foreword: It is easy to stay in a place of pain, wondering 'Why me?' questioning life, or feeling sadness and sorrow. But if we make the effort to help someone else, we begin the healing process for ourselves. Each one of us has the ability to answer that call to action. If we identify a need in our community or hear someone crying out for help, we can and we must answer the call. The people Jackie profiles in this book, in spite of their physical or emotional pain, heard the call and sprung into action, making a difference in our world. Their courage inspires us to remember, even in the face of adversity, our responsibility to each other and ultimately to ourselves. It's one of the most wonderful compensations of life-that no person can sincerely try to help another without helping themselves.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",10.42,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/55/9781573241755.jpg,Success,116,22.3.4

<br>
Beginning in 1869, when the study of homosexuality can be said to have begun with the establishment of sexology, this encyclopedia offers accounts of the most important international developments in an area that now occupies a critical place in many fields of academic endeavors. It covers a long history and a dynamic and ever changing present, while opening up the academic profession to new scholarship and new ways of thinking.<br>
<br>
<b>A groundbreaking new approach</b><br>
While gays and lesbians have shared many aspects of life, their histories and cultures developed in profoundly different ways. To reflect this crucial fact, the encyclopedia has been prepared in two separate volumes assuring that both histories receive full, unbiased attention and that a broad range of human experience is covered.<br>
<br>
<b>Written for and by a wide range of people</b> <br>
Intended as a reference for students and scholarsin all fields, as well as for the general public, the encyclopedia is written in user-friendly language. At the same time it maintains a high level of scholarship that incorporates both passion and objectivity. It is written by some of the most famous names in the field, as well as new scholars, whose research continues to advance gender studies into the future.

                        <p>""This source is unique among encyclopedias of homosexuality with separate volumes devoted to gay and lesbian issues. The volumes consist of short, signed entries arranged alphabetically.

She Visualizes Me As A Shadow, As Her Car Zooms Around The Curves That Take Her Rapidly Down The Mountain. She Is Listening To A Music I Have Not Heard In Many Years. At First I Think It Is Portuguese Fado; Then I Realize It Is Flamenco, Which Is Also Characterized By Passion And Profound Sadness. She Moans Along With The Woman Who Is Singing -- Wailing, Really -- Her Hands Gripping The Steering Wheel To The Plangent Cries Of The Singer And The Sobbing Of Violins. The Momentum Of Her Flight Sets The Old Swing To Rocking. Her Car Is Old And Black. It Was Another Expression Of My Effort To Contact Her. <p> She Was Not Even Aware At The Time Of My Death That She Missed Me. Poor Child. She Did Not Cry At My Funeral. She Was A Stoic Spectator. Her Heart, She Thought, Was Closed. I Watched Her Looking Down At Me, The Father Who Gave Her Life, With The Passivity Of One Who Has Borne All She Intends To Bear. She Did Not Even Bother To Smirk As Platitudes About Me -- Most Of Them Absurd -- Filled The Church Around Her. When An Especially Large Falsehood Was Uttered -- That I Would Never Have Hurt A Fly, For Instance -- She Merely Closed Her Eyes. At The Gravesite She Clutched The Arm Of Her Greek Husband, With His Hard Curly Hair And Black Mustache, And, Leaning As If To Whisper In His Hairy Ear, Discreetly Yawned. <p> She Did Not Know Of My Sorrow, Dying. Poor Child. How Could She Know? <p> That Night, Eating A Pomegranate Seed By Seed Beside The Fire, She Did Not Miss Me. She Felt Rather As If Something Heavy And Dark, Something She Could Never Explain, Had Rolled Away, Off Her Soul. Shameless, Curious, Forsaken Somehow, I Watched Her And The Greek Husband, Late Into The Night, Make Love. <p> The Recent Stirrings That Intimated My Presence Began With Her Desire To Know About Angels. Where They Come From In The Imagination, Why People In All Cultures Find It Difficult If Not Impossible To Live Without Them. Is The Angel In The Imagination A Memory Of A Loved One Who Has Died? Is The Angel An Earth Spirit Existing In Its Own Right, Touching Us With The Benign Blessing And Direction Of Nature? Why Was She Dreaming Of Angels Every Night? <p> She And The Greek Went To Kalimasa. This Was Before Tourists Exhausted The Public Kalimasan Spirit, And There, Everywhere, In Everyone's Home, Flew An Angel. <i>watti-tuus,</i> As They Were Called. Some Of Them Were Simply Winged Women, With A Woman's Hands And Eyes And Feet. But Some Were Winged Mermaids, Their Bronze Scales Dusted With Gold. Some Were White As Apples; Others As Brown As Shining Earth. She Was -- My Daughter, Susannah -- Enchanted. <p> The Greek, Petros, Was Charmed By Her Passion. I Watched As He Fed Himself Full Meals From The Store Of Her Enthusiasm. She Was Radiant And Sensual. I Saw That First Time In Kalimasa That She Was, As A Woman, Someone I Truly Did Not Know. <p> Petros Bought An Angel For Her, A <i>watti-tuu,</i> As A Surprise. It Was A Dark-haired, Dark-skinned, Full-breasted Woman, With A Belly Filled With Small People, Tiny Houses, Birds. Its Wings Were Painted Shimmering Green. She Laughed Gaily, As She Had As A Child. She Clapped Her Hands. Joy Radiated From Her Eyes. This Was The Spirit I Had Not Seen For Decades. I Recognized It, Though. And Drew Near To It, As If To A Fire. I Saw Her Frown, Suddenly, As If Aware Of My Shadow, And I Hastily And Regretfully Withdrew. <p> The Second Time She Went To Kalimasa, Petros Did Not Go. She Had Lost Him Back In The States. This Time She Traveled With A Woman Who Dressed Inappropriately For The Culture, And Wore Her Bathing Suit All Day Long, And Accepted Motorcycle Rides From The Local Village Males, Who Were Losing Their Modesty And Learning To Take Whatever Pleasure Came Their Way From The Shameless Tourist Women. This Woman, Though Good In Bed, So Irritated My Daughter That She Remained In The Guest House They Shared, Day After Sultry Day, A Blue Linen Sheet Drawn Taut Over Her Head. <p> But When She Did Venture Out Onto The Two Streets Of The Tiny Village Of Wodra, More Touristed Than She Would Have Dreamed Possible The Last Time She Was There, She Did So Feeling There Was Something Drawing Her. Of Course She Did Not Know What It Was. <p> Damp, Perspiring, Though It Was Only Eight Or Nine In The Morning, She Found Herself At A Jeweler's. <p> The Kalimasans Are Famous For Their Graceful Aesthetic Sense. For Their Innate Appreciation Of Balance And Proportion. This Sense Of What Is Just Right Can Be Seen In Their Architecture, In Their Canals, In Their Waterfalls. Even In Their Hairstyles. It Is Often Said By Visitors That Everything In Their Landscape, Except The Mountains That Frame Most Villages Like Spectacular Stage Props, Is Artificially Constructed, Yet Looks Totally Natural. The Fineness Of The Kalimasans' Eye Is Pronounced In The Jewelry And Clothing They Make. <p> The Shop, Like All The Shops On That End Of The Street Near The Restaurant And The River, Was Quite Small. Only A Few Feet Deep, After You Climbed Three Steep Steps Up From The Road. There Were Four Rows Of Trinkets: Rings, Bracelets, Necklaces. Nothing Costing More Than Fifty U.s. Dollars. Susannah Began To Try On Bracelets, The Ones That Are Made Of Brass And Look A Hundred Years Old, Though They Might Have Been Made Yesterday. And Then Her Eye Fell On The Ring She'd Been Looking For Without Knowing It. Black Onyx, An Oval Shape. Its Sides Splashed With Gold. Though, Since The Ring Cost Only Eighteen Dollars, Perhaps The Gold Was Something Else. The Ring Fit Her Finger Perfectly. Happily She Paid The Young Hindu Shopkeeper, Continued On Her Way Through The Village Of Wodra, And Was Even Inspired To Go As Far As The Elephant Walk, A Mile And A Half From The Village, Before Giving In To The Desire To Return To The Guest House. <p> What Is The Meaning Of This Ring? The Woman Asked At Dinner, In The Whining, Bossy Voice My Daughter Had Come To Dread. <p> It Is Beautiful, Said Susannah. She Raised Her Hand To Her Cheek And Rested It There. The Light From The Candle Made The Gold Splashes Beside The Onyx Glow Red. <p> I Wanted To Give You A Ring For That Finger, The Woman Pouted. <p> But I Have Nine Others, Said My Daughter.

Throughout her career, Conway lived the life she portrayed in her art, combining a cafe and cabaret social life with hard work and a reputation for never missing deadlines.

Haunted by the harsh words of her domineering mother, who demanded that she suppress her tomboyish tendencies during her childhood, Aline has become a demure, passive, conventional woman. She fails to recognize the man standing before her, who the author names Orlanda. The body belongs to that of Lucien Lèfrene, a lithe 20-year-old rock journalist, but it is inhabited by her once silenced spirit, and possesses her knowledge, memories, and desires, including her love of men.<br>
When the two meet again in Belgium, Aline subconsciously sheds her prim tendencies for more assertive behavior, as she begins to understand that the audacious and lively Orlanda was born from her psyche. The more time the two spend together, the less time they can stand to be apart.<br>

In Weissler's hands, these prayers (called thkines) open a new window into early modern European Jewish women's lives, beliefs, devotion, and relationships with God.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>A heartfelt tkhine--a plea to God--to bless the Sabbath bread as it is placed in the oven provides a fitting opener for this book in which Weissler (Religion, Lehigh) delves into the prayers of Jewish women in early modern Europe. Her study reveals a nearly lost genre of Jewish literature. She recovers and showcases the words of Yiddish women who prayed faithfully and frequently for blessings during everyday occurrences, such as the lighting of the Sabbath candles, and when preparing for the holidays, especially for the Days of Awe--Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Weissler examines the tkhine not only as lovely prose but as a reflection of the devotional lives of 17th-19th century Jewish women. Individual chapters focus on tkhines for pregnancy, childbirth, candle lighting and death, and a number of tkhines are reproduced in all their beauty and simplicity: May it be Thy Will, Lord our God, God of our Fathers, to bring on the coming month for our good and blessing. Weissler deftly blends historic poetry and scholarly text in this look at an important facet of Jewish history.

Now, in her own moving words, the woman behind the myth is revealed. The result is a captivating self-portrait of one of this century's most fascinating artists, an Aretha Franklin as real as the songs she sings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
For the first time anywhere, Aretha tells her story—the glorious triumphs as well as the heartbreaking pain. With refreshing candor, Aretha tells it like it is, the way she sees it, the way she lived it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
A child prodigy of the golden age of gospel, the daughter of a world-famous preacher, Aretha was the anointed successor to Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. But her father had a broader vision and helped Aretha enter the field of pop and jazz. By age eighteen, she was under contract to Columbia Records. Six years later, after only a few minor hits, she switched to Atlantic, where she shook the musical world to its roots. Her song ""Respect"" became the anthem of an epoch, a touchstone for African Americans, for women, for all people struggling to be free. Aretha became the Queen of Soul, the genre's finest interpreter since Ray Charles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In <b>Aretha: From These Roots</b>, the singer gets up-close and personal. In rich detail, she paints a vivid picture of a Detroit long gone: the storefront churches, the basement parties, the explosive R&amp;B shows. She documents her life as a single teenage mother, working to balance home life with career, coping with two challenging marriages and, later, romantic relationships that were the source of both tremendous joy and unforeseen heartache.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Along the way, we meet the characters who lit up her life: her charismatic father, the Reverend C. L. Franklin, ""the man with the million-dollar voice""; Sam Cooke, the man of her dreams; her singing sisters, Erma and Carolyn, and her manager-brother, Cecil; her famous colleagues—Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Luther Vandross, and Luciano Pavarotti—as well as some famous rivals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Aretha emerges as a triumphant woman of rare wit, willing to share with us her passion for great music, great food, and great love affairs. Her book does more than illuminate some of the most exciting songs ever sung; it lets you into the heart and mind of the mesmerizing woman who sang them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.2345886672 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",25,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/36/9780375500336.jpg,Success,153,22.3.4

When the Andersons move to a farmhouse in Sherman, New York, in the spring of 1954, fifteen-year-old Tamara and her mother want to settle down and make it home. Sherman begins to work a strange magic on Tamara and her siblings: there's the proselytizing family in the tar-paper house across the street; the dairy cow that becomes a beloved pet; the dead boy who used to live in Tamara's bedroom; her friend Brenda, who teaches her to swear; and Brenda's big brother, Rusty, an irresistible freckle-faced redhead. While Tamara experiences her first real year of happiness, her mother is diagnosed with tuberculosis, forcing her into a sanatorium. Tamara struggles with her desire to stay in Sherman, her fear of losing her mother, and her anger at being left in charge of two younger siblings while her father escapes into the world of his art.</p>

In the thirties, Eleanor becomes even more surprising and multifaceted. A loyal wife, a devoted mother, a woman who courted romance and adventure, Eleanor Roosevelt was America's most compelling, charismatic, and visionary First Lady. She ran a virtual parallel administration that championed civil rights, affordable housing, and a New Deal for women. She took unpopular stands and often countered her husband's policies, particularly concerning racial justice, women's rights, the plight of refugees, and approaches to Fascism and the Spanish Civil War. The book closes in 1938, as Europe moves toward war. This is an unparalleled presentation of a woman whose life was filled with passionate commitment and who struggled for personal fulfillment. It is a book for all readers of American history and politics, and as the New Deal comes under assault today, a book for readers who care about a decent future for all people.",en,,"Height: 20 Inches, Length: 20 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 20 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/63/9780670804863.jpg,Success,68,22.3.4

She is deaf and dumb, but she wasn't born that way. As she turns 40, she realizes that she has been married (since she was 13) to the uncle who raped her when she was five years old. This traumatic revelation triggers her physical disabilities, compelling her to seek refuge in books and letters. Marianna decides to travel after her husband dies and even turns down an attractive marriage proposal in order to be independent for the first time in her life. Maraini's (e.g., Voices, Serpent's Tail, 1997) writing is elegant, and her graphic descriptions of the luxurious life of the aristocracy in sharp contrast to the squalor of the majority living in poverty are quite realistic.
