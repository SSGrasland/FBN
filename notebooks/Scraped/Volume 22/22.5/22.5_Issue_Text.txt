Greetings, FBN suscriber!
This is the test run of FBN's new e-issues.
When you receive this message, please send a message to <eFBN@FemBkNews.com> telling us you
received the introductory message.
As promised in FBN's last issue, we will alternate between print issues and electronic issues, bringing you the
best of words-on-the-printed-page pleasure and real-time news updates in alternating formats.
FBN's first electronic issue should begin coming to you within the week, as soon a our addressing procedures
pass their test runs.
Each electronic "issue" (in this case, Volume 22 Number 5) will be comprised of a number of email postings.
Posts may include news items that would previously have run in FBN's "News" columns, topical book
columns, time-dated information, news flashes, letters to the e-editor, and things that haven't yet occurred to
us!
The posts for each issue will be spread over several months. Our prediction is that you'll receive a cluster of
posts at the "beginning" of each e-issue, then news and information items will be spread of the following
weeks.
Each e-issue will overlap with the following print issue, allowing us to send you the breaking news, weeks (or
months!) before we could get it to you via printed issue.
Each post will be limited to one topic. You may receive several posts in a single day or it may be several
weeks between posts.

Naiad Cuts Back, Bella Blooms
It's inconceivable that Barbara Grier (now 67) would retire and, of cours e, she isn't. She and Donna McBride have spent the
last several years quietly setting the stage for a major transition, includi ng the possibility of selling the press. But, after
interviewing several likely candidates, they didn't find a buyer fully fitt ing their profile for the new owner who could carry
Naiad Press into the next millennium.
Given that closing the press is inconceivable, the Naiad visionaries inven ted a new option: cutting back to a few (four) books
a year and designating an heir- apparent for all of the remaining titles and brand-name Naiad authors.
In November Barbara approached Kelly Smith, who had recently completed a year- long internship at Naiad as part of her
quest to learn the ropes of publishing and launch her own publishing company. The co-owner of the Detroit women's
bookstore, A Woman's Prerogative, Kelly had announced the formation of Bell a Books shortly after her return to Detroit last
June, and the rest is -- or will soon be -- history.
Naiad, beginning in 2000, will publish only four books a year: one book in each of Claire McNab's series and one book each
from Karin Kallmaker and Naiad Web-mistress/visionary Linda Hill. The other 28 or so titles that Naiad would normally
publish will be shifted to Bella Books. All current Naiad authors have been invited to sign contracts with Bella and, as of this
writing, most have accepted. Bella will launch its first six books this Fall and plans to publish 14 titles in 2001, and expand to
24 titles a year as quickly as possible.
"It's a feminist thing from the 70s," Barbara told FBN. "No money is changing hands, all of the books and authors will have
homes and will be well taken care of, and the books will continue to be there for the readers and in the bookstores."
Bella, in part on Barbara's advice, will do some things differently, including farming out distribution to LPC, though it will
continue to keep individual orders in house. Bella's vision is also different.
"There are many things Barbara and I agree on," Kelly told FBN, "But one thing we don't agree on is the content of the
books: I prefer a more complex novel. Bella will have a more involved editorial process. We've built in more time for
editorial work and for the authors have as much time to rewrite as they need to tell the whole story: to round out character
and plot, etc." Part of the reason for the gap between Naiad's normal publishing schedule and Bella's launch is to allow time
for that process. Bella's other acquisitions include a first novel by Bonnie Morris (Eden Built by Eves) and a mystery by
Nikki Baker. Both will appear in Spring 2001. As of this writing, Bella has already raised half of the money for its launch.
Bella's first titles are scheduled for September, 2000.
All in all, it's a brilliant plan for shifting both legacy and responsibility for a major feminist/ lesbian institution from one
generation to another.
But while the majority of authors and forthcoming titles are shifting to Bella, Naiad will continue to own and sell all the
backlist titles and will continue to publish (at least) four books a year and do some video sales as well. nt like power, as
everyone knows," Barbara deadpans, "And this way I get to keep my hand in. If I had sold the press outright, I wouldn't get to
do that." This was a telephone interview, but you know that look: Barbara Grier likes to do what she wants, and she wants to
do many many things, including publishing books that are important and massaging and promoting the backlist. ( Thanks to
Mr. Ripley's success in the movie houses, we sold 2000 copies of Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt last month," she
elaborated.)

But it's also clear that Barbara intends to keeping Naiad flourishing, albeit on a smaller scale, for another decade. "We want
to cut our work hours down to 40 or 45 hours a week and to leave the office each day before dark," she says, and then

Mysteries
By Nan Cinnater
Now Voyager/Provincetown, MA
Wow! Boldly going, as usual, where no man [sic] has gone before, FBN leaps into the new millennium! It’s been a
long time between columns and the mystery world waits for no woman, so let's catch up.
Among the most anticipated mysteries of the season is Night Work by Laurie R. King, latest in her series about
lesbian detective Kate Martinelli of the San Francisco P.D. With her relationship on the mend, Kate is free to
concentrate on murder. The victim is an abusive husband found zapped by a stun gun, handcuffed, and
strangled, with a piece of candy in his pocket. ($23.95 cl, 0-553-10713-5, Bantam.) Previous books in the series
are Grave Talent, To Play the Fool, and With Child. This is a series best read in order, so it might be worthwhile to
invest in a prepack with three hardcovers and six backlist paperbacks (0-553-66766-1, Bantam). King’s most
recent paperback is the stand-alone novel A Darker Place, about theology professor Anne Waverly, who consults
on cults for the FBI. Here she goes undercover to infiltrate a British cult called “Change.” Anne is another of King’s
superbly complicated, enigmatic heroines, but the novel as a whole didn’t work for me. Nevertheless, King’s great
writing and important themes make it a must-carry. ($6.50, 0-553-57824-3, Bantam.)
Increasingly over the last few years, February books have come to include mysteries and thrillers by African
American women (yay!). Better yet, some of these books are published outside of the February “ghetto.” Grace F.
Edwards’ series about ex-cop-turned-grad student Mali Anderson is most notable for its vibrant Harlem
background history, culture, and street life. In Do or Die, the fourth book in the series, the action is divided
between a brief trip on the QE2 (apparently a romantic interlude where Mali “fights for her man”) and murder ina
Harlem jazz band. It happens to be Mali’s father’s band, and the victim is the singer, the daughter of another band
member. Family and friendship ties require Mali to investigate. ($22.95 cl, 0-385-49248-0, June, Doubleday.)
Newest paperback in this series is No Time to Die, in which Mali finds a newly divorced friend dead in her
apartment, apparently the victim of a serial killer. ($5.99 pb, 0-553-57956-8, Bantam.) Edwards’ previous
paperbacks are A Toast Before Dying ($5.99, 0-553-57953-3) and If | Should Die ($5.99, 0-553-57631-3).
Former Naiad author Penny Mickelbury scored in the mainstream with One Must Wait, now in paperback. African
American defense attorney Carole Anne Gibson and her corporate lawyer husband decide to quit their jobs
because their principles are being compromised. On her husband's last day, he is murdered in an apparent
mugging. Carole Anne investigates, uncovering a criminal conspiracy that stretches from D.C. to Louisiana. Cover
blurb from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says, “Intelligent and evocative. A novel sure to raise the bar on legal
thrillers.” ($6.50, 0-312-97186-9, St. Martin’s.) Mickelbury’s follow-up is The Step Between, in which Carole Anne
is now a private investigator. A routine surveillance job results in three murders and the kidnapping of her
partner's wife. ($22 cl, 0-684-85990-4, Simon & Schuster.)
African American poet Charlotte Carter, author of the jazzy and innovative mystery Rhode Island Red ($6.99 pb,
0-446-60664-2, Warner), has a new paperback, Coq au Vin. Here sax player Nanette Hayes travels to Paris to
find her beloved Aunt Vivian, who has disappeared. The Detroit Free Press said, “A witty, erotic, and moving love
song to Paris and its glamorous Black past.” ($6.50, 0-446-60787-8, Warner.) In Drumsticks, third in the series,
Nanette is back in New York City, trying to get over her ex-boyfriend with the help of a voodoo doll from a friend.
($22.95 cl, 0-89296-679-3, Warner.)
Veteran African American mystery writer Eleanor Taylor Bland has two new entries in her series about middle-
aged mom and Illinois cop Marti MacAlister: Tell No Tales ($5.99 pb, 0-312-97113-3, St. Martin’s), and Scream
in Silence ($23.95 cl, 0-312-20378-0, St. Martin's).
Paula L. Woods, editor of the excellent anthology of black crime fiction, Spooks, Spies, and Private Eyes, has her
own debut mystery out in trade paper from Ballantine. Inner City Blues introduces African American detective
Charlotte Justice of the LAPD in the midst of the Los Angeles riots. The Los Angeles Times said, “Fast-paced,
more twisted than a pretzel...as much about race and racism in L.A. as it is about crime.” $12, 0-345-43793-4.
Other Spring notables include the new Kate Shugak mystery by Dana Stabenow, Midnight Come Again. Aleut
private investigator Kate Shugak is hiding out in a small fishing village when she becomes involved with Russian
smugglers. ($23.95 cl, 0-312-20596-1, May, St. Martin's.) The previous Kate Shugak mystery, Hunter’s Moon, Is

already out in paper. ($6.99, 0-425-17259-7, Berkley.) Stabenow’s eye for the details of Alaskan culture is
unbeatable, and Kate is a great heroine. Stabenow also has two books out in another series, featuring Alaskan
State Trooper Liam Campbell (the paperback Fire and Ice and hardcover So Sure of Death), but | prefer the fiery
maverick Kate.
| loved Nevada Barr’s new paperback, Liberty Falling, partly because | love the setting. Park ranger Anna
Pigeon is on leave to be with her sick sister in New York City and is bunking with a fellow ranger on Liberty Island.
She also spends a lot of time on partially restored Ellis Island, where the haunted feel of the abandoned buildings
passed through by thousands of souls is reflected in some strange goings on. Then a girl falls from the top of the
Statue of Liberty, and Anna has a hunch her death is not accidental. Barr's mix of character, action, and gorgeous
nature writing is in perfect balance here. The book is well paced, the mystery is intriguing, and we finally get to
meet Anna’s sister, albeit not at her best. ($6.99, 0-380-72827-3, Twilight/Avon.) For anyone who missed it, Barr's
first novel, Bittersweet, not a mystery but a lush lesbian Western, is back in print in trade paper. ($13.50, 0-380-
79950-2, Bard.)
The latest in Margaret Maron’s series about Southern judge Deborah Knott is Storm Track, coming in cloth from
Warner in April. ($22.95, 0-892-96656-4.) Maron's new paperback, Home Fires Burning, brings the problem of
race prejudice home when Deborah's own nephew is suspected of torching an African American church. ($6.50,
0-446-60810-5, April, Warner.)
Tami Hoag’s latest gritty thriller, Ashes to Ashes, is on sale in paper in April. $7.99, 0-553-57960-6, Bantam.
For some, the appearance of a new Mrs. Pollifax mystery is cause for rejoicing, and now we have Mrs. Pollifax
Unveiled by Dorothy Gilman, in which the matronly CIA agent searches Syria for a missing American woman.
$23 cl, 0-345-43652-0, Ballantine.
Rita Mae Brown has switched to Ballantine, and her latest, Outfoxed, is the story of murder at a fox hunt. Yes,
there are talking animals, but they aren't cats; they are foxes and hounds. $24 cl, 0-345-42818-8.
That master of the British mystery, Ruth Rendell, has a new non-series paperback, A Sight for Sore Eyes, and
her trademark creepy psychological suspense has never been better. ($6.50, 0-440-23544-8, Dell.) The Black
Lizard imprint of Vintage Books is reissuing her classic suspense novels in trade paper, so perhaps fans of
Minette Walters and Elizabeth George will discover the Grand Master. Titles in the series so far (each $11): A
Demon in My View (0-375-70491-4), A Judgement in Stone (0-375-70496-5), Murder Being Once Done (0-
375-70488-4), No More Dying Then (0-375-70489-2), and Some Lie and Some Die (0-375-70490-6). Rendell’s
recent hardcover, Harm Done, far less creepy because it features decent, thoughtful Inspector Wexford, is her
meditation on the causes and consequences of domestic violence. ($24, 0-609-60547-X, Crown.)
Chris Rogers continues her hardboiled series about Texas bounty hunter Dixie Flanagan with Chill Factor.
($23.95 cl, 0-553-10661-9, Bantam.) Her new paperback is Rage Factor ($5.99, 0-553-58070-1, Bantam) and
she debuted with Bitch Factor ($5.99 pb, 0-553-58001-9). Although Dixie is an appealing character outspoken
and funny | had the same reaction to Bitch Factor that | have to “buddy” action movies: all that raucous rough
stuff becomes boring.
Although it sounds gimmicky, Margaret Lawrence’s series about psychic private investigator Elizabeth Chase
began with a fresh and believable first novel, Murder in Scorpio, that was much nominated for mystery awards.
She is now on her fourth in the series, and may be reaching the critical mass necessary to find her audience. In
Aquarius Descending, Elizabeth infiltrates a dangerous cult. ($5.99 pb, 0-312-97284-9, St. Martin’s.) In Pisces
Rising, she investigates murder in a Native American casino, in the process learning about life and business on
the rez. ($23.95 cl, 0-312-20298-9, St. Martin’s.) If you’re serious about the series, you may want to carry Murder
in Scorpio ($5.50 pb, 0-312-95984-2) and The Cold Heart of Capricorn ($5.99 pb, 0-312-96294-0), as well.

Spring legal thrillers include Moment of Truth by Lisa Scottoline, about an inexperienced woman lawyer whose

John Grisham, Scottoline has become very popular in our store. Long-time sf and mystery writer Kate Wilhelm
has an excellent series about Oregon attorney Barbara Holloway, the latest of which is No Defense. ($24.95 cl, 0-

22592-2, Dell) and The Tidal Poole ($22.95 cl, 0-385-33284-X, Delacorte), with detection by Elizabeth Tudor
herself, just before and just after she is crowned Queen of England.
Anne Perry remains the queen of Victorian mysteries, and her latest is Half Moon Street, featuring Inspector
Thomas Pitt and his wife Charlotte in a mystery involving a cross-dressed corpse and the new art of photography.
($25 cl, 0-345-43327-0, April, Ballantine.) Victoria Thompson is on her second in a “Gaslight Mystery” series that
seems to have much of the same feminist appeal as Perry’s books. Thompson’s heroine is Sarah Brandt, a
midwife in New York City circa 1900. Murder on St. Mark’s Place ($5.99 pb, 0-425-17361-5, Berkley) is the
sequel to Murder on Astor Place ($5.99, 0-425-16896-4, Berkley), which sold well for us. If you have enough
Victorian mystery fans, you may want to carry The Death of Colonel Mann by Cynthia Peale. The sleuths are
brother and sister Addington and Caroline Ames, Boston Brahmins in reduced circumstances, who investigate the
murder of a blackmailing scandal-sheet publisher. Peale is the pseudonym of Nancy Zaroulis, author of the very
feminist historical novel Call the Darkness Light among others. ($22.95 cl, 0-385-49636-2, Doubleday.)
Moghul Buffet by Cheryl Benard is another in Soho Press's list of offbeat, international mysteries. This one
involves the disappearance of an American businessman in Peshawar, Pakistan. “In a country where half the
population is hidden beneath chadors, tracking a murderer can be difficult.” $12 tp, 1-56947-179-7.
Here are some promising but unknown first mysteries. Jackpot Justice by Marilyn Wooley won the St. Martin's
Malice Domestic first novel award. Wooley is a clinical psychologist and so is her heroine, who does her first
forensic evaluation on a young Native American accused of hate violence in a northern California town. ($24.95
cl, 0-312-25455-5, April, St. Martin's.) Brown-Eyed Girl by Virginia Swift is set in Laramie, Wyoming, where the
heroine, now a professor, used to sing in bars. This is described in the catalogue as “Fanny Flagg meets Barbara
Vine.” | kid you not. ($24 cl, 0-06-019555-X, April, Harper.)
The Fig Eater, first novel by magazine editor Jody Shields, takes us to Vienna in 1910, where an 18-year-old girl
is murdered. The wife of the police inspector, along with a teenage governess, secretly investigates. The wife,
who's Hungarian, relies on gypsy folklore as well as police procedures to help find the murderer. This looks
interesting, in an A.S. Byatt-meets-Caleb Carr kind of way. ($23.95 cl, 0-316-78564-4, April, Little Brown.) The
medieval mystery Fortune Like the Moon by Alys Clare introduces a new female sleuth in the increasingly
crowded field competing with Ellis Peters’ Brother Cadfael. A nun is murdered at Hawkenlye Abbey in Kent. The
formidable Abbess of Hawkenlye teams up with a soldier of fortune sent by King Richard to solve the crime.

Gay Literature
By Richard Labonté
A Different Light Bookstores
Every few months, someone interviews me for a story, or asks me while I’m working at the counter, or when
discussing his own plans for a book, wonders...about the bust in the boom of gay books.
As 1999 nears its end, I'll agree that the rate of growth in gay-interest books has peaked; but there will be about
as many books published this year as last year and the year before; and while (in regards to gayboy books) the
major publishers are drawing back, the slack is being taken up by Alyson’s growth and by the work of the likes of
Circlet Press, Black Books, Ashekazic Press, Palm Drive Publishing, Painted Leaf, and a few more.
The trend other than alleged shrinkage, though, is that there’s a sharp increase in nonfiction titles; memoirs
continue to be strong, as do sociology/anthropology studies, cultural studies, parenting books, histories, and what
I'd call cute-queer titles (list books, celebrity books, how-to-find-a-man books).
So while the 40 or so titles selected for your winter delectation are split pretty evenly between fiction and
nonfiction, | selected just 20 percent or so of the potential nonfiction titles for this column, but nearly half of the
interesting fiction. Seems we're in a phase of self-examination....
And there are no asterisks (*) denoting the picks of the picks these are all titles that will nicely augment a gay
male section in a good woman’s bookstore.
Fiction
Comfort & Joy by Jim Grimsley It’s a rare writer who gets to grow with one publisher these days, but the author
of Dream Boy, Winter Birds, and My Drowning, all Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill titles, is bucking a trend,
beautifully; this book's about Ford, spawn of an old rich Savannah family; his love for Danny, a trailer-park
escapee grown into a hospital administrator; and how disparate families cope with unexpected news at
Christmas. $21.95 cl, 1-56512-250-X, Algonquin/Workman.
Innuendo by RD Zimmerman The fifth in Minneapolis author Zimmerman’s Todd Mills series, featuring a TV
investigative journalist and his homicide detective boyfriend, tackles the mystery of the death of an A-list actor in
town to make a movie; was he killed because he was queer? $21.95 cl, 0-385-32377-8, Bantam Doubleday Dell.
Outburst by RD Zimmerman Paper edition of the previous Todd Mills tale, a good addition to any store's mystery

Little Sister’s Gets Its Day in Court
Little Sister’s is getting its day in court today the Supreme Court of Canada. It’s the latest stop in the Vancouver gay/lesbian
bookstore’s fight against Canada Customs and Customs’ censorship of gay and lesbian materials (including books Customs
thinks are gay but aren't) and its practice of targeting shipments bound for gay and lesbian bookstores while letting the same
titles when addressed to general bookstores into the country.
Little Sisters has been actively fighting Customs in the courts for 14 years. In 1998, the British Columbia Court of Appeals
voted two-to-one to uphold Customs’ censorship practices. But the dissenting judge, Justice Lance Finch, found the
legislation upholding those practices to be constitutionally vague. And that’s the issue that Little Sister’s is bringing before
the Court.
Little Sister’s manager Janine Fuller said, “We believe that Canadians can be trusted to make up their own minds about what
they choose to read. We are confident that finally Canada will join the rest of the free world by getting rid of this antiquated
censorship law.”
Other groups intervening on behalf of Little Sister’s are The BC Civil Liberties Association (which is co-filing the
complaint), PEN Canada, LEAF, EGALE, the Canadian Conference on the Arts, the Canadian AIDS Society, and the
Canadian Civil Liberties Union.

the books would do better in stores with a more academic audience. If a title is unrated, it means that I haven’t seen the book
in order to make an evaluation.
Well, normally I won't be writing a column for the email version of FBN, but during this transition period, many interesting

Perhaps pointed more toward professionals in the field rather than toward women looking for self-help, Getting Out: Life
Stories of Women Who Left Abusive Men by Ann Goetting chronicles the lives of 16 women and examines the abuse they
experienced, the life histories that led to the abuse, and the various resources they drew upon to escape. Goetting’s
perspective is clear, “...battering takes two: a man and a patriarchy.” She raises provocative issues regarding abuse and
disagrees with the argument that there exists a comparable problem of battered men. $24.95 cl, 0-231-11648-9. **

Quick. How many contemporary women historians can you name off the top of your head? Uhhh...Gerda Lerner, Linda
Kerber, hmmm. Well, if you’re looking for graduation gift ideas or something unusual to round out your history section, you
may want to consider Voices of Women Historians: The Personal, the Political, the Professional edited by Eileen Boris
and Nupur Chaudhuri. This volume records the life paths of some 20 women who have become historians since the 1960s. It
traces their educational experiences, contributions to the field, and struggles to balance professional and political activities
during some difficult times. Unfortunately, though one should not “judge a book by its cover,” the publisher may have done a
disservice to the general appeal of this book by giving it a bland and uninspiring (OK, ugly) cover. $19.95 pb, 0-253-21275-

For this one, though, all I can say is wow what a beautiful book! The Face of Our Past: Images of Black Women from
Colonial America to the Present edited by Kathleen Thompson and Hilary Mac Austin provides amazing photographs

work, resistance, education, play, and so on) not by strict chronology. It’s a wonderful “photo album” and historical reference
work. Don’t let the price stop you! $35 cl, 0-253-33635-X. *

Now, don’t be tempted to dismiss this book as “regional.” In many ways it speaks to common experiences among women in

utility. Carlson was one of four women hired after the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. This memoir, sometimes
humorous, tells the story of how women and men learned to work together and go beyond stereotypes. $15.95 pb, 0-87351-

Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for health problems like AIDS, STDs, breast cancer, etc.? Lesbian Health: Current
Assessment and Directions for the Future edited by Andrea Solarz for the Institute of Medicine looks at the political
pressures, community attitudes, and professional concerns affecting the study of lesbian health issues. It discusses how to
determine which questions to ask about sexual orientation, the need to obtain information without violating privacy, the
importance of considering racial and ethnic diversity in the study of lesbians, and mechanisms for supporting greater numbers
of researchers. This book will be of most use to professionals rather than casual readers but is still important, as there are so
few books which directly address lesbian health issues. $19.95 pb, 0-309-06567-4; $34.95 cl, -06093-1.***

photographs by Gigi Kaeser and edited by Peggy Gillespie is a beautiful book in which families open their lives, reveal their
hardships, and exhibit clear pride and love in their variety of family constellations and relationships. This is a book of
courage and joy. $40 pb, 0-55849-161-9. *

In The Interrogation of Joan of Arc, Karen Sullivan challenges the transcripts of the trial for heresy of Joan of Arc.
Historical scholars have taken the transcripts as Joan’s testimony and belief, but Sullivan believes that what appeared in the
transcripts was actually a collaboration of sorts between the clerics recording the trial and Joan’s testimony. She identifies the
construct of the trial as being one of the clerics’ making; therefore its language and nuance was determined by them, not by
this uneducated girl from Orleans. $16.95 pb, 0-8166-3268-5.

With My Own Eyes: A Lakota Woman Tells Her People’s History by Susan Bordeaux Bettelyoun and Josephine
Waggoner tells the story of Bettelyoun (18571945) who became increasingly unsatisfied with the way her people’s history
was being represented by non-Natives. She narrated this history to Waggoner (another historian) in the 1930s. This is the first
publication of this history. $14.95 pb, 0-8032-6164-3.*

American Indian Grandmothers: Traditions and Transitions edited by Marjorie Schweitzer includes nine essays that
blend documentary history, oral history, and ethnographic observation to understand the complex world of grandmothering in
Native America. As one might suspect, the commonality of experience continues to vary from tribe to tribe (seven are
covered in this book), from generation to generation, and within changing late 20th-century economic and sociological
factors. In the end, although often impoverished and marginalized, Indian grandmothers provide a vital connection to Native
identity, history, and wisdom. $19.95 pb, 0-8263-2078-3; $45 cl, -2077-5. **

How much of our behavior is based on our own personal psyche and how much is based on cultural forces? Psychoanalytical
perspectives and social science perspectives argue the extremes of this debate. I know that as I do my political work, this
question often arises for me just why do people act and respond the way they do? Finally, a feminist has taken this question
head-on and confirmed my own sense of it. The Power of Feelings: Personal Meaning in Psychoanalysis, Gender, and
Culture by Nancy Chodorow draws on multidisciplinary experiences as a feminist, a teacher of sociology, and a practicing
analyst. Chodorow articulates a new theory of meaning that celebrates individual uniqueness while recognizing how the
external world of culture and society is drawn into the world of personal feelings. She argues that both culture and personal
feelings create meaning for us. $27.50 cl, 0-300-07959-1.**

Rising Tide Sold to New Owners
By Carol Seajay
Debra Tobin and Brenda Kazen have purchased Rising Tide Press (Tucson AZ). The women, who had been searching for a
business to co-own, spotted an ad in their local feminist/lesbian paper, the Rubyfruit Journal, and decided to plunge into the
world of lesbian publishing.
Despite their newness to publishing, Tobin and Kazen are hitting the ground tunning, publishing Linda Key Silva’s Storm
Rising, the sequel to Tropical Storm, which will quickly be followed by books by Beverly Shearer, Nancy Sanra, and several
others. They’ve put together a manuscript review committee and their goal for this year is to publish 1520 books.
Former owners Alice Frier and Lee Boojamra will stay on for about six months to show Tobin and Kazen the ropes.
“We feel very fortunate to have been able to sell Rising Tide to two such bright and independent and strong women who have
so much energy and enthusiasm for the press and the work energy we no longer have,” Frier told FBN. Frier and Boojamra
started Womankind Bookstore in 1979 and founded Rising Tide Press in 1990. Womankind was originally a storefront
bookstore on Long Island, but was later converted to a very successful mail-order bookstore focused on lesbian books. Lee
and Alice sold Womankind to Linda Bronmer, the publisher of Rubyfruit Journal, last July.
Rising Tide’s address, phone and fax remain the same: 3831 N. Oracle Road, Tucson AZ 85705; 520-888-1140, fax 520-888-
1123. The email address is <mileston@ egapterwaey.snest> . <www.risingtidepress.com> is currently under construction.
New and backlist Rising Tide titles will continue to be available from BP, Koen, Alamo, B&T, and Ingram. Direct order
discounts are: 40% for 125 books, 45% for 2649, and 50% for 50+ books.
If you’re going to the Small Press Book Fair in NYC at the end of this month, stop by the Rising Tide booth (B-15) and say
hello to the new owners.

Hollis Sigler (b. 1948) is the daughter and great-granddaughter of women who had breast cancer. She is also a feminist artist
and a lesbian. The paintings and drawings in Hollis Sigler's Breast Cancer Journal, texts by Susan M. Love, M.D., and James
Yood, reflect her responses to the disease since she was diagnosed with it in 1985. It is a complex, moving story, both in
image and word, which many will respond to. $25 pb, 1-55595-176-7; $45 cl, -175-9, Hudson Hills Press, distributed by
National Book Network.

intriguing images. $19.95 pb, 0-8223-2389-3, Duke University Press.

Ten Finalists Chosen for
Book Sense Book of the Year Award
The American Booksellers Association has announced the finalists for the Book Sense Book of the Year award.
The five finalists in each category (children’s titles and adult titles) were culled from last year’s Book Sense 76
lists and write-in votes.
Women’s titles are well represented on the adult list, owing in part to feminist booksellers’ nominations to the lists
throughout 1999. ABA member stores will now vote to select a winner in each category. Ballots will be included in
ABA’s election ballot for the Board of Directors (mailed in March) or are available in Bookselling This Week and at
<www.bookweb.org>. Booksellers will receive “Book Sense of the Year Finalist” stickers soon to help sell these
titles.
Among the finalists are, for children’s books, the fabulous Amelia and Eleanor Go for a Ride by Pam Munoz Ryan
(Scholastic) see FBN's “Raves” column, Fall 1999, for a review. For adults, there’s the runaway indie hit Girl in
Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland (MacMurray & Beck), Ahab’s Wife by Sena Jeter Naslund (Morrow), and The
Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver (HarperCollins).
The two winners, each to be awarded $5,000, will be announced at BEA 2000 in Chicago.

Music News
Compiled and edited by Susan Frazier, Goldenrod Music Inc.
Original reviews by Susan Frazier, Melinda Pierce, and Brenda Fite
Last fall was a great time for music as a sideline in women’s bookstores. With strong releases from the major
labels and independents alike including new releases from bestselling artists Melissa Etheridge, Ani DiFranco,
the Indigo Girls, Ferron, and SONIA of disappear fear sales were decidedly brisk! And there are some big names
and lots of great music to choose from this spring.
There is something for everyone in the current crop of new releases. Fine world, Celtic, country, Native American,
Cajun, and R&B titles take their place alongside the folk and pop genres.
Quiet/Sheila Chandra. A spellbinding fusion of Chandra’s wordless vocals and instrumentation in ten richly
textured, ambient soundscapes. This is a reissue of her composing debut on the innovative Indipop label. The
album's strikingly different approach no lyrics and cyclic riffs instead of rock/dance percussion is a prelude to
Chandra’s work on Real World Records. Narada 48621.
Telling Stories/Tracy Chapman. This new recording by the Grammy Awardwinning women’s music favorite,
Tracy Chapman, was released in February. Chapman produces this one with help from David Kershenbaum and
adds more instrumentation than on her previous recordings. Telling Stories includes eleven new tracks
showcasing Chapman's heart-wrenching lyrics and sultry vocals. Emmylou Harris lends a hand with vocals on
Chapman's song “The Only One,” which deals with grief over the loss of a lover. Chapman will be on the road
with a full band through 2000 to promote this one. Elektra 62478.
The Very Best of Rita Coolidge: Millennium Collection/Rita Coolidge. This new best-of collection will certainly
bring back memories! Digitally remixed from the original master tapes, this new CD features all the covers
Coolidge made hits in the 70s and 80s. Included are Carole King/The Chiffon’s “One Fine Day,” Boz Scaggs
“We're All Alone,” The Temptations’ “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” and Coolidge’s signature track, Jackie
Wilson’s “(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher and Higher.” Also included is a duet with Kris Kristofferson of Loving
Arms. Sell this one to Rita Coolidge fans along with the new recording Unbearable Love by her trio Walela. A&M
490604.
Rogue Amazon/Juliet Draper and Pam Jones. Pam Jones said of her new CD single and Juliet Draper, “I love
my sister, but... Move over Grace Jones, here comes Juliet!” Garnering a four-star review in Dance Music
Authority, the album features the title track and a remake of Grace Jones’ “I Need a Man” (one for the girls, one
for the boys!). The remixes are taking off in the hippest clubs in France and Germany expect the American clubs
to catch on soon. Rogue Amazon 1.
On How Life Is/Macy Gray. The buzz is in full swing about this debut album from Macy Gray, an artist who is
garnering rave reviews from all the critics. Gray blends many musical genres, including R&B, rap, hip-hop, rock,
and diva-style jazz. J.D. Considine of the Baltimore Sun writes: “Macy Gray is different than most R&B and hip-
hop stylists out there. Her tone and phrasing remind me of Al Green. She has a tartness and playfulness to the
way she sings.” Epic 69490.
Tip of My Tongue/Half Looking. OK, so we're biased because this wonderful new band hails from Lansing, but
don't let that keep you from checking out this rising young group. Think Natalie Merchant, think Ani, think Indigo
Girls or R.E.M. no don't think of them, think Half Looking. Saucy, soul-stirring lyrics combined with edgy, driving
melodies that blur the lines between folk, punk, blues, and jazz make for a fine debut album. Excellent choice for
in-store play. JRR 1248.
Spiritual Appliances/Sara Hickman. Yay, a new one from Sara Hickman! This release shows a new maturity for
Printed for Carol Seajay <seajay @dnai.com> 1/14/2002Carol Seajay, 12:40 PM 3/17/2000 , [eFB-News] Rising Tide Sold Page 2 of 3
Hickman, who takes her witty lyrics and presents them with rich harmony and precise instrumentation. Music
Review Quarterly writes “Sara Hickman should stand alongside Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked, k.d. lang, and
Jane Siberry for jump-starting the women’s folk movement in the late 80s.” Shanachie 8034.
| Am Shelby Lynn/Shelby Lynn. Ten new tracks from a singer with a haunting vocal style who is also a genre
bender. Take country music, add a little blues, blend in some R&B, and season with soul...and you've got a recipe
for Shelby Lynn. Lynn is a singer-songwriter who is pushing the envelope, outgrowing her roots, and risking it all
to find her true niche. Island 546177.
Chers Amis/Magnolia Sisters. An all-woman Cajun band...who can resist? The Magnolia Sisters are made up of
Ann Savoy (a member of the Savoy-Doucet Band, which includes her husband Marc Savoy and Michael Doucet
of Beausolell fame), Tina Piline, Lisa Trahan Reed, Christine Balfi (of Balfa Toujours), and Jane Vidrine. This
album is a lush acoustic mix of traditional ballads and catchy dance tunes. The Sisters are talented
instrumentalists who present tight jams and harmonies. A nice selection for International Women’s Day.
ROUNDER 6070.
Méav/Méav. Méav is a classically trained Irish soprano who has performed with the choral group Antna, The Irish
National Concert Orchestra, and the productions of Riverdance. Her solo effort is an eclectic mix of Celtic and
classical music, featuring ancient and traditional tunes. Speaking of her ability to blend old music and new styles,
Méav says “I don't see it as wacky or anything. It's just another element that can enhance performance and open
things up to a new audience.” Hearts of Space 11098.
Scottish Fire/Bonnie Rideout. Once again, Rideout proves herself an exceptional Scottish fiddler. Scottish Fire
is a refreshing mix of jigs, reels, strathspeys, and airs, featuring Rideout’s champion fiddling and accompaniment
by famous pipers Mike Green and Jerry O'Sullivan. The Glasgow Herald writes, “Her playing is so intensely
personal and emotional that one feels like an eavesdropper.” Maggie’s Music S222.
Nos/Virginia Rodriques. This is the follow-up recording to Rodriques’s So/ Negro, which sold more than 35,000
copies! Nos showcases Rodriques’s vocal range and celebrates the rich cultural music of Carnival in Brazil.
Rodriques embarks on a U.S. tour of the major cities this spring, which includes some double bills with Philip
Glass. Hannibal 1448.
Native North American Child/Buffy Sainte-Marie. A re-issue of one of Sainte-Marie’s earlier releases, the first of
many to come from Vanguard. This CD features two previously unreleased tracks, “Way, Way, Way” and
“IskatayoSawow (Cree Call).” Vanguard 79340.
Peacemaker’s Journey/Joanne Shenandoah. Let’s hope Shenandoah’s CD Peacemaker’s Journey can be
successful in bringing the Iroquois prophecy of peace around the world. A brand-new release from this Nammy
award winner, featuring original compositions sung in her native language, Iroquois. Guitar, bass, and a wealth of
strings are added to this musical story, which chronicles the Peacemaker, who brought peace to the Iroquois
Nations. Highly recommended! Silver Wave 923.
Permanent Marker/Ember Swift. “Aggressive folk” is one of the descriptions given to the music created by
Toronto-based singer Ember Swift. Swift and her band perform an energetic mix of folk, punk, and rock and add
some great political and social messages along with it. Permanent Marker has some tracks that are certainly Ani-
esque, but for the most part it plays like a modern rock/punk opera. Expect to see her touring extensively both in
the U.S. and Canada. EMS 9906.
Paradise Road/Lindsay Tomasic. This Michigan native (now living in California) has an impressive musical
resume. Tomasic is the composer of many TV promos, trailers, and themes including the theme song for The
Roseanne Show. She has worked with Lauren Wood, Liz Phair, and Vicki Randle, and she has a smooth vocal
style reminiscent of Deidre McCalla. Her latest CD, Paradise Road, is largely autobiographical with interesting
stories of hometown life. Great for in-store play! Datolite Records 1.
Faire Celts: A Woman’s Voice/Various Artists. Another great compilation of women’s Celtic music from the folks
that brought us Celtic Voices: Women of Song several years back. This year’s rendition features Connie Dover,
Sinead O’Connor, Karen Matheson (Capercaillie), Kim Robertson, and Mairéad Ni Mhaonaigh of Altan. Also
includes a beautiful version of “A Woman's Heart” by Mary McLaughlin. Narada 48733.

Allow me to apologize profusely for forgetting to include Through Alien Eyes by Amy Thompson in
the last column. It’s the sequel to The Color of Distance, and it continues Thompson’s wonderful
exploration of first contact between humans and Tendu. In the new book, two Tendu travel with Juna
(who had been stranded on their planet in the first book) back to Earth. As in the first book, the Tendu’s
ecologically focused perspective continually calls into question human relationships with the rest of our
biosphere. Often these questions reveal human shortsightedness regarding the environment, but the
Tendu also reconsider their own priorities on occasion. ($13.95 tp, 0-441-00617-5.) The Color of
Distance. ($6.50 pb, 0-441-00632-9; $13, tp, -00244-7.)

uncle usurped her father’s rule and invaded her mother’s realm. She was raised by the Brothers of
Blessed Reason, her existence kept secret from her family’s enemies. She learned skills most women
were never taught reading, writing, and mathematics but yearned to be a warrior. When she left the
monastery, she ventured into the world that was under her uncle’s dictatorship, ready to reclaim her
land. With the aid of the lone defender Kerric of Myro, she would lead a small fighting force in an
attempt to topple a tyrant...and set the people of two lands free. $22.95 cl, 0-441-00650-7.

Like her previous work, Avalanche Soldier by Susan R. Matthews explores the struggle of obedience,
honor, and faith among career military personnel. As a member of the elite paramilitary force, Salli is
responsible for protecting the religious shrines scattered throughout the mountainous wilderness regions
of the troubled state of Shadene. As a devout member of the Orthodox Dreaming, she freely accepts, as
part of her faith, that life is a dream and that true believers will one day be awakened by the coming
Messiah. But there is another faith on Shadene that preaches heresy, and its existence has sparked
horrific acts of terrorism and civil unrest. Suddenly Salli’s life has been ripped in two. Her brother

vanished under a cloud of suspicion is believed to have embraced the false religion. As a soldier sworn
to safeguard Orthodox interests, Salli must track him down and return him to the fold. But as a disciple
of the one true Messiah, she must confront the crisis that now assaults her conscience and her creed. For
there is a woman in the enemy enclave who inspires fervent devotion a personage of great power who
impossibly, yet undeniably, shows signs of being the prophesied One. $6.50 pb, 0-380-80315-1.
The Arthurian saga is one of the most enduring legends of Western civilization a stirring tale of destiny,
duty, faith, and majesty that has been told and retold by some of the greatest storytellers of all time. In
her sweeping four-volume work The Hallowed Isle, acclaimed author Diana L. Paxson brilliantly
reinvents the classic myth by reimagining the great king, his life, and his legacy from the unique
perspectives of four distinct tribal cultures that shaped Britain in the violent days of the sixth century.

Mary Gentle’s latest work is a four-volume novel of alternate history, focusing on Ash, a female
mercenary and war leader in 15th-century Burgundy. The Book of Ash is presented as a 21st-century
translation of previously unknown medieval documents that tell of a conflict between Europe and a
North African empire. In addition to the battles and action, Gentle also explores broader questions,
including slavery, gender roles, ethics, and the relations between fiction, myth, history, and truth. The
first two volumes are currently in print; the last two will follow in August and November. The Book of
Ash #1: A Secret History ($6.99 pb, 0-380-78869-1) and The Book of Ash #2: Carthage Ascendant

The Annunciate by Severna Park. ThreeSys is a triple star system where people are divided into three
classes Meshed, Jacked, and Jackless a caste system based on technological access. Three of the
Meshed begin to distribute what they claim is an end to all wars and aggression. What they’re actually
selling is Staze, an opium-like, instantly addictive drug that wraps the user in dreams and lethargy. In
response, some Jacked and Jackless have retaliated against this and other abuses of power, mercilessly
hunting down and killing Meshed humans. In an attempt to save themselves, the three Meshed drug
distributors go in search of the Annunciate, a mysterious, enigmatic being who offers the elusive
promise of a new world clean of sin and violence. This may not actually turn out to be a good thing. $23

Kathleen Ann Goonan’s third novel of nanotechnology and music, Crescent City Rhapsody, is more
prequel than sequel to the first two (Queen City Jazz and Mississippi Blues) and fills in the gaps to
explain how the world of the Nan Queen came to be. $23 cl, 0-380-97711-7.
Bantam Spectra
Published for the first time in a single volume, Biting the Sun, Tanith Lee’s duet of novels set in a
hedonistic Utopia, are as riveting and revolutionary as they were when they first appeared two decades
ago. It’s a perfect existence, a world in which no pleasure is off-limits, no risk is too dangerous, and no
responsibilities can cramp your style. But when you’re expected to make trouble when you can kill
yourself on a whim and return in another body, when you’re encouraged to change genders at will and
experience whatever you desire you’ve got no reason to rebel. Ravenous for true adventures of the mind
and body, desperate to find some meaning, one restless spirit finally bucks the system and by shattering
the rules, strikes at the very heart of a soulless society. $5.99 pb, 0-553-58130-9.
In Rift by Kay L. Kenyon, Reeve Calder has spent his life on a high-tech space station, watching as
terraforming gradually fails on his home planet of Lithia a failure that doomed the colonists stranded
1/14/2002
file://C:\DOCUME~1\seajay\LOCALS~ 1\Temp\eud1D1.htmPage 3 of 5
there to short, brutish lives. Reeve’s dream has always been to rebuild Lithia. But when a mysterious
explosion destroys the station, forcing Reeve to crash-land on Lithia’s blood-hued soil, he soon learns
that the reality of saving a dying planet is quite different from what he imagined. His staunchest ally
may be a feral girl who alone seems enthralled by what Lithia is becoming, and whose enigmatic past
holds the key to startling possibilities. $5.99 pb, 0-553-58023-X.
Catherine Asaro’s The Veiled Web is a departure from her previous space opera series but retains close
connections to the romance genre, something to be expected from all Asaro’s work. Set in the early 21st
century, the novel combines the worlds of dance, artificial intelligence, the net, and a respectful if not
deep exploration of harem culture (strict segregation of women within a family from the outside world).
The combination doesn’t always work well, tending toward a shift from one topic to the next rather than
full integration. I would recommend this book to readers of historical fantasy/romance who might be
wary of cyberpunk; it’s a good introduction to some SF concepts like the Internet and artificial
intelligence but it’s mostly old hat for regular SF readers.

C.J. Cherryh has written the beginning of a brand new trilogy set in her Foreigner Universe! In

Barbara Hambly follows up on her popular novels Dragonsbane and Dragonshadow by revealing the
damaging aftereffects of that quest in Knight of the Demon Queen. Once the most powerful mage in
the land, Jenny Waynest is now a broken woman. Though sickened by the memory of how the demon
had possessed her body to slake his sadistic lusts, she knows a part of her was corrupted by his touch.
That part mourns the demon’s defeat and longs for his return, though he has already cost her everything
she holds dear: the trust of her husband, Lord John Aversin; the chance to be a mother to her mage-born
son; and the magic that had given her life its purpose. Lord John has torments of his own: memories of
the beautiful and cruel Aohila, demon queen of a rival hell, whom he’d tricked into providing the help
he needed to free Jenny. Now, condemned to death for trafficking with demons, John cannot forgive
Jenny for what she suffered. Nor can he forgive himself for opening the door to a far greater evil. $24

Suzanne Corson
Boadecia’s Books/North Berkeley CA
Tor
Pat Murphy has a new book the first in a planned trilogy called There and Back Again. Pat describes
it as “hobbits in space.” I also detected a little Dorothy in its themes of home. Pat’s usual fine writing
and tight plotting make this a pleasure to read. For true science fiction fans, Pat’s science background
and work at the Exploratorium make her science fiction not infuriating to the science-minded. (The
gimmick is that this space opera is written by Max Merriwell, a planned sequel pretty much already
written will be by Mary Maxwell, and the final volume in the trilogy will be by Pat Murphy.) Although
hobbits are rather desexed, Murphy manages to include and imply a lot of dyke sex. And as a founding
mother of the Tiptree Award, Pat managed to avoid Tolkien’s sexist and racist tendencies. $24.95 cl, 0-
312-86644-5.
Sea Dragon Heir by Storm Constantine is the start of a new series. It’s fantasy with enough self-
consciousness to critique the genre’s mythic patterns and processes so that human motivations are also
given responsibility for the outcome. As with all her work, Constantine continues to explore the
interworkings of politics, sexuality, and individuality. $24.95 cl, 0-312-87306-9.
Isobelle Carmody’s Obernewtyn is the first book in a series (previously published in Australia) about a
young woman with telepathic powers caught in a society fearful of technology and “mutants” such as
herself. Once she is sent to the labor camp for other such “Misfits,” she learns of the possibility of
rebellion and the chance that somewhere else the old knowledge may still be learned. $22.95 cl, 0-312-
86958-4.
The Merlin of St. Gilles’ Well by Ann Chamberlin Book One of the Joan of Arc Tapestries a retelling
of Joan of Arc with goddess flavor. $23.95 cl, 0-312-86551-1.
Rhapsody by Elizabeth Haydon first in a new fantasy series (which has been optioned for film, by the
way). $24.95 cl, 0-312-86752-2.
Household Gods by Judith Tarr and Harry Turtledove is about a modern woman transferred back in
time to a Roman town in A.D. 170. Tarr writes great historical novels, and Turtledove is also known for
his realistic alternative history. Both are scholars and have advanced degrees in medieval Latin literature
and history, respectively. $27.95 cl, 0-312-86487-6.

Little Sister's and the Supreme Court of Canada
We spoke briefly with Little Sister's manager Janine Fuller about the bookstore’s appearance in the Supreme
Court of Canada last week. This case was the latest in the bookstore’s 14-year battle with Canada Customs’ over
its discriminatory censorship practices.
Fuller said that the case went well. “We had a great cross-section of people interviewing on our behalf,” she said,
referring to PEN Canada, LEAF, EGALE, the Canadian Conference on the Arts, the Canadian AIDS Society, and
the Canadian Civil Liberties Union, who testified for Little Sister's. Each organization had only 15 minutes in which
to testify, but they did beautifully according to Fuller. “They were all very eloquent speakers,” she said.
Fuller went on to say that the Court has some new justices, and she got the impression that they were
understanding the complexities of the case and the ways in which Customs’ practices undermine Canadians’ free
speech rights.
“I think we will get some kind of relief as a result of this,” she said. “And | don’t think I’m being naive.”
The Court will deliver its decision in three to twelve months.

Suzy McKee Charnas Wins the 1999 Tiptree Award
The winner of this year’s Tiptree Award is The Conqueror’s Child by Suzy McKee Charnas (Tor), the final volume
of the Holdfast Chronicles. The Chronicles follow Alldera, a woman who has escaped from the Holdfast society,
where the women are slaves and the men are brutalized monsters. The Conqueror’s Child chronicles the
formation of a new society on the ruins of the Holdfast culture.

wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree, Jr., in the bad old days when science fiction writers had to
write under men’s names to get any attention.
