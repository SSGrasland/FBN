0-8147-3123-6,Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out,"Griffin, Sean P.",NYU Press,292.0,2000-02-01,"Walt Disney Company., Homosexuality and motion pictures, PN1999.W27 G75 2000, 384/.8/06579794",Paperback,"<p>From its Magic Kingdom theme parks to its udderless cows, the Walt Disney Company has successfully maintained itself as the brand name of conservative American family values. But the Walt Disney Company has also had a long and complex relationship to the gay and lesbian community that is only now becoming visible.</p>
<p>In <b>Tinker Belles and Evil Queens</b>, Sean Griffin traces the evolution of this interaction between the company and gay communities, from the 1930s use of Mickey Mouse as a code phrase for gay to the 1990s ""Gay Nights"" at the Magic Kingdom. Armed with first-person accounts from Disney audiences, Griffin demonstrates how Disney animation, live-action films, television series, theme parks, and merchandise provide varied motifs and characteristics that readily lend themselves to use by gay culture. But Griffin delves further to explore the role of gays and lesbians within the company, through an examination of the background of early studio personnel, an account of sexual activism within the firm, and the story of the company's own concrete efforts to give recognition to gay voices and desires.</p>
<p>The first book to address the history of the gay community and Disney, <b>Tinker Belles and Evil Queens</b> broadly examines the ambiguous legacy of how modern consumerism and advertising have affected the ways lesbians and gay men have expressed their sexuality. Disney itself is shown as sensitive to gay and lesbian audiences, while exploiting those same audiences as a niche market with strong buying power. Finally, Griffin demonstrates how queer audiences have co-opted Disney products for themselves-and in turn how Disney's corporate strategies have influenced our very definitions of sexuality.</p>",en,,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches",27.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/39/9780814731239.jpg,Success,11,22.5

But the amazing, dazzling, decorative, poignant, picturesque, inspiring, glowing, passionate altars in this book are not those of churches and temples, designed for the official worship of an omniscient god ceremoniously tended by a priest, rabbi, or minister. Instead, these places are the expression of the most intimate beliefs and fears, memories and dreams of women who are making new spiritual traditions from ancient ones--pagan, goddess, Celtic, Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic, Greek Orthodox. No one knows more about this remarkable efflorescence than Kay Turner, who has been exploring the subject for over twenty years since accidentally encountering the extraordinary altar of a Quiche Maya woman--described by its maker as a ""beautiful necessity""--in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Since then she has gathered abundant evidence of how this phenomenon grips women in the most diverse locations, from the studios of artists in New York, Detroit, and San Francisco to the kitchens of Mexican-American homes in Texas, from Mama Lola celebrating Afro-Caribbean gods in Brooklyn to a Wiccan priestess in California worshiping the goddess Aphrodite. The statues, flowers, pictures, photographs, drawings, amulets, pieces of shell, and bits of earth that are collaged together and reproduced here in color represent their makers' histories, beliefs, and desires. Turner draws out the personal stories that lie behind the altars and explains their appeal and significance for everyone.",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",7.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/05/9780500281505.jpg,Success,18,22.5

<p>""At Mrs. Sugar's""</p>
<p>""Have you heard, my dears? The Hall House is sold at last."" Mrs. Sugar was slicing ham with studied concentration as she made this announcement. The recipient of the meat, a woman with a distant, distracted expression and clothes to match, was more intent on the carving than on the speaker but the other customers crowded into the little shop all responded with satisfying interest.</p>
<p>""Really, Mrs. Sugar?"" exclaimed a woman in jodhpurs and tweed hacking jacket. ""Do we know who?""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry, Mrs. Daltry, that I have so far not been able to ascertain,"" Mrs. Sugar replied with the carefully assumed vowels she saved for her favoured customers. ""My informant, Miss Briggs at Lashams,"" the local estate agent, ""seemed to think that the purchaser was a gentleman from London.""</p>
<p>""Oh Lord! Not another commuter?"" Heather Daltry groaned. ""The village is becoming nothing more than a dormitory. One can scarcely breathe for exhaust fumes between six thirty and eight, morning and evening.""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the woman at the counter was trying to catch the carver's attention.</p>
<p>""That's more than enough,"" she said in an agitated voice.</p>
<p>""I'll just give you this one delicious slice, my dear,"" Mrs. Sugar told her, cutting it extra thick. ""The Brigadier will come back for more tonight, Mrs. Jerrold, I'll be bound. Like Oliver Twist he'll be. And no wonder! My ham is the talk of the county on account of the secret ingredient I put in the water."" As she spoke she was now wrapping the meat in grease proof paper. Then laying the little parcel on the scales she gave them a sharp rap with her clenched fist. ""Drat these scales! They stick, you know.""</p>
<p>Heather Daltry turned andraised her eyes in a way loaded with meaning. The slender woman in a flowing cloak standing behind her frowned.</p>
<p>""You should have them checked, Mrs. Sugar,"" she announced, making a statement rather than a suggestion.</p>
<p>""I've had them checked, Mrs. Simpson,"" Mrs. Sugar replied indignantly. ""A man from the ministry came himself.""</p>
<p>""It's Ms.,"" Diana Simpson said impatiently. ""I've told you that before.""</p>

An unconventional aristocrat who managed to survive the French Revolution, Custine lived openly for most of his life with his partner, Edouard Sainte-Barbe, and wrote a series of unextraordinary books. But after a trip to Russia, he wrote unflinchingly of the fear, violence, and despotism there and thereby achieved fame. Today, many critics consider La Russie en 1839 one of the best books ever written about Russia, offering insights that are both emotional, rational, and prophetic of the Stalin regime. Muhlstein, who won the French Prix Goncourt for this biography in 1996, quotes liberally from Custine's letters and writings, revealing much about the man who became a prominent opponent to abuses of political, social, and moral authority.

<p>The transcripts of Joan of Arc's trial for heresy at Rouen in 1431 and the minutes of her interrogation have long been recognized as our best source of information about the Maid of Orleans. Historians generally view these legal texts as a precise account of Joan's words and, by extension, her beliefs. Focusing on the minutes recorded by clerics, however, Karen Sullivan challenges the accuracy of the transcript. In The Interrogation of Joan of Arc, she re-reads the record not as a perfect reflection of a historical personality's words, but as a literary text resulting from the collaboration between Joan and her interrogators.</p>
<p>Sullivan provides an illuminating and innovative account of Joan's trial and interrogation, placing them in historical, social, and religious context. In the fifteenth century, interrogation was a method of truth-gathering identified not with people like Joan, who was uneducated, but with clerics, like those who tried her. When these clerics questioned Joan, they did so as scholastics educated at the University of Paris, as judges and assistants to judges, and as pastors trained in hearing confessions.</p>
<p>The Interrogation of Joan of Arc traces Joan's conflicts with her interrogators not to differing political allegiances, but to fundamental differences between clerical and lay cultures. Sullivan demonstrates that the figure depicted in the transcripts as Joan of Arc is a complex, multifaceted persona that results largely from these cultural differences. Discerning and innovative, this study suggests a powerful new interpretive model and redefines our sense of Joan and her time.</p>

Most of these were portraits of her adolescent daughters. By whisking away the furniture and bric-a-brac common in scenes of upper-class homes of the Victorian period, Lady Hawarden transformed the sitting room of her London residence into a photographic studio—a private space for taking surprising photos of her daughters in fancy dress. In Carol Mavor’s hands, these pictures become windows into Victorian culture, eroticism, mother-daughter relationships, and intimacy.<br>
	With drama, wit, and verve, Lady Hawarden’s girls, becoming women, entwine each other, their mirrored reflections and select feminine objects (an Indian traveling cabinet, a Gothic-style desk, a shell-covered box) as homoerotic partners. The resulting mise-en-scène is secretive, private, delicious, and arguably queer—a girltopia ripe with maternality and adolescent flirtation, as touching as it is erotic. Luxuriating in the photographs’ interpretive possibilities, Mavor makes illuminating connections between Hawarden and other artists and writers, including Vermeer, Christina Rossetti, George Eliot, Lewis Carroll, and twentieth-century photographers Sally Mann and Francesca Woodman. Weaving psychoanalytic theory and other photographic analyses into her work, Mavor contemplates the <i>experience</i> of the photograph and considers the relationship of Hawarden’s works to the concept of the female fetish, to voyeurism, mirrors and lenses, and twins and doubling. Under the spell of Roland Barthes, Mavor’s voice unveils the peculiarities of the erotic in Lady Hawarden’s images through a writerly approach that remembers and rewrites adolescence as sustained desire.<br>
	In turn autobiographical, theoretical, historical, and analytical, Mavor’s study caresses these mysteriously ripped and scissored images into fables of sapphic love and the real magic of photography.</p>

With her soulful voice and delicate beauty, Starr Hendrix seemed destined to live up to her name and hit it big as a jazz singer. But her career ended before it began, and Mali's father offered Starr a second chance by giving her top billing as singer for his popular jazz band's latest show.

Mali vows to use her experience as a former cop to find the real killer. Her search will take her in and out of the ""three B's"" of Harlem: the beauty shops, barbershops, and the bars.

<p>From her earliest novel, <i>Desert of the Heart</i> (1964), Rule's fiction has provided a challenge to the concept of a fixed identity and to the identity politics founded on such a concept. Incorporating all of Jane Rule's early work-including unpublished manuscripts, letters, magazine and newspaper columns, as well as fan mail she received-Schuster also draws on interviews, conversations, and personal encounters with the author to elicit the ways in which Rule interrogates the meanings and politics of sexuality, the relationship between sexuality and language, and the stakes of communities in individual claims on identity.</p>

Reading these settings performatively, Carol Mavor shifts the focus toward the subjectivity of these girls and women, and toward herself as a writer.<br>
Mavor’s original approach to these photographs emphatically sees sexuality where it has been previously rendered invisible. She insists that the sexuality of the girls in Carroll’s pictures is not only present, but deserves recognition, respect, and scrutiny. Similarly, she sees in Cameron’s photographs of sensual Madonnas surprising visions of motherhood that outstrip both Victorian and contemporary understandings of the maternal as untouchable and inviolate, without sexuality. Finally she shows how Hannah Cullwick, posing in various masquerades for her secret paramour, emerges as a subject with desires rather than simply a victim of her upper-class partner. Even when confronting the darker areas of these photographs, Mavor perseveres in her insistence on the pleasures taken—by the viewer, the photographer, and often by the model herself—in the act of imagining these sexualities. Inspired by Roland Barthes, and drawing on other theorists such as Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, Mavor creates a text that is at once interdisciplinary, personal, and profoundly pleasurable.</p>",en,1st Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 0.81 Pounds, Width: 0.51 Inches",60.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/90/9780822316190.jpg,Success,18,22.5

The title refers to two eponymous parks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem which serve as the gay cruising places. Here, 12 diverse men representing a cross-section of Israeli gay male society (e.g., a male prostitute, a senior citizen, a Russian immigrant, an Arab, and a married man), all of whom have spent time in the parks, recount their life stories. While their tales display commonalities of experience that most gays will recognize, they also reveal Israeli society to be far more secular and tolerant than one might expect. Fink and Press display a dry wit and an ear for translating colloquial speech that makes each man emerge fully. An afterward brings the reader up to date on where they are now, and a glossary is provided.

<p>Straight with a Twist offers a refreshing look at the relation between queer theory and critical examinations of the construction of heterosexuality. Seeking to proliferate the findings and insights of queer theory, contributors explore the issue of whether and how queer theory can speak for and include the straight.</p>
<p>In some of the ways that men have learned from feminism to interrogate the construction of masculinity, straights are learning from queer theory to interrogate constructions of straightness, to question their place in those constructions, and to make critical interventions into the institutional reproduction of the heterosexual norm. Straight with a Twist responds to the formulations of some of the leading figures in queer theory, considers demonstrations of the queer in television programs (""Seinfeld, "" for example) and contemporary films, and explores to what extent and in what ways literary texts from Shakespeare to Dorothy Allison are open to queer interpretation.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.98 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",28.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/33/9780252068133.jpg,Success,15,22.5

By taking as its raison d'etre the fight for gay marriage, gay politics has abandoned its historic fight against the stigmatization of sex. But, as Warner shows, when gays agree to separate their ""sex"" from their ""identity, "" they are only rewarded with oppressive trends like stricter zoning of gay clubs and businesses, the ""Don't Ask/Don't Tell"" policy in the military and, ironically, the ""Defense of Marriage"" act.
<p>Warner presents a piercing and cogent analysis of the politics of shame and the stigma of sexual identity. He offers an alternative ethical vision that proclaims sex is as varied as the people who have it, and honesty and morality are not limited to those with a marriage license.

Yet they still struggle with the bloody instincts that have tormented humanity since time immemorial. ThreeSys is a triangle of stars with eleven planets each, where people are divided into three classes-Meshed, Jacked, and Jackless-a caste system of technological access.

Traveling throughout ThreeSys, the trio devotes their extraordinary abilities to selling what they claim is an end to all wars and aggression.

Yet some Jacked and Jackless have retaliated against this and other abuses of power, mercilessly hunting down and killing Meshed humans.</p>

And soon Wexford is investigating the links between a local girl gone bad and a charismatic singer who inspires an unwholesome devotion in his followers. <b>Some Lie and Some Die</b> is a devilishly absorbing novel, in which Wexford's deductive powers come up against the aloof arrogance of pop stardom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With her Inspector Wexford novels, Ruth Rendell, winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award, has added layers of depth, realism and unease to the classic English mystery. For the canny, tireless, and unflappable policeman is an unblinking observer of human nature, whose study has taught him that under certain circumstances the most unlikely people are capable of the most appalling crimes.</p>",en,English Language,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.46 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",15.0,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/01/9780375704901.jpg,Success,5,22.5

From age four to eighteen, Sue William Silverman was repeatedly sexually abused by her father, an influential government official and successful banker. Through her eyes, we see an outwardly normal family built on a foundation of horrifying secrets that long went unreported, undetected, and unconfessed.</p> <h3>KLIATT</h3> <p>Incest might be one of the most painful subjects to read about, much less experience, and Silverman's memoir is an extraordinary example of this torture. She begins at age four, confused and emotionally wary about the sexual activities that she and her father explore. I found myself closing the book, but unable to rid my mind of the vivid, graphic scenes that are written in perfect clarity, charged with the horror of these unspeakable acts. An older sister nearby, a mother who retreats to her own bedroom; and this poor child must learn to deal with her father's anger and bizarre behavior until she is eighteen. It is quite understandable that most of these tragic memoirs are published following the death of the evil perpetrator. Silverman's father was, after all, chief counsel to the Secretary of the Interior, and then an international banker. Their luxurious suburban lifestyle hid the trauma that enveloped the household. Early on she notes, ""everyone outside the house believes my father is perfect."" Towards the end of the text, while under psychiatric care, she tells her mother, ""I was sexually abused as a child."" Her mother's unforgivable reply, ""I had a terrible childhood, too,"" still reverberates in my mind. This poignant account of childhood sexual abuse is a tough read but its message is clear. Incest is not about sex, it is about violent power and absolute control. I applaud Silverman for her remarkable psychological journey back to a chance at a healthy future.

In that moment of anachronistic quiet, a brilliant astronomer named Zeb Aberly, scouring the heavens with equipment of his own design, makes the discovery of a lifetime: the pulse originated in space--and it carried a message from an intelligent source. But Zeb is not alone. Shadowy forces within the government seek to decipher the message and to keep its existence secret at all costs. Fleeing for his life into the back streets and alleys of Washington, D.C., Zeb embarks on an odyssey that could cost him his family, his sanity, and everything he loves.
<p><i>And it begins with murder.</i> In New Orleans, mob boss Marie Laveau--a descendant of the famous voodoo priestess--is brutally gunned down by nameless, faceless enemies. But Marie's vast wealth has purchased the best life insurance of all: resurrection. Reborn by means of nanotechnology, Marie discovers that her husband and young daughter were also hit, their bodies too badly damaged to be repaired. Now she will stop at nothing to track down and punish those responsible. But her quest will lead beyond vengeance, into the very technology that saved her...and a conspiracy linked to the mysterious event now known as the Silence.</p>
<p>Recurring at unpredictable intervals, the Silence renders electronic-based technology unreliable and dangerous. A substitution must be found before civilization collapses; breakthroughs in nanotech and advances in genetic engineering give hope of a new kind of communication in the future. But now, as babies born aroundthe world in the months following the first Silence grow to adulthood, demonstrating uncanny physical and mental characteristics that bring suspicion and violence, nanotech plagues unleashed by ecoterrorists and fearful governments wreak havoc on an already panicked populace.</p>

Are there unique health issues for lesbians? Are lesbians at higher or lower risk for such health problems as AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, mental disorders, and substance abuse? How does homophobia affect lesbian health and the funding of research on lesbian health? How do lesbian health needs fit into the health care system and the larger society? What risk and protective factors shape the physical and mental health of lesbians?</p> <h3>Marilyn R. Gugliucci</h3> <p>This book is a compilation of the research conducted on lesbian health. The editor outlines the challenges of such research for lesbians, researchers, and society. After a presentation of a comprehensive review of the issues, a list of recommendations and interpretations are suggested for mapping out future directions for lesbian health research. The stated purpose is to assess the science base strengths of lesbian health research, review the methodological challenges involved in conducting said research, and to suggest areas for future attention and research. Although women's health is gaining momentum as an area worthy of research, the lesbian subgroup continues to receive minimal attention. Raising the issues pertaining to lesbian health and research in this field is long overdue. The editor's objectives are clearly outlined and achieved. In addition, the contributors demonstrate recognition and knowledge of the psycho-social and societal issues inherent in lesbian cultures which add to the challenges of conducting lesbian health research. The purpose is to help ""...health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and others interested in lesbian health, to face the challenges and opportunities of the new millennium."" A much stronger appeal needs to be made to lesbians. The text is clear, well organized, and accessible. I view it as empowering to lesbians, in that lesbians can assist in moving the health agenda forward through their participation in research and by supporting policy in this area. The contributors appear to be credible. Credentials are listed in their respective fields, however, there is no statement of philosophy regarding their attitudes of lesbianism.Contributors begin with an executive summary of lesbian health research reviews completed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities. The summary is comprehensive and lays the foundation for the in-depth information found in the body of the text that includes the health status of and risks for lesbians. Included is a holistic definition of health which makes it clear that health is more than the absence of disease or infirmity. Lesbian health is viewed in the larger context of society and the healthcare system. Contributors include the societal challenges for lesbians and the effect these may have on their health. The strengths of this book are: the combination of education and sensitivity with which lesbian health issues are discussed; the consistency of the contributors' appeal to the reader to realize the impact these issues have on the research; the inclusion of cultural, racial, ethnic, and societal factors on this research; and the complexities of lesbian health at the personal, professional, and societal levels. Features worth noting are the use of tables, figures, and boxes that enhance the content, and an extensive and current bibliography that is organized by topics. A shortcoming is the repetitive information found in the executive summary that is restated in the body of the text. Lesbianism and its health issues will remain a part of all cultures and populations throughout the world. The proactive stance of this research review and the contributors' recommendations are critical to educating people about lesbians' health issues and relevant policies. It is about time that awareness is raised in this under-funded, under-researched, and largely closeted area of women's health. I commend the editor and contributors for their academic as well as humanistic exposition of this review.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.14 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches",44.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/72/9780309065672.jpg,Success,13,22.5

Reconsidering the traditional definitions of German modernism and its central issues of race politics, eugenics, and the city, Meskimmon explores the structures that marginalized the work of little known artists such as Lotte Laserstein, Jeanne Mammen, Gerta Overbeck and Grete Jurgens. She shows how these women's personal and professional experiences in the 1920s and 1930s relate to the visual imagery produced at that time. She also examines representations of different female roles&#151;prostitute, mother, housewife, the ""New Woman"" and ""gar&ccedil;onne""&#151;that attracted the attention of these artists. Situating her exploration on a strong theoretical base, she ranges deftly over mass visual culture&#151;from film to poster art and advertising&#151;to create a vivid portrait of women living and creating in Weimar Germany.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",31.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/45/9780520221345.jpg,Success,18,22.5

Yet theyshare a deeply theatrical obsession that shatters any notion of aunified self. All three try out identities from different socialclasses and geographic environments, extend their temporal range intothe past and future, and transform themselves into heroes andvillains,mythological creatures, and sex goddesses. The premise ofInverted Odysseys is that this expanded concept of theself ;this playful urge to ""try on"" other roles-is more than afeminist or psychological issue. It is central to our global culture,to our definition of human identity in a world where the individualexists in a multicultural and multitemporal environment. This book isan""odyssey"" through historical, theoretical, critical, and literaryperspectives on the three artists viewed in the context of theseissues. Contributors include Lynn Gumpert, Lucy Lippard, Jonas Mekas,Ted Mooney, Shelley Rice, and Abigail Solomon-Godeau.Central to the book is Claude Cahun's""Heroines"" manuscript, a seriesof fifteen stream-of-consciousness monologues written in the voices ofmajor women of literature and history, such as the Virgin Mary,Sappho, Cinderella, Penelope,Delilah, and Helen of Troy.

A work of fiction that manages to be both sexually frank and laugh-out-loud funny, <i>The Boys Across the Stree</i>t is the story of an ex-porn star named Rick, who lives across the street from a Chasidic boys' school, and his budding relationship with the students and their families. Rick pursues his interest in the boys by adopting Chasidic dress and dares to confront the codes in Leviticus proscribing homosexual behavior; to Rick, these codes are responsible for the bigotry that batters his life.<br>
<br>
As his relationship with the boys deepens from obsession to friendship, Rick finds himself confronting areas of prejudice within himself. Despite being an avowed atheist, he finds himself drawn to the religious fervor of the Chasidic men as are they to his passionate embrace of their most contemptible of sins. The collision of their different worlds-combined with their increasing closeness-results in interactions that are intense, funny, and full of longing, often all at the same time.<br>

As smart as it is comic, <i>The Boys Across the Street</i> is a powerful blend of eroticism and religion-a novel filled with unforgettable characters, and one that is certain to stir up discussion about sex and repression.<br>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Width: 1 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/00/9780571199600.jpg,Success,9,22.5
