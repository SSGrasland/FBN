It is also the story of Anna's parents: her mother, a woman as remote as she is seductive, and her father, a misogynist army officer who, when Anna cries, tells her, ""We are not born to be comforted."" <p>As Anna picks her way through this emotional minefield, she encounters people and animals that possess the revelatory powers of figures in a dream: the snakes her father's adjutant kills as emmissaries of the Devil; a poetry loving general; a haunted girl whose mother dies of tuberculosis; a frozen crow that miraculously comes back to life. <i>God's Snake</i> is a work filled with passion, magic, and terror, conceived by a novelist of visionary authority.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Anna is a Greek Army brat following her father from posting to posting throughout Greece just after the Civil War. These years of painful deprivation, spent observing her parents' cruel and loveless marriage, teach her the importance of love in adult life. Exploring emotion, especially through her extended family of aunts, uncles, and grandparents, she attempts to discover an adult role for her changing body and sense of self. Spanidou brilliantly portrays Anna's haunting experience in this remarkable first novel. Eschewing chronology for zoology, she reveals Anna through the various animals she encounters, allowing the child's innocence to touch on allegories that pass into knowledge. A prose style as spare and beautiful as the Greek countryside it describes makes this work pleasing as well as thought-provoking. -- Paul E.

Celebrating black women's historical strength, Hine and Thompson accentuate resistance and survival in their 12 chapters. They focus on flesh-and-blood women whose stories of persistence, protest, and progress flow together with famous and unfamiliar names sharing an unbreakable thread spun by faithful and industrious self-reliance. Without peer as a single-volume history of being black and female in America, this book is an inviting opening to the fast-growing scholarship on African American women to which Hine has so richly contributed. Highly recommended for collections on blacks, women, or U.S. history. [Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 10/1/97.]Brenda M. Brock, Univ. at Buffalo, NY, & Thomas J.

Washington; Harlem's Golden Age and Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Paul Robeson. Bessie breaks barriers to become a dentist; Sadie quietly integrates the New York City system as a high school teacher. Their extraordinary story makes an important contribution to our nation's heritage&#8212;and an indelible impression on our lives.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this remarkable and charming oral history, two lively and perspicacious sisters, aged 101 and 103, reflect on their rich family life and their careers as pioneering African American professionals. Brief chapters capture Sadie's warm voice (``Now, I was a `mama's child' '') and Bessie's fiestiness (``I'm alive out of sheer determination, honey!''). The unmarried sisters, who live together, tell of growing up on the campus of a black college in Raleigh, N.C., where their father was an Episcopal priest, and of being too independent for the men who courted them. With parental influence far stronger than that of Jim Crow, they joined professions--Sadie teaching domestic science, Bessie practicing dentistry. In 1920s Harlem they mixed with black activists and later were among the first to integrate the New York City suburb of Mount Vernon. While their account of the last 40 years is sketchy, their observations about everything from black identity to their yoga exercises make them worthwhile company. Freelancer Hearth, who wrote an initial story on the sisters in the New York Times in 1991, has deftly shaped and contextualized their reflections.

A powrful act of witness to the brutal realities of segregation.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this warmhearted, well-observed memoir, the national correspondent for the MacNeil-LehrerNewsHour reflects on her childhood and young adulthood, including her historic role as one of two black students who desegregated the University of Georgia in 196 1. Dwelling a bit too much on her family history and descriptions of the southern towns where she grew up, Hunter-Gault identifies many of the forces that shaped her: strong teachers, good friends and a dignified father struggling as a chaplain in a racist Army. After attending a largely white school in Alaska, she spent her high school years in the supportive black environment of L.A.-Lovely Atlanta. She downplays her heroism at the University of Georgia in order to highlight the heady but humbling feelings she derived from other blacks' pride in her. She tells of harassment and support in those dramatic years, as well as of her growth as a journalist, her public speaking tours and even her romance with a white Southerner. She concludes, a bit awkwardly, with the commencement address she delivered at her alma mater in 1988; this work hints, however, that Hunter-Gault could write a rich sequel.

1-56584-339-8,The New Press Guide to Multicultural Resources for Young Readers,,The New Press,690,1997-11-01,Hardcover,"<p>With over one thousand reviews of multicultural children's books and related materials, organized by theme and reading level, The New Press Guide to Multicultural Resources for Young Readers offers a comprehensive, definitive resource guide to multicultural books for children. The reviews are organized using an innovative thematic approach designed to aid teachers and parents in integrating these works into existing reading lists and at home. In addition, the Guide includes essays on key issues in multicultural education, such as recent immigrant experiences, human rights, and building cross-cultural relationships.</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Two different approaches to multicultural literature make life easier for librarians in putting together curriculum support, developing programs, and expanding one's own awareness of diversity. This review was written and published to address two separate titles, Multicultural Literature for Children and Young Adults by Kathleen T. Horning, et al., and The New Press Guide to Multicultural Resources for Young Readers edited by Daphne Muse. The New Press is a not-for-profit, public interest book publisher founded in 1990 [and] established to serve audiences traditionally neglected by mainstream publishing houses. Its guide has more than one thousand critical reviews for students in kindergarten through eighth grade written by more than one hundred writers and educators. Each review contains bibliographic information; the multicultural category or categories the book is about; special editions of the work (translations into other languages, sound recordings); related titles, in some cases; a synopsis; a more detailed review (250 to 500 words); teaching suggestions (in some); and an evaluation. All reviews are not favorable. There is some criticism, particularly of classics, e.g., Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, for its racism in the depiction of the happy, slave-like pygmies. The book is organized by themes to promote broad use of these resources across the curriculum and across the cultures. Multicultural is defined much more broadly here than in the CCBC title. Racial, ethnic (including European), religious, sexual, and disabled groups are included. There is information on multimedia resources; a timeline of major events in children's literature; and interesting essays that are informative, sometimes controversial ( a look at gender and ethnic stereotyping in recent Disney animated films), but always thought provoking (the Herbert Kohl essay on Rosa Parks is an eye opener). Drawbacks to the book include the small number of titles (basically only seventh- and eighth-grade titles-the categories are K-3, 4-6, and 7-8) that would be of interest to young adult librarians, the questionable inclusion/placement of titles (e.g., Bread Givers is pretty sophisticated for seventh/eighth graders, and one of the American Girls titles would be better in the fourth- through sixth-grade category instead of the older group), and the number of mistakes. Several that I saw were Francis Lea Block, Evelyn Cisneros for Sandra Cisneros, Yep Laurence for the reverse, and the resulting misplacement in the alphabetical sequence; and the lack of a street name in the address for the Washington, D.C., public library. The Cooperative Children's Book Center guide looks at multicultural books it recommends that were published in the United States and Canada between 1991 and 1996. A previously published volume looked at books published between 1980 and 1990. Multicultural has a much narrower definition in this book-by and about people of culture-and includes African, Afro-Caribbean, and African American; American Indian; Asian, Asian Pacific, and Asian American; and Latinos. Each entry includes bibliographic information, a short (several sentences) annotation, in many cases a one-sentence evaluation, and age level (covers age one through the teenage years). This is a more straightforward book-titles are arranged into sixteen categories (by genre or theme) with a detailed index and a separate listing of the books by ethnic/cultural categories (including individual countries and specific tribes). There is an additional listing of authors and illustrators of color by racial background. Both books have a section on the other reference tools devoted to multicultural literature and on literary awards. The two books vary in both of these listings, with the CCBC guide more limited and focused on books. However, the percentage of titles of interest to those working with teens appears greater in this latter book. The New Press book has a more attractive layout and more informative entries, is great for browsing, is more broadly defined, contains a greater variety of materials, has no high school level titles, is easier to use to get the titles for the age level wanted, but is harder to use to compile lists pertaining to specific racial/ethnic/cultural groups. The CCBC guide covers more ages, is narrower in focus, provides less information in each entry but still has good details, and has an easy-to-use appendix that categorizes titles by ethnic/cultural group.

Challenging the foundations of mainstream discourse, her analyses of culture, gender, capital, and race have profoundly influenced democratic theory, antiracist feminism, critical studies and political struggles.</p>
<p>Even for readers who primarily know her as a revolutionary of the late 1960s and early 1970s (or as a political icon for militant activism) she has greatly expanded the scope and range of social philosophy and political theory. Expanding critical theory, contemporary progressive theorists - engaged in justice struggles - will find their thought influenced by the liberation praxis of Angela Y. Davis.</p>
<p><i>The Angela Y. Davis Reader</i> presents eighteen essays from her writings and interviews which have appeared in <i>If They Come in the Morning, Women, Race, and Class, Women, Culture, and Politics,</i> and <i>Black Women and the Blues</i> as well as articles published in women's, ethnic/black studies and communist journals, and cultural studies anthologies. In four parts - ""Prisons, Repression, and Resistance"", ""Marxism, Anti-Racism, and Feminism"", ""Aesthetics and Culture"", and recent interviews - Davis examines revolutionary politics and intellectualism.</p>
<p>Davis's discourse chronicles progressive political movements and social philosophy. It is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary political philosophy, critical race theory, social theory, ethnic studies, American studies, African American studies, cultural theory, feminist philosophy, gender studies.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.098407 Inches, Length: 5.999988 Inches, Weight: 1.22577017672 Pounds, Width: 1.149604 Inches",48.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/12/9780631203612.jpg,Success

Celebrating black women's historical strength, Hine and Thompson accentuate resistance and survival in their 12 chapters.

<p>Sojourner Truth first gained prominence at an 1851 Akron, Ohio, women's rights conference, saying, ""Dat man over dar say dat woman needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches. . . . Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles . . . and ar'n't I a woman?""</p>
<p>Sojourner Truth: ex-slave and fiery abolitionist, figure of imposing physique, riveting preacher and spellbinding singer who dazzled listeners with her wit and originality. Straight-talking and unsentimental, Truth became a national symbol for strong black women—indeed, for all strong women. Like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, she is regarded as a radical of immense and enduring influence; yet, unlike them, what is remembered of her consists more of myth than of personality.</p>
<p>Now, in a masterful blend of scholarship and sympathetic understanding, eminent black historian Nell Irvin Painter goes beyond the myths, words, and photographs to uncover the life of a complex woman who was born into slavery and died a legend. Inspired by religion, Truth transformed herself from a domestic servant named Isabella into an itinerant pentecostal preacher; her words of empowerment have inspired black women and poor people the world over to this day. As an abolitionist and a feminist, Truth defied the notion that slaves were male and women were white, expounding a fact that still bears repeating: among blacks there are women; among women, there are blacks.</p>
<p>No one who heard her speak ever forgot Sojourner Truth, the power and pathos of her voice, and the intelligence of her message. No one who reads Painter's groundbreaking biography will forget this landmark figure and the story of her courageous life.</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.6 Inches, Weight: 0.7605948039 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches",17.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/84/9780393317084.jpg,Success

0-679-77604-4,The Trials of Maria Barbella,"Pucci, Idanna","Random House, Inc.",316,2008-08-05,Paperback,"<p>New York City, April 26, 1895, 9:30 AM. Domenico Cataldo sat studying his cards in a saloon on East 13th Street. He was looking forward to boarding a ship leaving for Italy that very afternoon. His lover, also a young Italian immigrant to New York - Maria Barbella - then entered the bar. There was a brief exchange. ""Only a pig can marry you!"" were his last words. Maria Barbella whipped out a straight razor and slashed his neck so swiftly Cataldo had no chance to scream. He staggered out the door, clutching his throat with both hands, knocking Maria over, spraying blood everywhere. Finally, as he reached Avenue A, he lurched off the curb and fell twitching into the gutter, where he died. Thus began the saga of Maria Barbella, who shortly became the first woman sentenced to die in the electric chair, at the time a brand-new invention. Hearing of her plight, Cora Slocomb, Countess di Brazza - an American by birth, and author Idanna Pucci's great-grandmother - returned to this country to help organize an appeal to save Maria that was, ultimately, successful. The Victorian public was galvanized by the spectacle of Maria's trials. But in fact, her story rings with issues that would fascinate a contemporary audience: sex; prejudice; and the right of a woman to reject the role of victim, to avenge herself against a persecutor.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In 1895, Maria Barbella, a 22-year-old Italian immigrant who worked in a New York City sweatshop, was convicted of killing her abusive lover, Domenico Cataldo, because he refused to marry her, and thereby she became the first woman sentenced to die in the newly invented electric chair. Drawing on primary research in Italy and the U.S., Pucci, an Italian filmmaker and writer, has skillfully crafted Barbella's suspenseful story and, in addition, documented late-19th-century prejudice against Italian Americans and women, as well as the inhumane treatment of prisoners. Barbella was saved from death when Cora Slocomb, a U.S. citizen married to an Italian count (Pucci's great-grandmother), became convinced that Barbella had not intended to kill Cataldo, and she hired an attorney who managed to get his client retried and acquitted.

Grazia, private secretary to the world-renowned Isabella d'Este, is the daughter of an eminent Jewish banker, the wife of the pope's Jewish physician, and the lover of a Christian prince. In a ""secret book,"" written as a legacy for her son, she records her struggles to choose between the seductions of the Christian world and a return to the family, traditions, and duties of her Jewish roots. As she re-creates Renaissance Italy in captivating detail, Jacqueline Park gives us a timeless portrait of a brave and brilliant woman trapped in an unforgiving, inflexible society.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>If I were a queen, my son, I would grant you vast lands and great wealth. If I were a goddess, I would bestow upon you an honorable wife and a tribe of healthy children.... But I am a scholar and a scribe, so the best I have to offer you is a document.' It is 1526 as Grazia Dei Rossiheiress to an Italian-Jewish banking family, wife of the pope's Jewish physician and the lover of a Christian knight begins this 'libro segreto in the Florentine manner.' In this subtle and seductive first novel, Grazia records 'the secrets of the heart' for her son 'so that you may know whence you came from.' She begins with her birth into a 'modern and humanistic' family in Mantova, and the destruction of her 'child's paradise' as her wealthy family flees the province during a blood libel pogrom. Later, when Grazia and handsome young Lord Pirro meet and fall in love, the lovers risk their lives to carry on their interfaith tryst. Princess Isabella D'Este offers Grazia royal protection and her only chance to marry Lord Pirroif she converts to Christianity. But 'deceit is bred in princes,' and the promise is betrayed. In time, Grazia marries gentle and world-renowned Dr. Judah Del Medigo, her 'guardian angel,' but the marriage is passionless: when a son is conceived after many years, the father is Lord Pirro. In the end, it is this son's lot to make Grazia's choice between the Christian lord and the Jewish doctor. Park has created a lively, courageous and introspective heroine. Through Grazia, she elucidates the intricate and perilous world of Italian Jews during the Renaissance, telling her spellbinding story with honesty and humor and meticulous historical accuracy.</p>",en,Edition Unstated,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",18,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/02/9780684848402.jpg,Success

<p>A hundred years ago, women were lacing themselves into corsets and teaching their daughters to do the same. The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?</p>
<p>In <b>The Body Project</b>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance—in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <b>The Body Project</b> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism—a world in which the body is their primary project.</p>

0-195-12289-5,Why History Matters: Life and Thought,"Lerner, Gerda",Oxford University Press,272,1998-02-26,Paperback,"<p><P>""All human beings are practicing historians,"" writes Gerda Lerner. ""We live our lives; we tell our stories. It is as natural as breathing."" It is as important as breathing, too. History shapes our self-definition and our relationship to community; it locates us in time and place and helps to give meaning to our lives. History can be the vital thread that holds a nation together, as demonstrated most strikingly in the case of Jewish history. Conversely, for women, who have lived in a world in which they apparently had no history, its absence can be devastating. In <b>Why History Matters</b>, Lerner brings together her thinking and research of the last sixteen years, combining personal reminiscences with innovative theory that illuminate the importance of history and the vital role women have played in it.<br> <b>Why History Matters</b> contains some of the most significant thinking and writing on history that Lerner has done in her entire career&#151;a summation of her life and work. The chapters are divided into three sections, each widely different from the others, each revelatory of Lerner as a woman and a feminist. We read first of Lerner's coming to consciousness as a Jewish woman. There are moving accounts of her early life as a refugee in America, her return to Austria fifty years after fleeing the Nazis (to discover a nation remarkable both for the absence of Jews and for the anti-Semitism just below the surface), her slow assimilation into American life, and her decision to be a historian. If the first section is personal, the second focuses on more professional concerns. Included here is a fascinating essay on nonviolent resistance, tracing the idea from the Quakers (such as Mary Dyer), to abolitionists such as Theodore Dwight Weld (the ""most mobbed man"" in America), to Thoreau's essay <b>Civil Disobedience</b>, then across the sea to Tolstoy and Gandhi, before finally returning to America during the civil rights movement of the 1950s. There are insightful essays on ""American Values"" and on the tremendous advances women have made in the twentieth century, as well as Lerner's presidential address to the Organization of American Historians, which outlines the contributions of women to the field of history and the growing importance of women as a subject of history. The highlight of the final section of the book is Lerner's bold and innovative look at the issues of class and race as they relate to women, an essay that distills her thinking on these difficult subjects and offers a coherent conceptual framework that will prove of lasting interest to historians and intellectuals.<br> A major figure in women's studies and long-term activist for women's issues, a founding member of NOW and a past president of the Organization of American Historians, Gerda Lerner is a pioneer in the field of Women's History and one of its leading practitioners. <b>Why History Matters</b> is the summation of the work and thinking of this distinguished historian.</p> <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3> <p>Despite its somewhat grandiose title, this isn't in any way a comprehensive approach to the vital question posed, but a collection of speeches and articles that offer only a glimpse of the author's important contributions to historical inquiry.<P>Lerner (The Creation of Feminist Consciousness, 1993; Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison) is a fascinating woman, and some of her extraordinary experiences are revealed here in the portion of the book called ""Life."" An Austrian Jew, Lerner escaped from the Nazis and emigrated to America at age 18. Once here, she determined to be a writer and set about gaining a proficiency in English the likes of which few native-born Americans can boast. But Lerner didn't stop there. At the age of 40, she returned to school to get a graduate degree in history&#151;and not conventional history, but women's history, an area of study that she helped define. In another section, called ""Thought,"" Lerner discusses the field of women's history a little, but these essays, collected from her writings and lectures of the past few years are limited in scope and often repetitive. (For instance, we hear many times that women cannot be treated as a single, unified category because they come from all classes, races, and religions.) This is not to say that Lerner offers nothing of value. For example, her discussions of how to put women into the history curriculum without making them seem inferior to men are perceptive and thoughtful, as is her attempt to redefine race and class in terms of gender.<P> Even here Lerner has much to offer students of history, but from a scholar of her stature, this jumble of essays is a disappointment.<P></p>",en,Revised,"Height: 0.7 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.77382253962 Pounds, Width: 5.5 Inches",28.4,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/93/9780195122893.jpg,Success

Rougeyron's Memoir, First Published Privately In 1947, Recounts His Experiences Rescuing Downed Allied Airmen In France During The War Years. An Auto Engineer And Experimental Race Car Driver Before The War, He Joined The Resistance After The Nazi Occupation And Organized A Network Of Resisters Who Rescued, Sheltered, And Assisted British And American Flyers. Rougeyron's Memoir Is Translated By The Wife Of The First Allied Airman Whose Escape He Facilitated. In Marked Contrast To Rougeyron's Personal Story Is Weitz's Scholarly Account, The First To Research Women's Roles In The Resistance In A Thorough And Comprehensive Way. In Addition To Utilizing The Limited Archival Information Available, Weitz (humanities And Modern Languages, Suffolk Univ.) Has Relied On Interviews With More Than 70 Survivors Of The Resistance, Primarily Women. Weitz Places Their Dangerous And In Many Ways Nontraditional Activities Against The Backdrop Of The Vichy Regime's Antifeminism And Stresses The Opportunities Afforded By The Resistance For Women Both To Change Roles And To Assume New Roles In French Society.

It Includes Not Only The Account, As First Written By Harriet A. Jacobs In 1861, But A Newly Discovered Autobiographical Sketch, Entitled A True Tale Of Slavery, By Her Brother, John S. Jacobs. He, Like His Sister Harriet, Escaped From Slavery; John Was Active As An Abolitionist. Harriet A. Jacobs Was Born Into Slavery In North Carolina In 1813. She Was A House Servant, And Constantly Fearful Of Sexual Predation From Her Master. She Bore Two Children By Another Man Whom Her Master Despised. Her Plight Was Made Worse By Her Master's Wife, Whose Jealousy Seemed To Know No Bounds. Finally She Ran Off, And Hid For Seven Years In A Narrow Part Of An Attic. When The Opportunity Arose, She Was Able To Flee North On A Steamboat, With The Cooperation Of Its Sympathetic Captain. This Narrative Is Considered One Of The Great Works Of African American Women's Literature. It Is A Book That One Cannot Put Down, A Book That Is Immensely Informative And Inspiring, A Book, Which, Like Other Classic Slave Narratives (e.g., John Brown's Slave Life In Georgia), Demonstrates The Resistance Of Slaves To Every Aspect Of Their Enslavement.

Yet, despite all the obstacles, some are achieving at the highest academic and professional levels.<br> <b>Beating the Odds</b> tells their remarkable stories and shows us what African American families have done to raise academically successful sons, sons who are among the top two percent of African American males in terms of SAT scores and grades. The result of extensive and innovative research, <b>Beating the Odds</b> goes beyond mere analysis&#151;and beyond the relentlessly negative media images&#151;to show us precisely how young Black men can succeed despite the roadblocks of racism, the temptations of crime and drugs, and a popular culture that values being ""cool"" over being educated. By interviewing parents and children from a range of economic and educational backgrounds and from both single and two-parent homes, the authors identify those constants that contribute to academic achievement and offer step-by-step guidance on six essential strategies for effective parenting&#58; child-focused love; strong limit-setting and discipline; continually high expectations; open, consistent, and strong communication; positive racial identity and positive male identity; and full use of community resources. The proof of the effectiveness of such strategies is in the sons themselves, who speak eloquently in these pages about their struggles and successes in both the classroom and the often hostile world that surrounds it.<br> Essential reading for parents, teachers, and school administrators, <b>Beating the Odds</b> offers insight, guidance, and hope for anyone concerned about the plight of young African American men and the society they live in.</p>",en,1,"Height: 6.36 Inches, Length: 9.58 Inches, Weight: 1.20372395052 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches",35,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/92/9780195102192.jpg,Success

0-415-91847-2,Black Wealth/ White Wealth: A New Perspective on Racial Inequality,"Shapiro, Thomas M., Oliver, Melvin L.",Routledge,242,1997-01-02,Paperback,"<p><b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> offers a powerful portrait of racial inequality based on an analysis of private wealth. Taking issue with those who point to an expanding black middle class as evidence of greater racial equality, <b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> demonstrates how an analysis of wealth--total assets and debts rather than income alone--uncovers a qualitatively different story about race in America. Providing a comprehensive examination of how material assets are created, expanded and preserved, authors Oliver and Shapiro reveal the persistent and deep economic divide between blacks and whites.<p><b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> charts the ways inequality has been structured over many generations through the same systematic barriers that have affected blacks throughout their history in America--the legacy of slavery, history of low wages, poor education, restriction of blacks as economic free agents. Oliver and Shapiro examine how and why low black entrepreneurship, limited access to capital, red-lining practices, local and state policy, the rise of the modern suburb and the making of the urban ghetto have discouraged and impaired the ability of many blacks to accumulate wealth and opportunities for a better life.<p>Combining quantitative data from over 12,000 households and in-depth interviews with a range of black and white families, the authors measure and conceptualize the racial face of wealth in America. The findings uncover vast differences between blacks and whites&#58; 63% of black households have no financial assets, more than twice the rate of whites; nearly three-quarters of black children grow up in households without any financial resources; the white middle class could support its present standard of living for more than four months without a steady stream of income while the typical black middle class household does not have enough wealth to survive a month. The recent movement of blacks into middle class occupations and gains in educational attainment have not led to commensurate increases in wealth. The racial legacy of the past is etched in present day deprivation of wealth. The authors argue that black achievement at any given level not only requires a greater effort and provides fewer opportunities along the way, but also bestows substantially diminished rewards.<p>The final section of <b></b><b><i>Black Wealth/White Wealth</i></b> identifies and explores the factors, processes and structures behind the vast inequality between the two races and analyzes why wealth portfolios for blacks and whites of equal stature and accomplishment vary so differently. Pointing up the failure of current public policies to redress the problem--because they are based on a restrictive concept of income--the authors' analysis provides insight into some of the real reasons behind racial inequality and articulates ways to link opportunity structures to policies that promote asset formation and narrow the racial wealth gap.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Racial comparisons by income are misleading, argue these two sociologists, because the black middle class lags far behind its white counterpart in terms of assets that can expand choices and opportunities for generations to come. Their analysis provides telling insight into the causes and persistence of American racial inequality: government policies of suburbanization and redlining helped boost wealth for whites over blacks, while discrimination against blacks long kept them from developing assets through self-employment. The authors' study uncovers ``the buried fault line of the American social system,'' and they note that three times as many whites as blacks grow up in households with three months of financial reserves. Because of such intergenerational transfers of wealth, the authors make a philosophical case for racial reparations but also argue for more feasible policies, such as government-supplemented accounts to make education and home-ownership more available, as well as the modification of tax policies (mortgage deductions, capital gains) that subsidize the rich.

0-8139-1833-2,Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,"Gordon-Reed, Annette",University of Virginia Press,320,1998,Paperback,"<p><P>Now updated with a new author's note about the recent DNA study confirming the Jefferson-Hemings liaison<P>Rumors of Thomas Jefferson's sexual involvement with his slave Sally Hemings have circulated for two centuries. It remains, among all aspects of Jefferson's renowned life, perhaps the most hotly contested topic. With Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, Annette Gordon-Reed promises to intensify this ongoing debate as she identifies glaring inconsistencies in many noted scholars' evaluations of the existing evidence. She has assembled a fascinating and convincing argument&#58; not that the alleged thirty-eight-year liaison necessarily took place but rather that the evidence for its taking place has been denied a fair hearing.<P>Friends of Jefferson sought to debunk the Hemings story as early as 1800, and most subsequent historians and biographers have followed suit, finding the affair unthinkable based upon their view of Jefferson's life, character, and beliefs. Gordon-Reed responds to these critics by pointing out numerous errors and prejudices in their writings, ranging from inaccurate citations, to impossible time lines, to virtual exclusions of evidence&#151;especially evidence concerning the Hemings family. She demonstrates how these scholars may have been misguided by their own biases and may even have tailored evidence to serve and preserve their opinions of Jefferson.<P>Possessing both a layperson's unfettered curiosity and a lawyer's logical mind, Annette Gordon-Reed writes with a style and compassion that are irresistible. Each chapter revolves around a key figure in the Hemings drama, and the resulting portraits are engrossing and very personal. Gordon-Reed also brings a keen intuitive sense of the psychological complexities of human relationships&#151;relationships that, in the real world, often develop regardless of status or race. The most compelling element of all, however, is her extensive and careful research, which often allows the evidence to speak for itself. Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings is a controversial new look at a centuries-old question that should fascinate general readers and historians alike. It promises to be the definitive word on the subject for years to come.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Gordon-Reed takes on the historians who would deny that Thomas Jefferson had a 38-year relationship with Sally Hemings, one of his slaves, and she does so both by presenting historical evidence of that relationship and by critiquing their denials. While her account is reasoned and logical, Gordon-Reed is a law professor (at New York Law School) who writes like a lawyer. She justifies this legalistic tone in her preface by pointing out that historians often use legal phrases when debating the controversy, but that doesn't make this dry presentation of the facts any more readable. Primary sources (Madison Hemings's recounting of his mother's relationship with Jefferson, in which he claims Jefferson as his father; the memoirs of Israel Jefferson, a former slave of Jefferson's who corroborated Hemings's story; and a pair of letters discussing the Jefferson-Hemings relationship) are the most lively reading, but they have been banished to an appendix. Gordon-Reed approaches the various players in this drama chapter by chapter and dissects the collective denial of traditional historians with regard to each. She not only handily refutes theories such as the idea that one of Jefferson's nephews, either Samuel Carr or Peter Carr, fathered Hemings's children, but points out the racism inherent in insisting, for example, that Madison Hemings's story of his life cannot be correct because the language is too sophisticated. Her contention that ""Thomas Jefferson's racism was not extraordinary"" is believable and intriguing, but too much that is of interest here becomes obfuscated by legal devices, including a chapter titled ""Summary of the Evidence.""

Avoiding the easy cliche of victimhood and oppression, he searches for answers through three unexpected, overlapping, intensely personal stories. Ultimately he presents a vision of a nation where the futures of blacks and whites are as linked as their histories, and where black experience offers a key to the struggle of every modern American. American Beach opens with the killing of an unarmed black motorist by white police on a Florida resort island. It's the emblematic race confrontation of the 1990s, but Rymer's examination turns up everything but the ordinary. His journey leads us through ghostly plantation cemeteries, seance parlors, black resorts, European opera houses, Harlem salons, America's newest town, and its oldest incorporated black city. Along the way, we are guided by the most extraordinary real-life Southern cast since Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, including Florida's first black millionaire and his great-granddaughter, a flamboyant pauper who lives on a chaise lounge on the beach, from whence she strives to salvage her history and rescue her imperiled culture.

<p>Wounds of Passion is a memoir about writing, love, and sexuality. With her customary boldness and insight, Bell Hooks critically reflects on the impact of birth control and the women's movement on our lives. Resisting the notion that love and writing don't mix, she begins a fifteen-year relationship with a gifted poet and scholar, who inspires and encourages her. Writing the acclaimed book Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism at the age of nineteen, she begins to emerge as a brilliant social critic and public intellectual. Wounds of Passion describes a woman's struggle to devote herself to writing, sharing the difficulties, the triumphs, the pleasures, and the dangers. Eloquent and powerful, this book lets us see the ways one woman writer works to find her own voice while creating a love relationship based on feminist thinking.

<p>Over three centuries, approximately one hundred thousand persons, most of whom were women, were put to death under the guise of ""witch hunts"", particularly in Reformation Europe. The shocking annihilation of women from all walks of life is explored in this brilliant, authoritative feminist history Anne Llwellyn Barstow. Barstow exposes an unrecognized holocaust — the ""ethnic cleansing"" of independent women in Reformation Europe — and examines the residual attitudes that continue to influence our culture.</p>
<p>Barstow argues that it is only with eyes sensitive to gender issues that we can discern what really happened in the persecution and murder of these women. Her sweeping chronicle examines the scapegoating of women from the ills of society, investigates how their subjugation to sexual violence and death sent a message of control to all women, and compares this persecution of women with the enslavement and slaughter of African slaves and Native Americans.</p>
<p>Ultimately Barstow traces the current backlash against women to its gynophobic torture-filled origins. In the process, she leaves an indelible mark on our growing understanding of the legacy of violence against women around the world.</p>",en,Reprint,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.5180863157 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches",11.26,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/65/9780062510365.jpg,Success

0-385-47361-3,Divided Sisters,"Midge Wilson, Russell, Kathy",Doubleday,340,1995-12-01,Hardcover,"Since the advent of the women's movement, women have often expressed the belief that black and white women in society have a great many common concerns, and are in fact natural allies. The reality is more sobering. In <i>Divided Sisters</i>, Midge Wilson and Kathy Russell, the acclaimed authors of <i>The Color Complex</i>, tackle the nature of relationships between black and white women, and explore how they do, and don't, get along.<br>
<br>
Based on scores of interviews, cultural literature and extensive research, <i>Divided Sisters</i> examines relations between black and white women as children, as adults, at school and in college, at work and at home. Truthfully as adults relatively few women feel they are close friends with a woman from another racial background. The book exposes many of the challenges and obstacles that complicate interracial relationships in a society with a long history of racial inequality. What Midge and Kathy discover is that the concerns and frustrations of black and white women are often different, and that these differences are frequently not communicated. For example, women thrown together for the first time in college are often ill-prepared to handle cultural differences in dress, customs, attitudes and background. In addition, peer pressure, economic and historical inequality, real or perceived racism, and fear, play a role in dividing rather than uniting women.<br>

0-691-02896-6,At the Heart of Freedom,Drucill Cornell,Princeton University Press,240,1998-09-14,Paperback,"<p>How can women create a meaningful and joyous life for themselves? Is it enough to be equal with men? In this provocative and wide-ranging book, Drucilla Cornell argues that women should transcend the quest for equality and focus on what she shows is a far more radical project: achieving freedom. Cornell takes us on a highly original exploration of what it would mean for women politically, legally, and culturally, if we took this ideal of freedom seriously—if, in her words, we recognized that ""hearts starve as well as bodies."" She takes forceful and sometimes surprising stands on such subjects as abortion, prostitution, pornography, same-sex marriage, international human rights, and the rights and obligations of fathers. She also engages with what it means to be free on a theoretical level, drawing on the ideas of such thinkers as Kant, Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Hegel, and Lacan.</p>
<p>Cornell begins by discussing what she believes lies at the heart of freedom: the ability for all individuals to pursue happiness in their own way, especially in matters of love and sex. This is only possible, she argues, if we protect the ""imaginary domain""—a psychic and moral space in which individuals can explore their own sources of happiness. She writes that equality with men does not offer such protection, in part because men themselves are not fully free. Instead, women must focus on ensuring that individuals face minimal interference from the state and from oppressive cultural norms. They must also respect some controversial individual choices. Cornell argues in favor of permitting same-sex couples to marry and adopt children, for example. She presses for access to abortion and for universal day care. She also justifies lifestyles that have not always been supported by other feminists, ranging from staying at home as a primary caregiver to engaging in prostitution. She argues that men should have similar freedoms—thus returning feminism to its promise that freedom for women would mean freedom for all.</p>
<p>Challenging, passionate, and powerfully argued, Cornell's book will have a major impact on the course of feminist thought.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.87523518014 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",38.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/65/9780691028965.jpg,Success

Camp Notes and Other Writings recounts this experience. Yamada's poetry yields a terse blend of emotions and imagery. Her twist of words creates a twist of vision that make her poetry come alive. The weight of her cultural experience - the pain of being perceived as an outsider all of her life - permeates her work. Yamada's strength as a poet stems from the fact that she has managed to integrate both individual and collective aspects of her background, giving her poems a double impact. Her strong portrayal of individual and collective life experience stands out as a distinct thread in the fabric of contemporary literature by women.</p> <h3>Los Angeles Times</h3> <p>Her reflections of the camp are vivid, pain-filled, weighted with irony. . . .She confronts the 'invisibility' of Asian American women in American culture.</p>",en,None ed.,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/65/9780813526065.jpg,Success

0-674-79655-1,The Second Stage: With a New Introduction,"Friedan, Betty",Harvard University Press,396,1998-04-01,Paperback,"<p>First published in 1981, <i>The Second Stage</i> is eerily prescient and timely, a reminder that much of what is called new thinking in feminism has been eloquently observed and argued before. Warning the women's movement against dissolving into factionalism, male-bashing, and preoccupation with sexual and identity politics rather than bottom-line political and economic inequalities, Friedan argues that once past the initial phases of describing and working against political and economic injustices, the women's movement should focus on working with men to remake private and public arrangements that work against full lives with children for women and men both. Friedan's agenda to preserve families is far more radical than it appears, for she argues that a truly equitable preservation of marriage and family may require a reorganization of many aspects of conventional middle-class life, from the greater use of flex time and job-sharing, to company-sponsored daycare, to new home designs to permit communal housekeeping and cooking arrangements.</p>
<p>Called ""utopian"" fifteen years ago, when it seemed unbelievable that women had enough power in the workplace to make effective demands, or that men would join them, some of these visions are slowly but steadily coming to pass even now. The problem Friedan identifies is as real now as it was years ago: ""how to live the equality we fought for,"" and continue to fight for, with ""the family as new feminist frontier."" She writes not only for women's liberation but for human liberation.</p>


                        <p>This classic work provides a vision and blueprint for the women's movement. An afterward by Friedan offers a ten point program for launching the second stage of the movement.
