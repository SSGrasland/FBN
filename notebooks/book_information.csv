Set in Cleveland, the novel opens in 1967 as Evan Eichenbaum suffers a heart attack; it then moves back to the thirties and early forties before coming to a heartwrenching end in the present. Three generations of the Eichenbaum family, each in its turn, face the same crucial question: How is it possible to keep those we love safe when the world at large is beyond our control? In the 1930s, Evan and his wife, Vera - once immigrants to America - try to save their Jewish relatives left in Europe, only to be challenged by hostile U.S. immigration laws; during World War II, they try to shield their sons Teddy and Hankus from the draft; in the present, their daughter, Joy, and her children face the peril of AIDS. Marcie Hershman makes these characters come alive in ways that will astonish you, and she depicts so vividly the events that threaten them that it seems as if you are seeing history from an entirely new vantage point. Although the horrors of the past sixty years form the background of the narrative, Safe in America is in fact a love story: of parents for children, of brothers for sisters, of all the pain, grief, and grace that are part of the complex ways we are bound to one another by blood. In exquisite prose and with an understanding of history as subtle as it is profound, Marcie Hershman looks into the heart of a family to reveal the real triumphs that exist within devastation, and tells a story you will never forget.",en,Reprint,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.49 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/49/9780060927349.jpg,Success

This does not explain, however, the existence of many religious groups in which women are both leaders and the majority of participants. How are these women's religions different from those dominated by men? What can we learn from them about the special ways in which women experience their unique reality? In this fascinating and pathbreaking work&#151;the first comparative study of women's religions&#151;Susan Starr Sered seeks answers to thse compelling questions.<br> Looking for common threads linking groups as diverse as the ancestral cults of the Black Caribs of Belize, Korean shamanism, Christian Science, and the Feminist Spirituality movement, Sered finds that motherhood and motherly concerns play a vital role in these female-dominated groups. Nurturing and concern for others are at the center, as are healing arts and ways of dealing with illness and the death of children. Religion not only enables women to find sacred meaning in their daily lives, from the preparation of food to caring for their families, but an offer intense and personal relationships with deities and spirits&#151;often through ecstatic possession trance&#151;as well as opportunities to celebrate and mourn with other women.<br> By examining the shared experiences of women across great cultural divides, <b>Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister</b> offers a new understanding of the role gender plays in determining how individuals grapple with the ultimate questions of existence. In the process, it not only highlights the profound differences between men and women, but the equally important ways in which we are all alike.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>In this provocative and scholarly study, anthropologist Sered examines a dozen women's religions, which together constitute almost all the well-documented female-dominated religions of the world. Both obvious and previously overlooked in such studies is Sered's exploratory axis of motherhood (in the social and emotional sense rather than the biological one). Despite the dissimilarities that are to be expected in such a diversity of cultures as this, patterns still emerge: an interpersonal rather than an individualistic orientation; an emphasis on food (served in quanity rather than in small, symbolic portions); a this-worldly attitude that seeks to eliminate suffering here and now; a dearth of creation stories and end-days scenarios; no sense of forcible conversion or holy war; and no worship of a single, all-powerful, male deity, etc. Sered's work is complex, rich and pervasive, but never pedantic.

Kono Taeko has won all of Japan's major literary prizes for fiction (among them the Akutagawa, the Tanizaki, the Noma, and the Yomiuri). Her disquieting stories, with their strange beauty and undercurrent of sadomasochism, bring to mind Tanizaki, but in a new vein. Subtly ruthless, they lift the latch on complacent views of womanhood. In the title story, the protagonist loathes young girls, but she compulsively buys expensive clothes for little boys so that she can watch them struggle to dress and undress. The impersonal gaze Kono Taeko turns on this behavior transfixes the reader with a fatal question: What are we hunting for? And why? Exploring freedom and bondage, these stories refract light from the strangely facing mirrors of fantasy and reality; pain and pleasure; the active and the passive. As the tales consider the possibilities, implications, and limitations of romantic masochism, Kono Taeko's narrative voice gives the impression of being ""inside"" and ""outside"" at once. Viewing couples' shifting complex power issues through the eyes of women, the author indirectly addresses their position in the world. And with a brave, eerie stylistic purity, Kono Taeko renders the unpronounceable palpable.",en,,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",21.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/59/9780811213059.jpg,Success

While Mariana escapes Madrid for a coastal resort to seek respite in solitude from a damaged love-affair, Sofia walks out on her husband and finds refuge in her children's chaotic apartment. The two women fill notebooks with their insights and recollections and engage in a correspondence in which they lay bare their souls. They pool these deeply dredged findings about themselves and discover, as they realise on meeting again, that they have written a novel ... Variable Cloud a probing, limpid, cruelly witty dissection of married (and unmarried) life in all its absurdities and self-deceptions.

After An Absorbing If Slow-paced Setup, Gutcheon Errs In Focusing The Denouement Too Closely On Rue, Abandoning The Points Of View Of Crucial Minor Characters (such As The Secretary Who Plays An Important Role In Rue's Marriage) Who Added Dimension To The First Half Of The Story. By Relying Too Heavily On The Perspective Of A Character Who Responds To Heartbreak Primarily With Dignified Composure, This Quiet Novel Fails To Deliver Sufficient Emotional Impact.

Page Lambert is an authentic voice of this land, and in telling her story, she tells the story of the West. In writing about loss of a heritage and the quest to find it anew, she speaks of ranching traditions and Native American beliefs that go back many generations and of the cycles of life and death so elemental to ranchers. She tells of learning about her deaf grandmother Effie, a young wife pioneering in the Mojave Desert, and about her grandmother Helen, whose own trail of ancestral tears has meaning for Page.

They have all had their novels seized by the border guards of Canada Customs. And what has Little Sister's, a small gay and lesbian bookstore in western Canada, done about it? They have taken the Government to court, launching one of the century's most impressive challenges to state censorship. Restricted Entry is the story of Little Sister's battle to end Customs' ongoing harassment of gay and lesbian authors and booksellers. In the final months of 1994, the lawsuit was played out in provincial Supreme Court with all the intensity of an old-fashioned obscenity trial. The courtroom drama pitted bookseller versus vice squad, artist vs. psychologist, author vs. bureaucrat. Pierre Berton, Sarah Schulman, Carole Vance and Pat Califia, among many others, testified in the fight for an end to censorship of minority cultures and in defence of all people's right to choose what they will or will not read.

Combining data from both telephone surveys and in-depth focus groups, Ambition and Accommodation paints a fascinating portrait of the strategies used by men and women to cope with the discrepancies between their espoused principles and the realities of everyday life. By juxtaposing the voices of women and men from all walks of life, Sigel finds that women's perceptions of gender relations are complex and often contradictory. Although most women see gender discrimination pervading nearly all social interactions - private as well as public - they do not invariably feel that they personally have been its victims. The vast majority share much of the feminist agenda: they favor pay equity, equal access to jobs, and social anti economic policies designed to improve women's lives. Coupled with these attitudes, however, is a decided lack of concern with gaining access to power or seeking fundamental changes in social institutions, least of all in the family. Most women feel they have more in common with the men to whom they are closest than with women as a group. This perspective, according to Sigel, helps explain not only their desire to avoid open conflict with men, but also their willingness to accommodate a less-than-egalitarian situation by taking on a second shift at home or by working harder than a man on the job. Ultimately, the women in Sigel's study can be best characterized as neither rebellious nor passive but, instead, essentially pragmatic and considerably ambivalent as they strive for more equitable treatment.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.81350574678 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/67/9780226756967.jpg,Success

In this revealing work, Charlene Haddock Seigfried effectively reunites two major social and philosophical movements, arguing that pragmatism, because of its focus on the emancipatory potential of everyday experiences, offers feminism its most viable and powerful philosophical foundation. <br><br>With careful attention to their interwoven histories and contemporary concerns, <i>Pragmatism and Feminism</i> effectively invigorates both traditions, opening them to new interpretations and appropriations and asserting their timely philosophical relevance. This foundational work in feminist theory simultaneously invites and guides future scholarship in an area of rapidly emerging significance.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>An introduction to the broad swath of overlapping pragmatist and feminist issues in theory and practice, illustrating the depth of analysis possible by a few detailed reconstructions.

0-674-63934-0,Only Words,"MacKinnon, Catharine A.",Harvard University Press,160,1996-03-01,,Paperback,"<p>When is rape not a crime? When it's pornography—or so First Amendment law seems to say: in film, a rape becomes ""free speech."" Pornography, Catharine MacKinnon contends, is neither speech nor free. Pornography, racial and sexual harassment, and hate speech are acts of intimidation, subordination, terrorism, and discrimination, and should be legally treated as such. <i>Only Words</i> is a powerful indictment of a legal system at odds with itself, its First Amendment promoting the very inequalities its Fourteenth Amendment is supposed to end. In the bold and compelling style that has made her one of our most provocative legal critics, MacKinnon depicts a society caught in a vicious hypocrisy. Words that offer bribes or fix prices or segregate facilities are treated by law as acts, but words and pictures that victimize and target on the basis of race and sex are not. Pornography—an act of sexual domination reproduced in the viewing—is protected by law in the name of ""the free and open exchange of ideas."" But the proper concern of law, MacKinnon says, is not what speech says, but what it does. What the ""speech"" of pornography and of racial and sexual harassment and hate propaganda does is promote and enact the power of one social group over another. Cutting with surgical deftness through cases of harassment in the workplace and on college campuses, through First Amendment cases involving Nazis, Klansmen, and pornographers, MacKinnon shows that as long as discriminatory practices are protected as free speech, equality will be only a word.</p>

She lucidly describes what we know about the causes of breast cancer: hormonal factors, environmental hazards, smoking, and heredity, including the newly discovered breast cancer gene. She discusses the tainted data in some large National Cancer Institute studies. And she tells us about research on diet, exercise, and other precautionary measures that might help prevent the disease. Zeroing in on the many controversies that swirl around diagnosis and treatment, Altman questions why so many women are still getting mastectomies when studies show that survival rates are the same with lumpectomies. She discusses the ongoing mammography debate and examines both sides of the debate over the hormonal drug tamoxifen. And she looks at the recent dispute over silicone breast implants. Finally, Altman turns to the social, economic, and political ramifications of breast cancer. She shows how breast cancer patients often face problems with health insurance, job discrimination, and sexual relationships. She criticizes the medical establishment for its long-standing neglect of breast cancer and other women's health issues. And she shows how a national network of breast cancer activists has dramatically increased public awareness of the disease while putting pressure on the doctors and politicians to increase research and improve treatment.

Flora Nwapa, Adaora Lily Ulasi, Buchi Emecheta, Funmilayo Fakunle, Ifeoma Okoye, Zaynab Alkali, Eno Obong, and Simi Bedford are the writers Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi considers. African womanism, an emerging model of female discourse, is at the heart of their writing. In their work, female resistance shifts from the idea of <i>palava</i>, or trouble, to a focus on consensus, compromise, and cooperation; it tackles sexism, totalitarianism, and ethnic prejudice. Such inclusiveness, Ogunyemi shows, stems from an emphasis on motherhood, acknowledging that everyone is a mother's child, capable of creating <i>palava</i> and generating a compromise.
<p>Ogunyemi uses the novels to trace a Nigerian women's literary tradition that reflects an ideology centered on children and community. Of prime importance is the paradoxical Mammywata figure, the independent, childless mother, who serves as a basis for the new woman in these novels. Ogunyemi tracks this figure through many permutations, from matriarch to exile to woman writer, her multiple personalities reflecting competing loyalties—to self and other, children and nation. Such fragmented personalities characterize the postcolonial condition in their writing. Mapping geographies of pain and endurance, the work opens a space for addressing the <i>palava</i> between different groups of people. Valuable as the first sustained critical study of a substantial but little known body of literature, this book also counters the shortcomings of prevailing ""masculinist"" theories of black literature in a powerful narrative of the Nigerian world.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 1.42 Inches",13.1,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/55/9780226620855.jpg,Success

The sixth of seven children in a poor black family headed by an alcoholic mother, Bertice couldn't have known what the future would hold for her. She withstood taunts about her looks and weight, suffered the anxieties brought on by her mother's debilitating disease, and, of course, endured encounters with racism. Although she'd been told she wasn't college material, Bertice fought the obstacles and earned a Ph.D. She became an instructor of sociology at Kent State before discovering her talent as a stand-up comic. Today, Dr. Bertice Berry speaks to thousands every year as a popular lecturer, is a singer of growing reputation, and is a successful standup comedienne whose act can be seen in comedy clubs, on television, and on the stage. In this inspirational memoir and handbook for life's bumpy road, Bertice offers her unique take on relationships, education, motherhood, racism, spirituality, beauty, fitness, and many other important topics, and she offers them with humor and insight. The result is a prescription for personal empowerment - find your purpose and live it.

                        <p>Award-wining comedian, motivational speaker, writer, singer, TV talk show host, and sitcom star Bertice Berry combines inspiration, folk wisdom, humor, and pathos to share truths of her life and our society.

Murray examines the emergence of gay and lesbian social life, the creation of lesbigay communities, and the forces of resistance that have mobilized and fostered a group identity. Murray also considers the extent to which there is a single ""modern"" homosexuality and the enormous range of homosexual behaviors, typifications, self-identifications, and meanings. Challenging prevailing assumptions about gay history and society, Murray questions conventional wisdom about the importance of World War II and the Stonewall riots for conceiving and challenging the notion of a shared oppression. He reviews gay complicity in the repathologizing of homosexuality during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. Discussing recent demands for inclusion in the ""straight"" institutions of marriage and the U.S. military, he concludes that these are new forms of resistance, not attempts to assimilate. Finally, Murray examines racial and ethnic differences in self-representation and identification. Drawing on two decades of studying gay life in North America, this tour de force of empirical documentation and social theory critically reviews what is known about the emergence, growth, and internal diversity of communities of openly gay men and lesbians. American Gay deepens our understanding of the ways individuals construct sexualities through working and living together.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1243575362 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches",4.32,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/37/9780226551937.jpg,Success

I ate cereal, sweet milk, ripe, flawless peach. It might have been otherwise.<p>I took the dog uphill to the birch wood.<p>All morning I did the work I love.<P>At noon I lay down with my mate. It might have been otherwise.<p>We ate dinner together at a table with silver candlesticks. It might have been otherwise.<p>I slept in a bed in a room with paintings on the walls, and planned another day just like this day.<p>But one day, I know,<p>it will be otherwise.</p><h3>Susan Shapiro</h3><p><P>Jane Kenyon was always a quiet poet. Her 1986 collection is called <i>The Boat of Quiet Hours</i>, her poem ""Afternoon in the House"" begins ""It's quiet here. The cats/sprawl, each/in a favored place,"" and several other poems speak eloquently of silence. Yet if you listen carefully and read between the lines, there's always noise lurking somewhere: bugs, accidents, traumas, storms and an underlying turbulence that makes Kenyon's work darker and more interesting than most New England nature poets. Kenyon's new poetry book, <i>Otherwise</i>, published on the first anniversary of her death from leukemia, includes new poems, sections from her four previous collections and a poignant afterward by her husband, the poet Donald Hall. <P>Although Kenyon's frequent references to cats, dogs and birds may become tiresome for non animal-lovers, and too many of these poems employ religious imagery that seems pedestrian, the characters in her day-to-day life are engaging, as are the dialogue and details she employs to elucidate her relationship to them. In ""Ironing Grandmother's Tablecloth"" she tells of visiting her eccentric grandmother, who complains ""how my father left poisoned grapefruit on the back/porch at Christmas, how somebody comes at night/to throw stones at the house."" In ""My Mother,"" her mother returns from a trip downtown to the dime store: ""She is wearing her red shoes with straps across the instep. They fasten with small white buttons, like the eyes of a fish."" <P>Perhaps the most interesting and complex character is Kenyon's own depression, often personified and omnipresent. ""Having It Out With Melancholy"" reads like an argument: ""Suggestion From a Friend: You wouldn't be so depressed/if you really believed in God."" Yet this is a poet who can also write that ""Happiness is the uncle you never/knew about, who flies a single-engine plane/onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes/into town, and inquires at every door/until he finds you asleep midafternoon."" Indeed, <i>Otherwise</i> is not without its transcendent moments of joy. -- <i>Salon</i></p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 10.1999796 inches, Length: 5.76 inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.9499981 inches",23.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/00/9781555972400.jpg,Success

In November 1993 Julie Friedeberger developed breast cancer and had a mastectomy. This powerful, inspiring book is the story of the inner journey that transformed her life, a journey that led her from terror, anger and denial, to acknowledgement and acceptance. A Visible Wound is much more than a personal story. It offers practical and spiritual help to others dealing with grave illness.

Historian Constance H. Buchanan traces the long religious history of the idea that women's authority extends only to the home, and explores how this formulation continues, in often unrecognized ways, to shape modern ""secular"" values. She shows how black and white women reformers in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century America were able to challenge moral barriers to their leadership, changing communities and the national agenda with their public achievements. Contemporary women, Buchanan suggests, can learn from this tradition as they face similar barriers to their leadership and articulate their own public vision. Buchanan argues that women must play a larger role in national affairs, but not as scapegoats for deep-seated problems. Women's fresh viewpoints on both the norms of the public world and the realities of the private one can be ignored only at great cost to the nation. Choosing to Lead makes an important contribution to understanding the crisis of American values and what - and who - can help solve it.",en,2nd Printing,"Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",27.5,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/29/9780807020029.jpg,Success

The following year de Beauvoir passed Bianca on to her ""essential partner,"" Jean-Paul Sartre. The three formed a menage a trois until 1940, when Bianca was suddenly abandoned by her dual mentors and lovers. Their lack of concern for Bianca's fate as a Jew in occupied France made the abrupt break even more shattering for her. She began to suffer periodic bouts of severe depression linked not only to the Nazi horrors, but to the betrayal by de Beauvoir and Sartre. After World War II, Bianca Bienenfeld (now married to Bernard Lamblin) resumed a platonic friendship with de Beauvoir that lasted more than forty years, but the pain of the old, perturbing affair flooded back when, in 1990, she read de Beauvoir's posthumously published Letters to Sartre and War Journal. The intimate content of these books referred directly to Bianca in a tone of ridicule and contempt, and she finally discovered the full extent of de Beauvoir's deception. Now Bianca explodes with the true story behind her earlier relationship with the high priests of existentialism. Published here in English for the first time, her memoir reveals what it was like to be a third party in the ""contingent"" affairs of de Beauvoir and Sartre. Bianca's compelling narrative is not written out of revenge or retaliation. Rather, it is an eloquent, candid account of how de Beauvoir and Sartre influenced the shape of her life and how she survived a disgraceful affair that, when broken, almost broke her. Bianca's unique perspective on de Beauvoir and Sartre is the central focus of the book, but not the sole one. She writes about her love for her husband Bernard, who helped her recover. She also describes life during the dark times of German occupation, and recounts witnessing the battle of Vercors during the French Resistance.

Now, twenty years on, Chicago takes us Beyond the Flower, lifting the veil of the international public persona she has become since her influential work The Dinner Party, and revealing her very personal struggles as an artist and a woman in late-twentieth-century America. With the same intense intimacy and unabashed probing of issues of gender, power, and history that characterize her monumental works of art and made Through the Flower a classic in the literature of women and the arts, she asks hard questions about the role of art in our culture. Judy Chicago's contagious and affirmative energy suffuses Beyond the Flower, and this volume will excite and provoke dialogue among feminists, art lovers, and talented women rising through the ranks of any profession - or now taking stock of their lives.

Now, thirteen of today's leading critics and historians challenge and redefine conventional assumptions in a highly original and revealing series of essays that focus on artist and writer couples who have shared both sexual and artistic bonds, combining biography with evaluation of each partner's work in the context of their relationship. Significant Others features such celebrated duos as Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, Anais Nin and Henry Miller, and Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. The contributors explore the nature of artistic companionships, with their corresponding limitations and innovations; the tangled questions of identity; the roles of gender and sexuality; and the stereotypes imposed by society. Many of the essays are particularly concerned with the way women and men have been evaluated in relation to their partners in traditional biographies, art history and literary criticism. We are encouraged to think in new ways about inspirational interaction, and to reassess both women's and men's contributions to culture and the importance of their art. These creative unions offer arresting instances of sexual and artistic collision, collusion and mutual stimulation. Significant Others presents thirteen dramas, with imaginative and courageous players who chose fruitful, colorful and often difficult solutions to the dilemmas of social constraint and competing genius.",en,First Paperback Edition,"Height: 9.2999814 Inches, Length: 6.1999876 Inches, Weight: 1.3007273458 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/41/9780500278741.jpg,Success
