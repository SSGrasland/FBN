0-06-251426-1,Divine Daughters: Liberating the Power and Passion of Women's Voices,"Bagby, Rachel L.",Harper San Francisco,288,1999,Hardcover,"An extraordinary vocal artist, storyteller, and performer, Rachel Bagby has something to say. She calls on mothers, daughters, and sisters everywhere to reclaim their own voices by living ""an out-loud devotion to freedom""--singing, whispering, speaking--and to respect their essential passions along the way. Deeply rooted in her own life story, <i>Divine Daughters</i> is about the power of speech, the power of silence, the power of sound, and the power of storytelling.
<p>In this unique and refreshing narrative, Rachel Bagby offers a powerful testament to the connection between self-expression, personal power, and restorative community. <i>Divine Daughters</i> reveals the relationship between the discovery and recovery of one's peerless voice and the experience of daughters as divine. Drawing on the experiences of her own tumultuous life-including creative fervor, rape, homelessness, and then critical success-Bagby chronicles the reclamation of both her voice and her passion and challenges us to do the same. With poetic lyricism and a great gift for storytelling, Bagby urges us to reap the empowering benefits that come from tapping into life's wellspring of sound and song.</p>
<p>Lyrically told, Bagby's story is at times painfully honest about her own struggles to find her true voice in relationship with ""Life Itself."" She reveals the power of voice with stories about courage and shame, forgiveness, infidelity, equality, and ecology. She asks us to articulate compassion every day and to amplify the daughterly divinity found in spiritual texts, legend, folktale, custom, and creation stories. Finally, she emphasizes the importance of nurturing our daughters's voices and charges womeneverywhere to create restorative communities that ""consistently give voice to Life.""</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches",22,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/64/9780062514264.jpg,Success

But it departs from other such histories because it focuses on how certain late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century women whose lives can be described as 'lesbian' were in the forefront of the battle to procure the rights and privileges that large numbers of Americans enjoy today. A groundbreaking reappraisal of those women known by history but whose histories are incomplete, To Believe in Women examines how their lesbianism may in fact have facilitated their accomplishments. Lillian Faderman, twice winner of the Lambda Award, persuasively argues that even before a lesbian identity was defined, many early female leaders had what would now be called lesbian relationships, free from the constraints of traditional heterosexual arrangements that might otherwise have impeded their pursuits in education, politics, and culture. A book of impeccable research and compelling readability, To Believe in Women will be a source of enlightenment for all, and for many a singular source of pride.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/07/9780395850107.jpg,Success

Living alone and juggling two jobs to pay her mortgage aren't what she would have planned for herself. And that's exactly thc problem. Because she never took charge of her life, her life took charge of her. Rather than finishing her education, she put all her energy into training dogs and showing horses. After she was dumped by the woman for whom she left her marriage, Joan just couldn't get into the dating scene. At times, she thought, the only things that kept her going were her dog, her love of the outdoors, and her long term relationship with her best friend, Diane.

Works by women artists within the Pre-Raphaelite style have, however, largely been forgotten and ignored in the history of the movement. This book, published to accompany an exhibition in Manchester, England, brings together paintings, drawings, photographs, and other works that women contributed to the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Many are reproduced and documented here for the first time. Spanning three generations from the 1840s to the early 1900s, the artists include Barbara Bodichon, Anna Howitt, Rosa Brett, Anna Blunden, Jane Benham Hay, Joanna Boyce, Elizabeth Siddal, Rebecca Solomon, Emma Sandys, Julia Margaret Cameron, Lucy and Catherine Madox Brown, Marie Spartali Stillman, Maria Zambaco, Francesca Alexander, Evelyn De Morgan, Kate Bunce, Marianne Stokes, Christina Herringham, and Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale. Their works demonstrate that Pre-Raphaelitism is a broader historical movement than has previously been recognized and that women were active in all its phases. Their re-inclusion in Pre-Raphaelite history will redefine its scope, concerns, and achievements, as well as restore a wealth of neglected works to public attention.",en,"First Edition, U.S., Softcover","Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",24.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/48/9780500281048.jpg,Success

This edition is expanded to include essays which explore ""neo-noir"", postmodernism and other trends.<p></p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Film noir flourished in the years during and immediately following World War II, but the genre has never disappeared, as shown by the recent popularity of films like Basic Instinct, Bound, and LA Confidential. These academic essays, compiled by Kaplan (English, SUNY), ponder the ""absent family"" in noir, the role of woman as destroyer and redeemer, the common theme of female duplicity, and the role of women in the narrative structure. Other films considered here are Blue Gardenia, Gilda, Double Indemnity, modern noir films like Klute, and the horror classic The Haunting, which one critic sees as a representation of the ""disruptive force of lesbian desire."" Though few studies of women in this popular genre exist, the book's academic format and language will discourage most general readers.

1-57806-132-6,The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe : Ninety-Nine and a Half Won't Do,"Kogan, Lee",University Press of Mississippi,112,1998-12-01,Hardcover,"<p>For Nellie Mae Rowe (1900-1982) the old Southern world of shotgun houses, small churches, flowers, trees, and farm animals shined in her drawings, paintings, and sculpture. A self-taught artist from rural Georgia, she began creating when she was alone after the death of her second husband in 1948. From then until her death, her dreams and memories salved her loneliness with images of a bygone day, and these she made into art.</p>
<p><i>The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe</i> is the most substantial gathering of her work to date. Here eighty full color and ten black and white images display the artist's extraordinary intuitive color sense and the vibrancy and variety of her work.</p>
<p>She used whatever materials were at hand. When painting and drawing on paper, Styrofoam, cardboard, and wood, she favored plain and colored pencils, ink and felt tip pens, and gouache. Jewelry, lace, wigs, felt hats, and eye-glasses enhanced her cloth dolls. Sculpting, she gathered found objects, marbles, and glitter and fastened them with chewing gum. In these color-saturated works, there is an exuberant and idiosyncratic self-expression.</p>
<p>Lee Kogan, director of the Folk Art Institute of the Museum of American Folk Art, unites the paintings and sculptures with a look at the artist's surroundings, practices, and culture. This collection of her work also includes a preface by Gerard C. Wertkin, Director of the Museum of American Folk Art, and a contextual essay by Atlanta-born Kinshasa Holman Conwill, director of the Studio Museum of Harlem.</p>
<p>Nellie Mae Rowe lived her entire life on the rural fringes of Atlanta in Fayetteville and Vinings, Georgia. She was one of nine daughters of a former slave who worked as a farmer, a blacksmith, and basket weaver.</p>",en,F First Printing,"Height: 12.31 inches, Length: 9.35 inches, Weight: 2.04 Pounds, Width: 0.68 inches",30,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/27/9781578061327.jpg,Success

What 'difference' Can Feminist 'interventions In Art's Histories' Make? Should We Simply Reject The All-male Succession Of 'great Artists' In Favour Of An All-woman Litany Of Artistic Heroines?

Differencing The Canon Moves Between Feminist Re-readings Of The Canonical Modern Masters - Van Gogh, Toulouse-lautrec And Manet - And The 'canonical' Artists Of Feminist Art History, Artemisia Gentileschi And Mary Cassatt. Pollock Avoids Both An Unnuanced Critique Of Masculine Canons And An Unquestioning Celebration Of Women Artists.

Ordinary people plunge into insurmountable personal debt and fall prey to dangerous webs of underground creditors-so dangerous, in fact, that murder may be the only way out. A beautiful young woman vanishes, and the detective quickly finds she is not whom she claims to be. Is she a victim, a killer, or both? In a country that tracks its citizens at every turn, how can two women claim the same identity and then disappear without a trace?<p></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The horror in this beautifully fashioned tale of stolen identity lies not in the cold-blooded crimes but in the motive-a desperate hunger for consumer goods. Shunsuke Honma, a widowed 43-year-old Tokyo police inspector with a 10-year-old son, is on disability leave. The boring cycle of idleness punctuated by painful physical therapy sessions comes to a halt when a nephew asks for Honma's help in finding his missing fiance, whom he knows as Shoko Sekine. As Honma's search intensifies, he realizes the fiance had actually assumed Sekine's identity and possibly killed her. For the American reader, the jewel in this enormously compelling novel is the portrait of working- and middle-class Japanese getting caught in a cycle of astronomical personal debt in order to enjoy the good life. Also eye-opening is Japan's elaborate registry system for keeping track of its citizenry. In order to become Shoko Sekine, the impostor had to perpetrate an ingeniously elaborate series of hoaxes and lies. Honma is tenacious, methodical, an attentive listener with a retentive memory and the ability to connect disparate bits of information. The trail takes him back through the real Sekine's history and into the life of the other woman, whose family ran afoul of vicious loan sharks. Miyabe drives her complex plot with spare prose, combining expert pacing and psychological nuance to ultimately haunting effect. (Feb.) FYI: All She Was worth was named Best Novel of the year and Best Mystery for 1992 in Japan.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",13.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/87/9780395966587.jpg,Success

For Rosezella Maynette Fisher, outspoken sister girl and controversial Dean of Students at Harvard Law School, it was murder. And the debonair new President of Harvard is a prime suspect. A Darker Shade of Crimson is a novel about how Ella Fisher ended up dead on the first day of the fall semester, and how her friend Veronica (Nikki) Chase - a smart, ambitious, attractive, and well-connected black economics professor - sets out to solve the crime, and in the process uncovers some of Harvard's most deeply buried secrets. At twenty-eight, Nikki is a rising star, the only black professor in Harvard's economics department. After stumbling over Ella Fisher's body during a blackout in a classroom building, she is quickly plunged into the investigation of her death. With the occasional tip from Raphael Griffin, a Harvard policeman, Nikki learns that plenty of people could have wanted Ella dead. Only two people seem to mourn Ella's passing: her blue-blooded, Wellesley-educated secretary, Lindsey Wentworth; and Ella's best girlfriend, Alix Coulter, an actress from Texas with attitude. With their help, Nikki sets out to unravel simultaneously the mystery of Ella's death and the complications of her own love life. Dante Rosario, her long-lost ex-boyfriend, turns up and sets off a chemical reaction; meanwhile, Justin Simms, a Harvard Law School student who flirts like a master, won't take no for an answer.

Not that the fans of self-reliant PI Kinsey Millhone's 13 previous alphabet appearances (from 1982's <i>A Is for Alibi</i> through 1996's <i>M Is for Malice</i>) are likely to object. This story takes Kinsey away from her Southern California coastal town of Santa Teresa to the small mountain community of Nota Lake in the Sierras. There, Selma Newquist hires Kinsey to ferret out the problem that had been seriously bothering her cop husband, Tom, before his recent death from a heart attack. Kinsey's efforts are soon stonewalled as the residents of Nota Lake unite, suggesting that the widow is being troublesome while the good-guy cop should be left to rest in peace. Kinsey wonders whether the townspeople might be right until she is seriously beaten up in her Nota Lake motel room. Focusing on finding the dead man's missing notebook, she follows his trail to a seedy hotel not far from Santa Teresa that he visited a few weeks before his death. While keeping a suspicious eye on the dead man's police partner and a few other local figures, Kinsey determines that Tom Newquist had been investigating an old murder near Nota Lake, which may have had ties to a similar, recent murder. Lots of coincidences, some over-the top characters, including a hyper-raunchy older woman, and some unprepared-for elements contribute to the rather chaotic climax. But Grafton's easy-reading, intelligent prose and her heroine's sharp humor, served up dark and wry, make up for a slew of plot weaknesses. Mystery Guild main selection; Literary Guild selection.

1-57392-264-1,The Wandering Womb : A Cultural History of Outrageous Beliefs About Woman,"Thompson, Lana",Prometheus,208,1999-02-01,Hardcover,"<p>Female anatomy, especially the womb, has for centuries been shrouded in mystery and misunderstanding, defining the social place of women in male dominated cultures. Even with advances in medicine, some in today's society believe they can control women's sexual identity.</p>
<p>The Wandering Womb is a provocative tour through religious, medical, and social histories, pinpointing humorous, outrageous, and hair-raising beliefs, practices, and longstanding falsehoods that permeate human cultures. In Egyptian times, it was believed that the womb was an entity unto itself capable of ""wandering"" in the body, and also into the world beyond in search of nourishment! This idea, and many others were entwined in medical ignorance and religious superstition, which have often labeled women as incomplete, inferior, imperfect, and even inherently evil.</p>
<p>Sexual myths have viewed menstruation as dirty, designing outrageous rituals around this natural process, from strange diets and prescriptions to mandated isolation and violent practices. Sexuality and desire in women has been viewed as taboo and dangerous, while child rearing is considered the highest calling. In Western history, women's health problems were often written off simply as an ""unsatisfied uterus,"" or ""hysteria"" of their weak and demon possessed bodies, while physical characteristics were used to label women as witches.</p>
<p>This fascinating, often maddening romp through the bedrooms and birthing rooms of time illustrates why women have been sexually ""enslaved,"" and reminds us that we've come a long way from the mythical virgin birth to women's liberation and beyond.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.94 Inches, Length: 6.45 Inches, Weight: 1.04058187664 Pounds, Width: 0.74 Inches",27.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/47/9781573922647.jpg,Success

Pamela's son Bim dies on the Somme, and his sacrifice is accepted ""as if death lies in the faint outline of garden where it merges with rushes and reedbeds."" Gradually, we encounter Emma herself, a lonely child left at the family estate, Glen, during World War II, witnessing the mysterious comings and goings of her extended family including her aunt, the wayward, thrice-married Clare. The penultimate chapter portrays the decline of Emma's uncle, the famous aesthete Stephen Tennant, who was written about by V. S. Naipaul in The Enigma of the Arrival.",en,,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.85098433132 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",22.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/94/9780811214094.jpg,Success

Bolton's earliest impressions of her parents are vague - both died of cholera when she was very young - and her memories begin when the five orphaned Miller children are sent to live with their maternal grandmother. In the elegant rooms of her mansion and in the unkempt gardens surrounding the estate, Mary and her identical twin sister Grace find a sheltering refuge. The shared history of the twins is at the book's heart. It was never I but always we. Bolton writes. But then tragedy strikes, and in this exquisite example of the art of memoir writing, Bolton lyrically recreates the emotional bond which, 68 years later, remained palpably alive.",en,First Paperback,"Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",2.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/86/9781883642686.jpg,Success

Her tenth book consists of a single long poem whose sentences, segments and prose-blocks weave loosely around and about, and grow out of, a road trip through the rural South. Clipped twangs, lyrical goblets of magnolialight, and recurrent, mysterious, semi-allegorical figures like the snakeman and the boneman share space with place names, lexicographies, exhortations and wacky graffiti (God is Louise). Wright alternates private references with clear allusions, as when images of eye enucleations and glass eyes culminate in a flurry of bits from King Lear. Deepstep teems with wry, rich sentences no one else could have written: I left my chicory-blue swimsuit back at the motel where the baseball team cannonballed us out of the pool. She leaps exhilaratingly among verbal registers--from kenatoprosthesis to trailer skirt, from Arkansas toe and pinball to Ultima Thule. And she loves double meanings--Morning glories. What's yours. Her uncharacteristically extroverted, ethnographic project also shows her sense of humor--Her Aunt Flo said she hadn't had any in so long she'd done growed back together. In sorting these glittering, interlocking fragments of self-conscious Southern poetry, preposterous as a wedding dress, some readers will wish Wright had included notes, or explained her extensive back story; but no one will need more information to cherish Wright's latest once-and-for-all thing, opaque and revelatory, ceaselessly burning.

Each chapter investigates one of these aspects and ends with appropriate spiritual exercises. A minister for over 30 years who has conducted seminars on spiritual healing, Grayson by contrast stresses 13 principles for self-healing.

0-231-11325-0,Willa Cather: Queering America,"Lindemann, Marilee",Columbia University Press,190,1999-02-15,Paperback,"<p>Although it has been proven posthumously by scholars that Willa Cather had lesbian relationships, she did not openly celebrate lesbian desire, and even today is sometimes described as homophobic and misogynistic. What, then, can a reassessment of this contentious first lady of American letters add to an understanding of the gay identities that have emerged in America over the past century? As Marilee Lindemann shows in this study of the novelist's life and work, Cather's sexual coming-of-age occurred at a time when a cultural transition was recasting love between women as sexual deviance rather than romantic friendship. At the same time, the very identity of ""America"" was characterized by great instability as the United States emerged as a modern industrial nation and imperial power. Indeed, both terms, ""queer"" and ""America,"" achieved fresh ideological potency at the turn of the century. <i>Willa Cather: Queering America</i> is an enlightening unpacking of Cather's writings, from her controversial love letters of the 1890s--in which ""queer"" is employed to denote sexual deviance--to her epic novels, short stories, and critical writings. Lindemann points to the ""queer"" qualities of Cather's fiction--rebellion against traditional fictional form, with sometimes unlikable characters, lack of emphasis on heroic action, and lack of engagement in the drama of heterosexual desire.</p>

0-231-10849-4,Gay Science,"Murphy, Timothy",Columbia University Press,320,1999-04-15,Paperback,"<p><i>Gay Science</i> is the first comprehensive examination of the ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation research. Bioethicist Timothy Murphy presents the views of many gay men and women who detect ominous motives behind this research. If a genetic marker were discovered for homosexual tendencies would genetic screening be used to further discriminate against gay people? If a method for changing sexual orientation were developed would it would be forced upon gay adults, or children whose parents suspected they might grow up to be gay. Given the potential for its misuse, is sexual orientation research fundamentally unethical?</p>
<p>Murphy acknowledges that much of sexual orientation research to date has been bad science, questionable in its motives and methodologically unsound. He examines the social and historical conditions, from the 1880s to the present, that spawned this research and reviews the findings that have often perpetuated confusion about homosexuality. He assesses five major studies on sexual orientation undertaken in the 1990s, from neuroanatomist Simon leVay's study of certain brain structures in gay men to the work of psychologist Joseph Nicolosi. He questions the flawed and simplistic assumptions about sexuality made by much of this research, Murphy argues that a true science of sexual orientation would not be focused exclusively upon homosexuality nor presuppose its pathology.</p>
<p>Throughout the book Murphy argues that concerns about the potential misuses of this research do not justify its prohibition. Tackling gay science's most troubling aspects, he contends that if this research leads to the development of effective sexual orientation therapies, informed adults should have the choice to undergo them; he also examines the factors that weigh in favor of a parental right to choose or attempt to influence the sexual orientation of a child, and the ethical limits to such a right.</p>
<p>Pointing to the potential benefits of sexual orientation research as well as acknowledging its potential for harm, Murphy ultimately defends gay science in the name of free scientific inquiry. <i>Gay Science</i> argues that the way to ensure the future of gay people is not through censoring sexual orientation research but through working toward a society which uses reseach as a way of dinstinguishing myth from fact and not as an instrument of discrimination.</p>

Halley explains how the military's new anti-gay policy is fundamentally misdescribed by its common nickname, 'Don't Ask/Don't Tell.' This ubiquitous phrase, she points out, implies that it discharges servicemembers not for who they are, but for what they do. It insinuates that, as long as military personnel keep quiet about their homosexual orientation and desist from 'homosexual conduct,' no one will try to pry them out of their closets and all will be well.<br>Not so, reveals Halley. In order to work through the steps by which the new law was ultimately drafted, she opens with a close reading of the 1986 Supreme Court sodomy case which served as the legal and rhetorical model for the policy revisions made in 1993. Halley also describes how the Clinton administrationâs attempts to offer Congress an opportunity to regulate conduct-and not status-were flatly rejected and not included in the final statute. Using cultural and critical theory seldom applied to explain the law, Halley argues that, far from providing privacy and an assurance that servicemembers' careers will be ruined only if they engage in illegal conduct, the rule activates a culture of minute surveillance in which every member must strictly avoid using any gesture in an ever-evolving lexicon of 'conduct that manifests a propensity.' In other words, not only homosexuals but <i>all</i> military personnel are placed in danger by the new policy. After challenging previous pro-gay arguments against the policy that have failed to expose its most devious and dangerous elements, Halley ends with a persuasive discussion about how it is both unconstitutional and, politically, an act of sustained bad faith.<br>This knowledgeable and eye-opening analysis of one of the most important public policy debates of the 1990s will interest legal scholars, policymakers, activists, military historians and personnel, as well as citizens concerned about issues of discrimination.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.03 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches",20.85,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/74/9780822323174.jpg,Success

0-8223-2342-7,Out Takes: Essays on Queer Theory and Film (Series Q),"Hanson, Ellis",Duke University Press Books,376,1999-05-03,Paperback,"<p>This collection brings together the work of both film scholars and queer theorists to advance a more sophisticated notion of queer film criticism. While the “politics of representation” has been the focus of much previous gay and lesbian film criticism, the contributors to <i>Out Takes</i> employ the approaches of queer theory to move beyond conventional readings and to reexamine aspects of the cinematic gaze in relation to queer desire and spectatorship.</p>
<p>The essays examine a wide array of films, including <i>Calamity Jane</i>, <i>Rear Window,</i> <i>The Hunger</i>, <i>Heavenly Creatures</i>, and <i>Bound</i> , and discuss such figures as Doris Day, Elizabeth Taylor, and Alfred Hitchcock. Divided into three sections, the first part reconsiders the construction of masculinity and male homoerotic desire—especially with respect to the role of women—in classic cinema of the 1940s and 1950s. The second section offers a deconstructive consideration of lesbian film spectatorship and lesbian representation. Part three looks at the historical trajectory of independent queer cinema, including works by H.D., Kenneth Anger, and Derek Jarman.</p>
<p>By exploring new approaches to the study of sexuality in film, <i>Out Takes</i> will be useful to scholars in gay and lesbian studies, queer theory, and cinema studies.</p>

0-8223-2346-X,"Queer in Russia: A Story of Sex, Self, and the Other","Essig, Laurie",Duke University Press Books,272,1999-07-15,Paperback,"<p>In <i>Queer in Russia</i> Laurie Essig examines the formation of gay identity and community in the former Soviet Union. As a sociological fieldworker, she began her research during the late 1980s, before any kind of a public queer identity existed in that country. After a decade of conducting interviews, as well as observing and analyzing plays, books, pop music, and graffiti, Essig presents the first sustained study of how and why there was no Soviet gay community or even gay identity before <i>perestroika</i> and the degree to which this situation has-or has not-changed.<br>While male homosexual acts were criminalized in Russia before 1993, women attracted to women were policed by the medical community, who saw them less as criminals than as diseased persons potentially cured by drug therapy or transsexual surgery. After describing accounts of pre-<i>perestroika</i> persecution, Essig examines the more recent state of sexual identities in Russia. Although the fall of communism brought new freedom to Russian queers, there are still no signs of a mass movement forming around the issue, and few identify themselves as lesbians or gay men, even when they are involved in same-sex relations. Essig does reveal, however, vibrant manifestations of gay life found at the local level-in restaurants, discos, clubs, and cruising strips, in newspapers, journals, literature, and the theater. Concluding with a powerful exploration of the surprising affinities between some of Russiaâs most prominent nationalists and its queers, <i>Queer in Russia</i> fills a gap in both Russian and cultural studies.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.23899791244 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/64/9780822323464.jpg,Success

<p>From her earliest novel, <i>Desert of the Heart</i> (1964), Rule's fiction has provided a challenge to the concept of a fixed identity and to the identity politics founded on such a concept. Incorporating all of Jane Rule's early work-including unpublished manuscripts, letters, magazine and newspaper columns, as well as fan mail she received-Schuster also draws on interviews, conversations, and personal encounters with the author to elicit the ways in which Rule interrogates the meanings and politics of sexuality, the relationship between sexuality and language, and the stakes of communities in individual claims on identity.</p>

Using the Colorado initiative as his focus, Gerstmann untangles the complex standards and subtle rhetoric the Supreme Court uses to apply the equal protection clause. <br><br>The Court divides people into legal classes that receive varying levels of protection; gays and lesbians and other groups, such as the elderly and the poor, receive the least. Gerstmann reveals how these standards are used to favor certain groups over others, and also how Amendment 2 advocates used the Court's doctrine to convince voters that gays and lesbians were seeking special rights in Colorado.<br><br>Concluding with a call for wholesale reform of equal-protection jurisprudence, this book is essential reading for anyone interested in fair, coherent, and truly equal protection under the law.<br><br></p> <h3>Law and Politics Book Review - Kenneth D. Wald</h3> <p>I found Gerstmann's <I>Constitutional Underclass</i> a keen indictment of current judicial doctrine about equal protection. The volume lays bare the legal obstacles to gay-lesbian equality in the United States. I join the author in the modest hope that this book will shift the conversation about equal protection to a more fruitful plane.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches",79.49,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/04/9780226288604.jpg,Success
0-226-72180-9,Gay Lives: Homosexual Autobiography from John Addington Symonds to Paul Monette,"Robinson, Paul",University of Chicago Press,456,1999-03-01,Hardcover,"<p>In his autobiography, John Addington Symonds relates a glorious night of passion, in which he and his lover ""lay covered from the cold in bed, tasting the honey of softly spoken words and the blossoms of lips pressed on lips."" Christopher Isherwood's first autobiography, on the other hand, was far less direct; he wrote a second autobiography in part because the first was ""not truly autobiographical"" in that ""the author conceals important facts about himself."" These contradictions, evasions, and explicit sexual details of the life stories of fourteen men form <i>Gay Lives</i>, a revealing account of homosexual autobiography.</p>
<p>Paul Robinson reads the memoirs of French, British, and American gay authors—André Gide, Quentin Crisp, and Martin Duberman, among others—through the prism of sexual identity, asking fascinating questions about homosexuality and its relation to literary form. How did these authors discover their sexual identity? Did they embrace it or reject it? How did they express often conflicted desires in their words, which ranged from defiant and brutally frank to ambiguous and abstract? Robinson considers the choices each made—as a man and an author—to accommodate himself to society's homophobia or live in protest against his oppression.</p>
<p>Despite the threads that connect these stories, <i>Gay Lives</i> refutes the notion that there is a typical homosexual ""career"" by showing that gay men have led wildly dissimilar lives—from the exuberant to the miserable—and that they have found no less dissimilar meanings in those lives.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.375 Inches, Weight: 2.12525620568 Pounds, Width: 1.6 Inches",41,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/04/9780226721804.jpg,Success
0-226-56849-0,Gay Men's Friendships : Invincible Communities,"Nardi, Peter M.",University of Chicago Press,264,1999-07-15,Paperback,"<p><P>Based on surveys and interviews of two hundred gay men, Peter Nardi's new study presents the first book-length examination of contemporary urban gay men's friendships. Expertly weaving historical and sociological research on friendship with firsthand information, Nardi argues that friendship is the central organizing element of gay men's lives. Through friendship, gay identities and communities are created, transformed, maintained, and reproduced. <br><br>Nardi explores the meaning of friends to some gay men, how friends often become a surrogate family, how sexual behavior and attraction affects these friendships, and how, for many, friends mean more and last longer than romantic relationships. While looking at the psychological joys and sorrows of friendship, he also considers the cultural constraints limiting gay men in contemporary urban America&#8212;especially those that deal with dominant images of masculinity and heterosexuality&#8212;and how they relate to friendship. <br><br>By listening to gay men talk about their interactions, Nardi offers a rare glimpse into the mechanisms of gay life. We learn how gay men meet their friends, what they typically do and talk about, and how these strong relationships contain the roots of larger cultural forces such as social movements and gay identities and neighborhoods. Nardi also points out the political and social consequences when friendships fail to provide support against oppression. <br><br>An intimate and informative look at gay life in urban America, <i>Gay Men's Friendships</i> ultimately shows how these relationships challenge the gender order of our society by questioning how masculinity is constructed and by offering a modelfor a more creative blending of gay and heterosexual masculinity.<br><br><br><br></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Exploring what Hannah Arendt called ""the political relevance of friendship,"" Nardi, a professor of sociology at Claremont College, argues that a tremendous amount of gay political organizing emerges from the bonds between gay men. Although he contends that gay male friendships are ""poorly understood"" and ""not easily explained,"" he claims that friendship is the primary community institution for urban gay men. In addition to a review of the existing literature of male friendship (from Aristotle and Cicero to current popular and scholarly work), Nardi offers his own research findings, based on 161 questionnaires and 30 face-to-face interviews. While many of his conclusions seem like obvious common sense (such as his claim that many gay men choose not to have sex with their friends for fear of losing the friendship), he also offers some provocative flashes of insight (for example, that gay men's social circles have become less diverse in terms of class and race as political groups and social venues have proliferated and become more specialized). While Nardi attempts a blend of sociology and cultural history, overall, the latter element is more successful; when he lets his subjects speak, the book vibrates with lived experience. In particular, his discussions of the legal ramifications of gay men creating ""family"" out of friendships (e.g., friends do not have the legal rights to visit the critically ill in a hospital) are important contributions to the growing literature of gay sociology.
