At the end of the year they discovered that they had created something richer—they'd written a joyous meditation on living with integrity. 
<p>While the letters were being written, Carol suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Despite pain and sleep deprivation, she joined Dorothy in recording the cycles of their beloved gardens. She also kept a private journal of her struggle with illness. Excerpts from her journal are an integral part of <i>Between Gardens</i>, providing a poignant counterpoint to the vibrant letters. Dorothy's photographs and handmade paper accompany the words, expressing her acute perception of the natural world.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",18.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/54/9781896095554.jpg,Success

<p>THE MOUNTAIN</p>
<p>I: A Metaphor</p>
<p>The mountain as metaphor looms large in the lives of marginalized people, people whose bones get crushed in the grind of capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy. How many of us have struggled up the mountain, measured ourselves against the mountain, failed on the mountain, lived in the shadow of the mountain, hit our heads on glass ceilings, tried to climb the class ladder, lost the fight against assimilation, struggled our way toward that phantom called normality?</p>
<p>We hear from the summit that the world is the best from up there. Hear that we are lazy, stupid, weak, ugly, that we live at the bottom precisely because we are those things. We decide to climb that mountain, or make a pact that our children will climb it. The climbing turns out to be unimaginably difficult. We are afraid; every time we look ahead we can find nothing remotely familiar or comfortable. We lose the trail. Our wheelchairs get stuck. We speak the wrong languages with the wrong accents, wear the wrong clothes, carry our bodies the wrong ways, ask the wrong questions, love the wrong people. And it's goddamn lonely up there on the mountain. We decide to stop climbing and build a new house right where we are. Or we decide to climb back down to the people we love where the food, the clothes, the dirt, the sidewalk, the steaming asphalt under our feet, our crutches all feel right. Or we find the path again, decide to continue climbing only to have the very people who told us how wonderful life is at the summit booby trap the trail. They burn the bridge over the impassable canyon. They redraw our topo maps so that we end up walking in circles. They send their goons-those working-class and poor people they employ as their official brutes-to push us over the edge. Maybe we get to the summit but p</p>",en,,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches",14,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/50/9780896086050.jpg,Success
1-55597-294-2,Northern Waters,"Grover, Jan Zita",Graywolf Press,236,1999-09-01,Paperback,"<p><P>Jan Zita Grover brings to her writing on fly fishing a fresh eye, a lyric prose style and an original and thoughtful take on the world, a combination of talents that makes <i>Northern Waters</i> one of the most engaging books on rivers, woods, and fishing I've read in a good long while.&#151;W.D. Wetherell, author of <i>One River More</i><P>Grover came to angling late and seems hell-bent on making up for lost time. But <i>Northern Waters</i> is more than just a fishing memoir. It's the chronicle of a woman profoundly and passionately engaged in the natural world. With intelligence, clarity, and considerable literary skill, Grover reminds us that the world is richer than we supposed, more complex, more fertile, more surprising&#151;and that it's time we rolled up our sleeves and got down to the messy business of being alive.&#151;Jerry Dennis, author of <i>The River Home</i><P><i>Northern Waters</i> is my favorite kind of fishing book&#58; part memoir, part history, and all engaging commentary on what makes fishermen the way we are. It is also a splendid celebration of the north woods and their often imperiled magic.&#151;Paul Schullery, author of <i>Royal Coachman</i><P>Many of us have, as Jan Zita Grover writes, submitted ourselves 'to the tutelage of waters.' But few pupils have proved so adept. Grover is a writer of uncommon gifts, as deft and graceful as she is tough-minded.&#151;Ted Leeson, co-author of <i>The Fly Tier's Benchside Reference</i><P><b>Jan Zita Grover</b> is a transplanted San Franciscan now happily living in northern Minnesota. She is also the author of <i>North Enough&#58; AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts</i>.</p> <h3>Library Journal</h3> <p>Though ostensibly about fly-fishing, this book never talks about catching fish; it is instead a detailed examination of the Midwest--written by a native Californian. Although not a spectacular writer, Grover (North Enough: AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts) does have a keen eye for nature and our impact on the environment. (The waters Grover writes about--in the north woods of Minnesota and Wisconsin--have been familiar to me for 25 years, but she surprised me with her observations.) These challenging essays primarily explore an angler's engagement with the natural world, but they also take on Great Lakes salmon stocking, lampreys, dams, and fishing in Montana (which Midwestern anglers regard as our reward for surviving our winters). Many fly-fishing converts have been driven to write about the sport; few have succeeded as well as Grover. Although there are a few glaring factual errors, this is for the most part a thought-provoking work. Recommended for all fly-fishing collections, especially those in Wisconsin and Minnesota.--Jeff Grossman, Milwaukee Area Technical Coll.

Until now, however, no one has written the story of this woman of extraordinary talent and notoriety. She was a great beauty, an aristocratic refugee of the Russian Revolution, and a frankly erotic painter who insisted upon Renaissance aesthetics, figuration, and painterly craft in modern art. The sky-high prices attached to her canvases in recent years have still not dispelled the suspicions that a woman of Lempicka's glamour and fame could be a truly serious artist. Yet the reviews of the early twentieth century tell a different story: her work was routinely singled out as competing with major figures of the School of Paris, including Léger, Laurençin, Kisling, and Picasso.
<p>In this first critical biography, Laura Claridge draws upon her exclusive access to Lempicka's family, friends, and archives to re-create the life that the painter carefully withheld even from her own daughter: the truth of her birth; her escape from Bolshevik Russia; her determination to become a New Woman; her lifelong bouts of depression; her numerous affairs with the women and men she painted; her flight from Nazi Europe via Havana; and her years in Hollywood and New York as the ""Baroness with a brush,"" all informed by the artistic integrity and social anachronism that condemned her to being written out of the canons of modern art.</p>
<p>Emblematic of '20s excess and indulgence, Tamara de Lempicka's life of great wealth, indiscriminate sexuality, and endless intrigue makes for a fascinating narrative. But her paintings have inspired fierce disagreements over issues of class, wealth, and gender in modern art, making her work ripe for critical re-evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence, Laura Claridge has succeeded brilliantly on both counts, bringing to light the contradictions that fueled the life and work of this provocative painter.</p>
<p>Though Paris in the early twenties certainly earned its bohemian reputation, Tamara was playing the game hard by anyone's standards. It seemed to her that she could have it all: respect, money, and sexual gratification on the side. She had arrived at the Gare du Nord only four years earlier, gifted with a painter's talent and a family history of feminine power. Encountering a cultural climate that affirmed art as a remunerative career for women, she also felt freed personally by the Modernist mantra to ""make it new"" that underwrote every aspect--trivial and profound--of daily life. She was determined to embody that icon of the age, the new woman.</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.95 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",35,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/75/9780517705575.jpg,Success

The story then shifts to the tundra of Siberia, where, at the same time, a young woman identified only as Fika is trying to make her way from the Soviet Union to freedom. As the novel unfolds, these two seemingly unrelated events-literally worlds apart-become key pieces in Bowering's astonishing fictional puzzle.</p><p>&nbsp;That puzzle is assembled by Albrecht Storr, one of twin sons of German immigrants, who becomes the primary narrator of the novel. Looking back to 1935, when he, his brother Gerhard, and Nate were children together, Albrecht slowly recounts a chain of extraordinary events set off when Nate, still suffering from the death of his sister, kidnaps an infant girl. That reckless, long undetected act leaves few lives unaffected, and will lead, a quarter of a century later, to Fika's remarkable journey across the spare, life-threatening, yet inconceivably beautiful frozen landscape.</p>",en,English Language,"Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.66 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/68/9780060929268.jpg,Success

In her bereavement, she creates a past in which she might both lose and find herself: a 15th-century village in a land of saints and spirits, inexplicable afflictions and miraculous awakenings. With a band of pilgrims - among them an old man, his pregnant daughter, a priest, a dying woman, and a leper - she discovers a beached mermaid, watches a priest drive madness from a woman's mouth, enters a mossy forest inhabited by a hunted man covered in shaggy hair, and witnesses a map being digested in the belly of a ravenous woman. Moving effortlessly between the magical and the real, the past and the present, the journey of the narrator and her companions transcends the physical terrain and becomes a fantastical quest for rebirth.

Her brief adventure in the Book of Genesis is where the Western idea of woman began, and three thousand years after Eve offered Adam the forbidden fruit, everyone still knows that losing Paradise was Eve's fault.<p> <p>Pamela Norris traces the evolution of Eve's bad reputation, drawing on a rich and diverse tradition of storytelling that embraces myth, folk tale and popular romance, and puts the spotlight firmly on women and their sexuality. From Dinah and Delilah, Pandora and Psyche, to the snaky Lamias and Liliths who haunted nineteenth-century painting and literature, centuries of disobedient women have been linked with Eve, the original bad girl, providing ample ammunition for male fears and fantasies. But Eve's story has also been retold by women, who have found ingenious and often subversive ways to free her from her disreputable past.<p> <p>Stimulating, intriguing and wittily erudite, <b>Eve&#58; A Biography </b>is the entrancing tale of a folk maiden who metamorphoses into a vamp, a mermaid, a bluestocking, a witch, a virgin trapped inside the walls of a fertile garden and finally, perhaps, into a thoroughly modern woman who chews the apple of knowledge with gusto and wouldn't dream of offering Adam a bite.<p></p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>According to Norris, the history of sexism can be illuminated through the evolving interpretation of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Beginning her comparative study with ancient Greek myths, she equates Eve with Pandora, whose curiosity brought evil into the world. Classical writers considered women to be troublemakers: Aristotle was noted for his ""scientific"" theory that the female was an imperfect male. Norris cites chapter and verse from Old and New Testament and apocryphal writings, medieval works and those of more recent writers ranging from Charlotte Bront to Anita Brookner. Twelve color plates of works by such masters as Piero della Francesca and Hieronymus Bosch represent the traditional view of Eve as a seductive beauty tempting Adam to sin. According to Genesis, Eve's punishment was the pain of childbirth and eternal submission to her husband, who is also condemned to labor for his bread. Both were cast out of the Garden of Eden, losing the gift of eternal life. While the early Christian church fathers regarded Eve as ""the Devil's gateway"" and ""the first deserter of the divine law,"" other commentators have given the story a more favorable reading. The fall was a felix culpa (""happy fault""), when the two, led by Eve, first took responsibility for their destiny. Writers continue to be fascinated by Eve, but, Norris warns, the myth of Eve ""was developed to manipulate and control women rather than to console them."" Erudite but eminently accessible, Norris's account of how religious beliefs and cultural forces have affected prevailing views of women is an important addition to the literature of women's studies.

Among feminists, two fundamentally differing views of women in the military have developed. Feminist antimilitarists tell us that militarism and patriarchy have together pressed women into second class citizenship. Meanwhile, feminist soldiers and their advocates regard martial service as women's right and responsibility and the ticket to first class citizenship.</p>
<p><b>Citizenship Rites</b> investigates what is at stake for women in these debates. Exploring the perspectives of both feminist antimilitarists and feminist soldiers, Ilene Feinman situates the current combat controversy within the context of the sea change in United States politics since the 1970s-from ERA debates over drafting women to recent representations of military women such as the film <i>GI Jane</i>. Drawing on congressional testimony, court cases, feminist and antiracist political discourse, and antimilitarist activism, Feinman addresses our pressing need for an analysis of women's increasing inclusion in the armed forces while providing a provocative investigation of what this changing role means for women and society alike.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",26,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/91/9780814726891.jpg,Success

Consider Janet Todd's history a bouquet heaped upon that grave.
<p>Aphra Behn (1640?- 1689), poet, playwright; novelist, traveller, and spy, was the first woman to earn her living as a writer. Myths held her to be the illegitimate daughter of Lady Mary Wroth or an American courtesan. Janet Todd's definitive literary biography, using recently discovered documents in England and The Netherlands, firmly establishes Behn as a English-woman of humble beginnings who transformed herself into one of most prominent Restoration playwrights.</p>
<p>Behn's works, of which Oroonoko and The Rover remain the most well known, are openly erotic, with much political critique and an understanding of the complexities of race. Behn's daring writing and relationships with Nell Gwyn, the Stuart kings, and the Duchess of Mazarine made her a byword for sexual licence.</p>

Though physicians of the era admitted that breastfeeding was the best method of infant feeding, they warned of the difficulties that nursing mothers faced, and many held that successful breastfeeding required a knowledge of science and medicine that most new mothers could not claim. Started by seven Catholic women who simply wished to help their friends learn to breastfeed, La Leche League grew into an organization with several million members worldwide, known here and abroad for its pathbreaking promotion of the breastfeeding of infants.</p><p>Offering a fascinating look inside an organization whose full history has been essentially untold, Jule Ward explores the genesis, theological underpinnings, and development of La Leche League. She demonstrates that, despite distancing itself from any overt expression of its religious roots, the organization remains a quasi-religious articulation of Catholic social thought blended with scientific ideology and feminism. In short, says Ward, the story of La Leche League provides an excellent example of how religion in practice permeates everyday life.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.82011961464 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/16/9780807847916.jpg,Success

The second volume plunges into the White House years and the Great Depression, the time when Eleanor exerted enormous influence over the course of the country. In the thirties, Eleanor becomes even more surprising and multifaceted. A loyal wife, a devoted mother, a woman who courted romance and adventure, Eleanor Roosevelt was America's most compelling, charismatic, and visionary First Lady. She ran a virtual parallel administration that championed civil rights, affordable housing, and a New Deal for women. She took unpopular stands and often countered her husband's policies, particularly concerning racial justice, women's rights, the plight of refugees, and approaches to Fascism and the Spanish Civil War. The book closes in 1938, as Europe moves toward war. This is an unparalleled presentation of a woman whose life was filled with passionate commitment and who struggled for personal fulfillment.

Extensively researched, the story contains actual dialogue and facts of the account. Breathtaking illustrations tell the trip of these two American heroines as it might have been.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this sparkling picture book based on a true incident, Ryan (Riding Freedom, with Selznick) proves that Amelia Earhart and Eleanor Roosevelt truly were birds of a feather. Friends in real life, America's First Lady invited the First Lady of the Air to dinner at the White House in 1933. Eleanor, inspired by Amelia's descriptions of Washington viewed from her plane at night, accepts the pilot's offer of an after-dinner flight over the capital. Before dessert can be served, and over the protests of the Secret Service agents, the two are off to the airport and up in the sky, thrilling to the brilliance of the city below. Hewing closely to documented accounts, Ryan's inviting text adds drama and draws parallels between the two protagonists with fictional touches: she places them alone together in the plane (an author's note explains that in fact they were accompanied by two male pilots) and adds a final scene in which Eleanor takes Amelia for a zippy ride around the city in her brand-new car. Selznick's illustrations, black-and-white graphite accented with touches of purple pencil, both capture the vibrancy of his subjects and evoke the feel of a more glamorous era.

Although Her Historical Importance Was Understood At An Early Date, The Significance Of Her Work - And Her Position As An Essential Figure In Postwar American Art - Has Been Appreciated Only In Recent Decades. Unlike Her Male Colleagues, Who Viewed Painting As A Primal Expression Of The Self, Krasner Saw Her Art As An Open-ended Exploration. Her Complex And Original Works Were Dense With Intellectual And Cultural Suggestion, Incorporating Human And Foliate Forms, Allusions To Myth And Ancient Script, And Deliberate Ambiguity. This Lavishly Illustrated Book, Which Accompanies A Major Traveling Exhibition Of Krasner's Paintings, Brings New Insight To Her Remarkable Achievements. Art Historian Robert Hobbs Takes A Fresh Look At Her Work, Examining Its Forms And Iconography To Reveal The Impressive Originality And Complexity Of Her Creation.

0-292-70470-4,Gordon Conway: Fashioning a New Woman (American Studies Series),"Allen, Raye Virginia",Univ of Texas Pr,368,1997,Paperback,"Gordon Conway became an illustrator for Vanity Fair at the age of twenty and an accomplished fashion artist. She went on to an illustrious career in design that encompassed publicity campaigns for Broadway musicals, costume and set designs for cabaret in Paris, and the management of the first autonomous costume department at a major British film studio. Throughout her career, Conway lived the life she portrayed in her art, combining a cafe and cabaret social life with hard work and a reputation for never missing deadlines. This record of Conway's career, drawn from extensive archival materials never before published, underscores the role that women played in creating the image of the flapper or New Woman of the 1920s, as well as the limits of their influence. This book will be important reading for everyone interested in fashion, design, film and stage history, and Jazz Age society.",en,First Edition,"Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",34.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/01/9780292704701.jpg,Success

I want to enlist art to question the mythical explanations of everyday life that take shape as an optimistic rationalism and to explore the relationships between individual consciousness, family life, and the culture of monopoly capitalism.<p>Since the late 1960s, American artist Martha Rosler has produced seminal works in the fields of photography, performance, video, installation, critical writing, and theory. Committed to an art that engages a public beyond the confines of the art world, Rosler investigates how socioeconomic realities and political ideologies dominate ordinary life. Her astute critical analyses are often cloaked in deadpan wit.</p><p>This book, which accompanies the first retrospective exhibition of Rosler's work, contains seven color photo essays by Rosler; an excerpt from the curatorial project If You Lived Here; essays by Alexander Alberro, Catherine de Zegher, Sylvia Eiblmayr, Jodi Hauptman, and Annette Michelson; a conversation between Rosler and Benjamin Buchloh; and a biography/bibliography along with a complete list of art works.</p><p>EXHIBITION SCHEDULE:</p><p><b>Ikon Gallery</b></p><p>Birmingham, UK</p><p><i>December 1998 - January 1999</i></p><p><b>Nouveau MusÃ©e</b></p><p>Villeurbanne, France</p><p><i>January 1999 - February 1999</i></p><p><b>Generali Foundation</b></p><p>Vienna, Austria</p><p><i>May 1999 - August 1999</i></p><p><b>MACBA</b></p><p>Barcelona, Spain</p><p><i>Fall 1999</i></p><p><b>The New Museum</b></p><p>New York City</p><p><i>Spring 2000</i></p>",en,,"Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 1.9510910187 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",60.32,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/44/9780262041744.jpg,Success

Acclaimed Irish author Emma Donoghue reveals heroines young and old in unexpected alliances—sometimes treacherous, sometimes erotic, but always courageous. Told with luminous voices that shimmer with sensuality and truth, these age-old characters shed their antiquated cloaks to travel a seductive new landscape, radiantly transformed.Cinderella forsakes the handsome prince and runs off with the fairy godmother; Beauty discovers the Beast behind the mask is not so very different from the face she sees in the mirror; Snow White is awakened from slumber by the bittersweet fruit of an unnamed desire. Acclaimed writer Emma Donoghue spins new tales out of old in a magical web of thirteen interconnected stories about power and transformation and choosing one's own path in the world. In these fairy tales, women young and old tell their own stories of love and hate, honor and revenge, passion and deception. Using the intricate patterns and oral rhythms of traditional fairy tales, Emma Donoghue wraps age-old characters in a dazzling new skin.</p>

To cultivate the region's support for the Allies while portraying Brazil and its neighbors as dependable wartime partners, the State Department created the Office of Inter-American Affairs, with Nelson Rockefeller in charge. Genevieve Naylor, a photojournalist previously employed by the Associated Press and the WPA, was sent to Brazil in 1940 by Rockefeller's agency to provide photographs for propaganda. Often balking at her mundane assignments, an independent-minded Naylor produced something far different and far more rich - a stunning collection of over a thousand images that document a rarely seen period in Brazilian history. Accompanied by analysis from Robert M. Levine, this selection of Naylor's photographs offers a unique view of everyday life during one of modern Brazil's least-examined decades.",en,First Edition,"Height: 12.25 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 1.75047036028 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches",29.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/97/9780822321897.jpg,Success

<p>""[Wicomb's] prose is vigorous, textured, lyrical. . . . [She] is a sophisticated storyteller who combines the open-endedness of contemporary fiction with the force of autobiography and the simplicity of family stories.""-Bharati Mukherjee, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p>

She Brings To Life Her Italian-american Upbringing In A Large Extended Family, Capturing The Complexities Of Her Relationship With A Father Who, Hoping To Protect Her Sexual Innocence, Restricted Her Freedom. Shortly After Leaving College, She Found Both Love And Freedom In Perugia, Italy, Where She Was Living On A Fulbright Scholarship And Met Father Harry Browne, A 40-year-old Irish-american Priest.

She is deaf and dumb, but she wasn't born that way. As she turns 40, she realizes that she has been married (since she was 13) to the uncle who raped her when she was five years old. This traumatic revelation triggers her physical disabilities, compelling her to seek refuge in books and letters. Marianna decides to travel after her husband dies and even turns down an attractive marriage proposal in order to be independent for the first time in her life. Maraini's (e.g., Voices, Serpent's Tail, 1997) writing is elegant, and her graphic descriptions of the luxurious life of the aristocracy in sharp contrast to the squalor of the majority living in poverty are quite realistic. The Silent Duchess was made into a movie in 1996.

Because Mamphela Ramphele began her life as a shy child born into the cage of apartheid - and gradually became an activist who helped set South Africa free -her personal story enlarges each reader's sense of possibilities. Because she was part of the Black Consciousness Movement that linked the personal to the political, she teaches us that race, sex, and class are linked, and that enemies can only be defeated if we refuse to imitate them. . . . No matter where or how each of us lives, <i>Across Boundaries</i> gives us a rare leader who teaches us to teach ourselves.-Gloria Steinem</p>
<p>""Stunningly moving and inspiring.""- Marian Wright Edelman, president, Children's Defense Fund</p>
<p>""Survival,"" writes Mamphela Ramphele, ""is a stronger force than the fear of offending others."" Born black and female in apartheid-ruled South Africa, Ramphele went on to become one of the most distinguished women on the African continent - a prominent activist, medical doctor, anthropologist, teacher, university leader, as well as a mother to two sons. <i>Across Boundaries</i> chronicles Ramphele's inspiring journey, and reveals the staggering personal losses that coexisted with her astonishing political and professional achievements. In addition to recounting the fascinating and often gripping events of her life, she describes the personal side of her experiences - her early struggles to maintain dignity and hope in a world that devalued both black people and women; her battles against despair, especially after the murder of her colleague and lover Steven Biko and the death of her third child in infancy; her mistakes and regrets as well as her triumphs.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.80909650154 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches",12.81,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/65/9781558611665.jpg,Success

But, the story belongs to Grandma Gabi, who calms the children after their play with cookies and a story from her own childhood. Grandma Gabi, it seems, grew up in Czechoslovakia during World War II and played a life and death version of hide-and-seek with Nazi soldiers who had invaded her home. The raid was the last in a series of increasing intrusions and restrictions the German government had placed upon all peoples in the countries they'd conquered who didn't belong to their ideal superior race. This book, based on real people and real events, tells a chillingly real story from the child Gabi's point of view. The fact that Grandma Gabi tells the story to her grandchildren happily lessens the suspense about what happened to her personally during the war. But the reality she portrays of being a regular kid who has to endure the gradual loss of friends, family, possessions, and routines of normal life comes through hauntingly in this well-crafted, relentless, and unforgettable tale of courage, oppression, and love. 1999, Second Story Press, Ages 8 up, $4.95.

Haunted by the harsh words of her domineering mother, who demanded that she suppress her tomboyish tendencies during her childhood, Aline has become a demure, passive, conventional woman. She fails to recognize the man standing before her, who the author names Orlanda. The body belongs to that of Lucien Lèfrene, a lithe 20-year-old rock journalist, but it is inhabited by her once silenced spirit, and possesses her knowledge, memories, and desires, including her love of men.<br>
When the two meet again in Belgium, Aline subconsciously sheds her prim tendencies for more assertive behavior, as she begins to understand that the audacious and lively Orlanda was born from her psyche. The more time the two spend together, the less time they can stand to be apart.<br>
Winner of the Prix Meacutedicis, this lyrical novel, which recalls the erudition and imagination of Michael Cunningham's The Hours, and Patricia Duncker's Hallucinating Foucault, is a stunning evocation of a woman who is forced to confront every part of her soul, and embrace herself whole.</p>",en,1,"Height: 8.54 Inches, Length: 5.8 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches",22,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/15/9781583220115.jpg,Success

The signed articles range from half a page to about six pages and provide at least a minimal bibliography and cross references. There are entries on narrow topics that one would expect, such as Stonewall and Daughters of Bilitis, as well as biographies of both historical and contemporary figures. Unexpected broader topics, such as gentrification and social work, are also featured because they have played a role in gay or lesbian culture and history. Some people and events are hidden within these broader articles, but each volume has a lengthy index. The earlier Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, edited by Wayne Dynes (LJ 1/90), was criticized for not addressing lesbian history adequately, and Zimmerman and Haggerty state that they chose to produce two separate volumes to ensure that both histories receive full and unbiased attention. Users, however, would have been better served by a single alphabetical arrangement or, at least, a shared index. One who knows nothing about the Mattachine Society, for example, would be forced to check both volumes before finding the relevant information. The editors acknowledge making different choices about content and emphasis, and there is some inconsistency. Thus, there is an entry for contemporary mystery writer Michael Nava but none for Sandra Scoppettone or Katherine Forrest. Overall, however, these are fine scholarly works that belong in the reference section of every library.--Debra Moore, Loyola Marymount Univ., Los Angeles Copyright 2000 Cahners BusinessInformation.</p>",en,ILLUSTRATE,"Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 4.5635688234 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches",259.06,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/04/9780815318804.jpg,Success

0-86571-395-2,Boys Will Be Men,"Kivel, Paul",New Society Publishers,256,1999-08-15,Paperback,"<p>While the women's liberation movement produced dynamic changes in society's assumptions about girls' roles, little has changed about our attitude toward the role of boys. Yet the cycle of violence and oppression, specifically that which is killing so many young people and especially boys, will not stop until boys are raised to become part of the struggle to end it.<br>
<br>
Drawing on his decades of experience as a social activist and his anti-violence work with men and teens, Kivel challenges the traditional training boys receive. He sorts out and helps parents grapple with the complex forces in our sons' lives, including racism, homophobia, pornography, drugs, classism, consumerism, sex, and living in violent environments. Then, Kivel provides the practical tools to empower boys to take the courageous step out of the ""act like a man"" box and become allies to themselves, each other, and all those who are vulnerable to violence and injustice in our society. The end result gives the reader a powerful vision of raising our sons to be the critically thinking, socially-invested men we need for a multicultural and democratic society.<br>
<br>
<i>Boys will Be Men</i> is for all parents who have a vision of a society where peace and justice exist; for parents raising their sons in economically disadvantaged communities; for feminists who feel confused about raising their sons, and for parents of color who need to add their sons' strength to their communities.<br>
<br>
<b>Paul Kivel</b> is the author of <i>Men's Work</i> (1998, Ballantine) and <i>Uprooting Racism</i> (1996, New Society Publishers, 0-86571-338-3). He is the founder of the nationally recognized Oakland's Men's Project and hasconducted hundreds of workshops on racism and anti-violence for teens and men all over the country.

<p class=""null1"">The Awakening: Pre- and Post-Stonewall Riots (1967-1975)</p>
<p>By the early 1970s the political establishment was beginning to take notice of the fledgling movement. In the August 16, 1972, issue, Rob Cole reported on the attempt by a spokesman for Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern to distance the liberal senator from one of the first unequivocally pro-gay statements from a national candidate. ""I hope for the day when we do not need to specify that 'Liberty and Justice for All' includes blacks, Chicanos, American Indians, women, homosexuals, or any other group,"" McGovern said. ""ALL means ALL.""</p>
<p>Despite such progress, gay life sometimes resembled a war zone. In the August 1, 1973, edition, the newspaper reported that an arson fire at the Up Stairs, a popular New Orleans gay bar, had killed 32 men. A photo depicted the charred body of a man frozen in place trying to escape the fire through a window. (The arson remains unsolved.) The same issue carried a photo of the Rev. Ray Broshears, a Metropolitan Community Church minister in San Francisco, brandishing a shotgun after announcing the formation of the ""Lavender Patrol"" to combat ""teenage attacks on homosexuals.""</p>
<p>The newspaper was not without reports of victories, some of them historic. The January 16, 1974, edition reported, in ""Sick No More,"" that the American Psychiatric Association's board of trustees had voted 13-0 to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Psychiatrists had studied the lives of gays and lesbians and found no evidence of pathology. The decision had far-reaching ramifications, effectively placing the scientific establishment on the side of gays andlesbians. Critics, however, noted that the change came only after years of lobbying from gay activists, and they refused to countenance the science underlying the vote.</p>
<p>As the feminist saying went, the personal was political. Four years earlier, the July 21, 1970, issue had carried a report on a medical-journal article by gay rights foe Charles Socarides asserting that homosexuality is a mental illness. Socarides, the article said, believed that homosexuality ""derive[s] from a 'faulty sexual identity' caused by a 'pathological family const</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 1.6314207388 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches",16.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/54/9781555834654.jpg,Success

<p><i>Petal Sweat</i> By Susan Kan</p>
<p>Rhonda Nickels never considered herself a poet, but lately she was drawn to the magnetic poetry kit on the refrigerator in the staff room at the women's health clinic where she worked. The lunchroom was a difficult place for her, she being shy and newly hired. Instead of trying to talk with the other nurses, most of whom spoke about their weekend escapades, dating dilemmas, or children, she would stand at the refrigerator, sipping from her milk carton. Rhonda was interested in their conversations, she had to admit, but she didn't know how to participate comfortably.</p>
<p>A recent graduate from a nursing school in a small Midwestern town, Rhonda's move to Boston had been a big change. Her family back home had been opposed to her leaving, but Rhonda felt the pull of the ocean, the salt spray, and the warm dunes calling out to her. Timid as she was, a kernel of adventurousness was burning inside her. At 31 years old, she felt it was now or never.</p>
<p>At the clinic she was efficient and well-versed in the language of the body, but she interacted with the patients as though they had brought their cars in for tune-ups and repairs. She could say the words breast, vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and Pap smear as easily as mountain, elevator, door, subway, and lunch.</p>
<p>Rhonda pulled the tiny magnets around the refrigerator:</p>
<p><b>sit there and I can cook eggs and meat</b></p>
<p>Not very poetic. The next day she made a list of rhyming words:</p>
<p><b>make lake steak bake fake take</b></p>
<p>One day, about a month into her new city life, as she searched for words, she noticed on the side of the refrigerator facing away from the room a line of wordsall by themselves:</p>
<p><b>we am love by doing</b></p>
<p>Rhonda looked sheepishly around the room to see if anyone saw her. The others were absorbed in the latest <i>People</i> magazine, the one with <i>The First Wives Club</i> actresses on the cover. Turning back to the five simple words, Rhonda thought, <i>Bad grammar</i>. Then after thinking a moment, she wondered, <i>We am love by doing what?</i></p>
<p>Obviously, as a nurse, she knew. She knew what the books said. But as much as she hated to confess this, she had never been in love, and she had</p>",en,First Edition,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.6834330122 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",12.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/02/9781555835002.jpg,Success

Drawing on their diverse spiritual backgrounds (Orsborn is Jewish and a student of Eastern philosophy; Kuner studied with a Sufi teacher; Quigley has undergone 12-Step programs; and Stroup is a Christian minister), the authors have crafted a framework that allows women to view their cancer as part of an encounter with their deepest selves. They postulate five stages through which initiates travel on the journey from fear to acceptance: impact, chaos, choices, community and spirit. As each author relates her experiences--such as confronting fears of death, pain and isolation, choosing between mainstream and alternative therapies and enduring the loss of hair, self-esteem, friends and, in once case a fianc --she suggests ways to counter the prevailing view of doctors and patients that patients who fight back stand the greatest chance of being healed, that survivors are winners and those who die have lost their battles.

However, each of us can respond to any of these things in a manner of our own choosing. <i>The Courage to Give</i> is an amazing collection of stories by thirty people about their situations and their chosen responses. As Joan Lunden, former host of Good Morning, America writes in her foreword: It is easy to stay in a place of pain, wondering 'Why me?' questioning life, or feeling sadness and sorrow. But if we make the effort to help someone else, we begin the healing process for ourselves. Each one of us has the ability to answer that call to action. If we identify a need in our community or hear someone crying out for help, we can and we must answer the call. The people Jackie profiles in this book, in spite of their physical or emotional pain, heard the call and sprung into action, making a difference in our world. Their courage inspires us to remember, even in the face of adversity, our responsibility to each other and ultimately to ourselves. It's one of the most wonderful compensations of life-that no person can sincerely try to help another without helping themselves.</p>",en,Illustrated,"Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches",10.42,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/55/9781573241755.jpg,Success

Others insisted that Jones could not have been harassed because the president did not punish her for refusing him. During the impeachment debate, many feminists defended the president on the grounds that his alleged lies in the Jones case were ""just about sex"" and therefore insignificant. In the most publicized sexual harassment case to date, longtime proponents of sexual harassment law raised the political and legal thresholds for taking sexual harassment seriously.In a passionate defense of the rights of sexually harassed women, Gwendolyn Mink warns that the president's supporters have undermined our sexual harassment laws. Hostile Environment is her provocative account of the harm being done to these laws and her warning that the laws themselves are worthless if few women dare to use them.Correcting many common misapprehensions, Mink explains sexual harassment as a legal concept and charts its judicial and legislative history. She shows the many important contributions feminists have made to the development of sexual harassment law. She also, however, develops a stringent critique of feminist responses to the president's lies in the Jones case. Sometimes scathing, Hostile Environment provides a fresh perspective on the recent politics of sexual harassment. It also provides a highly personal perspective. First-hand knowledge of the injuries caused by sexual harassment and its aftermath has left Mink with an abiding interest in this volatile issue and with a desire to safeguard the rights of sexually harassed women-especially the most economically vulnerable among them.",en,1,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.74 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches",43.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/44/9780801436444.jpg,Success

By that criterion, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 has been successful indeed: throughout the nation, millions have vanished from the welfare rolls. But what has been the cost of this success to the women and children who were the overwhelming majority of recipients?<P>Here a group of distinguished feminist scholars examines the causes and the impact of recent changes in welfare policy. Some of the authors trace the politics of welfare from the 1960s, emphasizing how attitudes toward motherwork and working mothers have evolved in the backlash against poor women's motherhood. Several other authors consider the effects of the new welfare policy on employment and wages, on the lives of noncitizen immigrants, on poor women's ability to escape domestic violence, and on their reproductive and parental rights. A third set of authors explores dependency and caregiving, along with the role of feminist thinking on these issues in the politics of welfare.<P>Whose Welfare? concludes with a historical analysis of activism among poor women. illuminating that legacy, the volume challenges readers to build progressive agendas from the demands and actions of poor and working-class women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",0.00,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/03/9780801486203.jpg,Success

0-8014-8637-8,Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,"Reich, Nancy",Cornell University Press,416,2001-07-15,Paperback,"<p>This absorbing and award-winning biography tells the story of the tragedies and triumphs of Clara Wieck Schumann (1819-1896), a musician of remarkable achievements. At once artist, composer, editor, teacher, wife, and mother of eight children, she was an important force in the musical world of her time. To show how Schumann surmounted the obstacles facing female artists in the nineteenth century, Nancy B. Reich has drawn on previously unexplored primary sources: unpublished diaries, letters, and family papers, as well as concert programs. Going beyond the familiar legends of the Schumann literature, she applies the tools of musicological scholarship and the insights of psychology to provide a new, full-scale portrait.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. In Part One, Reich follows Clara Schumann's life from her early years as a child prodigy through her marriage to Robert Schumann and into the forty years after his death, when she established and maintained an extraordinary European career while supporting and supervising a household and seven children. Part Two covers four major themes in Schumann's life: her relationship with Johannes Brahms and other friends and contemporaries; her creative work; her life on the concert stage; and her success as a teacher.</p>
<p>Throughout, excerpts from diaries and letters in Reich's own translations clear up misconceptions about her life and achievements and her partnership with Robert Schumann. Highlighting aspects of Clara Schumann's personality and character that have been neglected by earlier biographers, this candid and eminently readable account adds appreciably to our understanding of a fascinating artist and woman.</p>
<p>For this revised edition, Reich has added several photographs and updated the text to include recent discoveries. She has also prepared a Catalogue of Works that includes all of Clara Schumann's known published and unpublished compositions and works she edited, as well as descriptions of the autographs, the first editions, the modern editions, and recent literature on each piece. The Catalogue also notes Schumann's performances of her own music and provides pertinent quotations from letters, diaries, and contemporary reviews.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches",17.4,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/71/9780801486371.jpg,Success

As the first woman section editor at the Times, Curtis was a pioneering journalist and one of the first nationwide to change the nature and content of the women’s pages from fluffy wedding announcements and recipes to the more newsy, issue-oriented stories that characterize them today. In this riveting biography, Marilyn Greenwald describes how a woman reporter from Columbus, Ohio, broke into the ranks of the male-dominated upper echelon at the New York Times. It documents what she did to succeed and what she had to sacrifice. Charlotte Curtis paved the way for the journalists who followed her. A Woman of the Times offers a chronicle of her hard-won journey as she invents her own brand of feminism during the 1960s and 1970s. In the telling of this remarkable woman’s life is the story, as well, of a critical era in the nation’s social history.</p>",en,,"Height: 8.50392 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.8125968 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/57/9780821412657.jpg,Success
0-8014-8620-3,Whose Welfare?,,Cornell University Press,288,1999-10-20,Paperback,"<p>Over the past few decades, the goal of welfare reform has been to move poor families off of welfare, not necessarily out of poverty. By that criterion, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 has been successful indeed: throughout the nation, millions have vanished from the welfare rolls. But what has been the cost of this success to the women and children who were the overwhelming majority of recipients?<P>Here a group of distinguished feminist scholars examines the causes and the impact of recent changes in welfare policy. Some of the authors trace the politics of welfare from the 1960s, emphasizing how attitudes toward motherwork and working mothers have evolved in the backlash against poor women's motherhood. Several other authors consider the effects of the new welfare policy on employment and wages, on the lives of noncitizen immigrants, on poor women's ability to escape domestic violence, and on their reproductive and parental rights. A third set of authors explores dependency and caregiving, along with the role of feminist thinking on these issues in the politics of welfare.<P>Whose Welfare? concludes with a historical analysis of activism among poor women. illuminating that legacy, the volume challenges readers to build progressive agendas from the demands and actions of poor and working-class women.</p>",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches",0.00,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/03/9780801486203.jpg,Success

Government And Corporate Policies To Define And Enforce Fetal Rights Have Become Commonplace. Not Only Pregnant Women Are Affected By These Developments, As All Women Are Considered Potentially Pregnant For Much Of Their Lives. In Her Powerful And Important Book, Rachel Roth Brings A New Perspective To The Debate Over Fetal Rights. She Clearly Delineates The Threat To Women's Equality Posed By The New Concept Of Maternal-fetal Conflict,  An Idea Central To The Fetal Rights Movement In Which Women And Fetuses Are Seen As Having Interests That Are Diametrically Opposed. Roth Begins By Placing Fetal Rights Politics In Historical And Comparative Context And By Tracing The Emergence Of The Notion Of Fetal Rights. Against A Backdrop Of Gripping Stories About Actual Women, She Reviews The Difficulties Fetal Rights Claims Create For Women In The Areas Of Employment, Health Care, And Drug And Alcohol Regulation. She Looks At Court Cases And State Legislation Over A Period Of Two Decades Beginning In 1973, The Year Of The Roe V. Wade Decision Legalizing Abortion. Her Exhaustive Research Shows How Judicial Decisions And Public Policies That Grant Fetuses Rights Tend To Displace Women As Claimants, As Recipients Of Needed Services, And Ultimately As Citizens. When A Corporation, Medical Authority', Or The State Asserts Or Accepts Rights Claims On Behalf Of A Fetus, The Usual Justification Involves Improving The Chance Of A Healthy Birth. This Strategy, Roth Persuasively Argues, Is Not Necessary To Achieve The Goal Of A Healthy Birth, Is Oftencounterproductive To It, And Always Undermines Women's Equal Standing.

0-8014-3740-7,Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,"Reich, Nancy",Cornell University Press,416,2001-07-15,Hardcover,"<p>This absorbing and award-winning biography tells the story of the tragedies and triumphs of Clara Wieck Schumann (1819-1896), a musician of remarkable achievements. At once artist, composer, editor, teacher, wife, and mother of eight children, she was an important force in the musical world of her time. To show how Schumann surmounted the obstacles facing female artists in the nineteenth century, Nancy B. Reich has drawn on previously unexplored primary sources: unpublished diaries, letters, and family papers, as well as concert programs. Going beyond the familiar legends of the Schumann literature, she applies the tools of musicological scholarship and the insights of psychology to provide a new, full-scale portrait.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. In Part One, Reich follows Clara Schumann's life from her early years as a child prodigy through her marriage to Robert Schumann and into the forty years after his death, when she established and maintained an extraordinary European career while supporting and supervising a household and seven children. Part Two covers four major themes in Schumann's life: her relationship with Johannes Brahms and other friends and contemporaries; her creative work; her life on the concert stage; and her success as a teacher.</p>
<p>Throughout, excerpts from diaries and letters in Reich's own translations clear up misconceptions about her life and achievements and her partnership with Robert Schumann. Highlighting aspects of Clara Schumann's personality and character that have been neglected by earlier biographers, this candid and eminently readable account adds appreciably to our understanding of a fascinating artist and woman.</p>
<p>For this revised edition, Reich has added several photographs and updated the text to include recent discoveries. She has also prepared a Catalogue of Works that includes all of Clara Schumann's known published and unpublished compositions and works she edited, as well as descriptions of the autographs, the first editions, the modern editions, and recent literature on each piece. The Catalogue also notes Schumann's performances of her own music and provides pertinent quotations from letters, diaries, and contemporary reviews.</p>",en,Revised,"Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 1.18 Inches",95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/03/9780801437403.jpg,Success

At last in the late 1980s she set out on an excursion to Sichuan Province. That visit was the first of many she would make there on a remarkable double adventure: to gain a deeper understanding of Chinese women and to complete a difficult passage in her own life. Looking for Chengdu is her memoir of these trips. By turns analytic, witty, and bittersweet, Gates's observations on contemporary China are enlivened by a keen eye for the oddities of human behavior, including her own.The vast, inland province of Sichuan was the birthplace of the Chinese economic reforms of the 1970s, and is now speeding from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century. Was its economic boom transforming women's lives, Gates wondered? After a generation of socialist rule, would women risk the challenge of entrepreneurship? A feminist, she was especially curious to learn what Chinese of both sexes defined as women's rights.Gates traveled-by boat, train, bus, car, bicycle, and foot (her preference)-across the spectacular countryside, gleaning insight into China's massive bureaucracies from her experiences on an obligatory vacation, in a Tibetan dance-hall, and at a shouting match in her Chengdu home. She met dozens of hard-working, stylish women running family firms, and crossed paths with scholars and sailors. Her book is rich in anecdotes and compelling moments, from her journey through mountain villages in search of five thousand women with bound feet to low-voiced conversations about the Chengdu equivalent of the events at Tiananmen Square.A fascinating glimpse into the deeply personal vocation of anthropology, Gates's memoir will change the way readers think about the Chinese people.",en,1,"Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches",1.99,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/26/9780801486326.jpg,Success

0-8093-2193-9,We Are Coming: The Persuasive Discourse of Nineteenth-Century Black Women,"Logan, Shirley Wilson",Southern Illinois University Press,288,1999-08-04,Paperback,"<p>Shirley Wilson Logan analyzes the distinctive rhetorical features in the persuasive discourse of nineteenth-century black women, concentrating on the public discourse of club and church women from 1880 until 1900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logan develops each chapter in this illustrated study around a feature of public address as best exemplified in the oratory of a particular woman speaker of the era. She analyzes not only speeches but also editorials, essays, and letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logan first focuses on the prophetic oratory of Maria Stewart, the first American-born black woman to speak publicly. Turning to Frances Harper, she considers speeches that argue for common interests between divergent communities. And she demonstrates that central to the antilynching rhetoric of Ida Wells is the concept of ""presence,"" or the tactic of enhancing certain selected elements of the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her discussion of Fannie Barrier Williams and Anna Cooper, Logan shows that when speaking to white club women and black clergymen, both Williams and Cooper employ what Kenneth Burke called identification. To analyze the rhetoric of Victoria Matthews, she applies Carolyn Miller's modification of Lloyd Bitzer's concept of the rhetorical situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logan also examines the discourse of women associated with the black Baptist women's movement and those participating in college-affiliated conferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book includes an appendix with little-known speeches and essays by Anna Julia Cooper, Selena Sloan Butler, Lucy Wilmot Smith, Mary V. Cook, Adella Hunt Logan, Victoria Earle Matthews, Lucy C.

The 45-year-old single woman, here contrasts the stories of single teenage mothers with older career women who raise children without husbands. Limiting her interviews to several dozen women living near her home in the Cambridge, Mass., area, Ludtke does not offer a definitive analysis, but her skilled anecdotal research, buttressed by academic studies, gives a human face to a social phenomenon that deserves attention. Because teenage mothers often lack financial resources, their daily lives can differ significantly from those of older single mothers. But Ludtke notes similarities as well between the two groups, such as the feeling that motherhood will make their lives more meaningful and a concern that their offspring relate to positive male figures. Ludtke argues poignantly that adolescent pregnancy will be prevented only when adults develop ""the patience and perseverance to stick with troubled youth across the span of their adolescence.""</p>",en,Revised ed.,"Height: 8.7 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 1.60055602212 Pounds, Width: 1.22 Inches",33.95,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/07/9780520218307.jpg,Success

0-231-11580-6,Critical Condition,"Gubar, Susan",Columbia University Press,256,2000-02-15,Hardcover,"<p>Is feminism dead, as has been claimed by notable members of the media and the academy? Has feminist knowledge, with its proliferation of methodologies and fields, been purchased at the price of power? Are the conflicts among feminists evidence of self-destructive infighting or do they herald the emergence of innovative modes of inquiry? Given a feminism now ensconced within higher education as specialized or fractious scholarship, Susan Gubar's <i>Critical Condition: Feminism at the Turn of the Century</i> demonstrates that an invigorated concentration on activism and artistry can accentuate not the clinical or disparaging meaning of ""critical"" but its sense of compelling urgency and irreverent vitality.</p>
<p>As a pioneer of feminist studies -- and the object of some of the more rancorous criticism lodged against early feminist scholars -- Gubar stands in a unique position to comment on current dilemmas. Moving beyond defensiveness produced by generational rivalry, the impasse propagated by smug deployments of identity politics, and the obscurity of poststructuralist theory, she claims that the very controversies that undermine feminism's unity also prove its resilience.</p>
<p>Gubar begins by considering the volatile impact of gender on recent redefinitions of race, sexuality, religion, and class proposed by four important groups in contemporary feminism: African-American performance and visual artists, lesbian creative writers, Jewish-American women, and newly institutionalized female academics. She then addresses major divisions -- including the rifts between various area studies and women's studies, as well as strains between generations -- that both threaten and invigorate feminist inquiry. Gubar's forays into art and activism, politics, and the profession provide a sometimes distressing, sometimes comical, sometimes optimistic view of feminism emerging from a time of contention into a lively period of pluralized perspectives and disciplines.</p>

Koller, and their seventeen- year property dispute against the nation's leading cement corporation-the Atlas Portland Cement Company.</p><p>In 1903, Atlas built a plant on the border of the small community of Ilasco, located just outside Hannibal-home of the infamous cave popularized in Mark Twain's most acclaimed novels. The rich and powerful Atlas quickly appointed itself as caretaker of Twain's heritage and sought to take control of Ilasco. However, its authority was challenged in 1910 when Heinbach inherited her husband's tract of land that formed much of the unincorporated town site. On grounds that Heinbach's husband had been in the advanced stages of alcoholism when she married him the year before, some of Ilasco's political leaders and others who had ties to Atlas challenged the will, charging Heinbach with undue influence.</p><p>To help fight against the local lawyers and politicians who wanted Atlas to own the land, Heinbach enlisted the help of her shrewd and combative sister, Euphemia Koller, by making her co-owner of the tract. In a complex case that went to the Missouri Supreme Court four times, the sisters fiercely sought to hang on to the tract. However, in 1921 the county probate court imposed a guardianship over Heinbach and a circuit judge ordered a sheriff's sale of the property. After Atlas purchased the tract, Koller waged a lonely battle to overturn the sale and expose the political conspiracies that had led to Ilasco's conversion into a company town.

Barbara Walters and Connie Chung have even occupied the coveted network anchor's chair, if only briefly.<p>In this book, 70 of the foremost women in television news reflect on their professional successes, the personal and professional sacrifices that often bought those successes, and the barriers that still confront women in the news business. Weaving their interviews into a compelling text, Judith Marlane covers a wide range of issues, including looks versus ability and experience, sexual harassment, the resistance to women news anchors, the difficulties of balancing work and family life, women's and men's salaries, and the willingness of women to help other women in the business.</p><p>This book builds from Marlane's 1976 work, Women in Television News. Interviews with many of the same women highlight the gains that women have made in broadcast journalism.

Through arranged marriages, profitable alliances were made, territory gained and bridges built. But the women-though technically the possessions of their menfolk-were far from passive creatures. There are accounts of bravery and love affairs, papal separations and religious devotion.

Yet these experiences rarely surface in the increasing body of critical literature on womenâs travel writing, which has focused on European or American women traveling to exotic locales as imperial subjects. This stellar collection of essays offers a contestatory discourse that embraces the forms of travelogue, autobiography, and ethnography as vehicles for womenâs rewriting of flawed or incomplete accounts of Caribbean cultures. This study considers writing by Caribbean women, such as the slave narrative of Mary Prince and the autobiography of Jamaican nurse Mary Seacole, and works by women whose travels to the Caribbean had enormous impacts on their own lives, such as Aphra Behn and Zora Neale Hurston. Ranging across cultural, historical, literary, and class dimensions of travel writing, these essays give voice to women writers who have been silenced, ignored, or marginalized.</p>",en,2001,"Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.21474706362 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches",115,https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/63/9780312219963.jpg,Success

Abrams,160,1999-11-01,Hardcover,"<p>A pioneering force in the feminist art movement of the 1970s, Miriam Schapiro (b. 1923) is an internationally renowned artist. In this, the only comprehensive work on Schapiro, feminist art historian Thalia Gouma-Peterson traces Schapiro's career from her early gestural canvases to her legendary collaborations with other women artists to her femmages (feminist-oriented collages) to her tributes to female artists of the past. Best known for her large heart- and fan-shaped canvases layered with fabric and paint, Schapiro helped launch the Pattern and Decoration movement of the 1970s and '80s and developed a richly decorative style that has influenced a generation of younger artists. Noted scholar Linda Nochlin contributes an insightful foreword, while Gouma-Peterson draws from Schapiro's writings to convey the artist's reflections on art, art history, and the feminist movement.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Now in her seventies, Schapiro is one of the historic foremothers of the American feminist art movement. Yet, apart from Paula Bradley's dissertation, Miriam Schapiro (1983), this is the first work on the artist. The book, accompanying a Schapiro retrospective traveling around the country through 2001, includes 125 illustrations, 75 in full color. Research is based on the artist's notebooks and interviews by Gouma-Peterson, a longtime friend and art critic. Taking a psychoanalytic stance, Schapiro painted beautifully in Abstract Expressionism, then moved to several types of symbolic, geometric, computer-generated entities. The most characteristic works are her unique, highly patterned multimedia collage paintings of fabric and acrylic. From the 1980s on, Shapiro displays even more lushly conceived compositions, both figurative and postmodern.
